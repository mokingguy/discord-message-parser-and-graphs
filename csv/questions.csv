mlahk7#8009;26-Feb-17 12:40 PM;Pinned a message.;;
fine and dandy#9438;27-Feb-17 05:14 PM;First non mod post;;
Mtax#9787;28-Feb-17 07:52 AM;Channel descriptions are generally more efficent than pins.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;28-Feb-17 07:54 AM;"Agreed, I'm moving them over once they've got enough messages inside them, thought I'd fill it out first though";;
NinjaSaizo#0025;01-Mar-17 06:38 AM;HayleeLOL I got a question where is Aruu?;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;01-Mar-17 06:40 AM;Also tell me your top 3 FF games and what are your experiences (except for 7 & 10 since you told me already);;
HayleeLOL#0964;01-Mar-17 06:12 PM;She's not usually on discord haha!;;
HayleeLOL#0964;01-Mar-17 06:12 PM;and I'm honestly not sure D:;;
HayleeLOL#0964;01-Mar-17 06:15 PM;"probably 9, 4 and 5 as well, I think 5 is very underrated";;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 11:47 AM;Im starting FFXIII-2. How generous should I be with my monster leveling items? I feel like hoarding and saving them for worthwhile monsters but idk how abundant they are through the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 11:57 AM;"most of them are replaceable by nature, you likely won't find anything you really want to put lots of time into until you get to the end or atleast mid way";;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 12:00 PM;Cuz my caith sith healer sucks and idk if I should level it or wait for a better mob;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:01 PM;how far are you in the game atm?;;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 12:02 PM;"oh right early, i just beat Atlas in Bresha";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:02 PM;ah;;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 12:02 PM;Im just asking to get a feel of how I should pace myself when leveling mobs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:02 PM;yeah you won't have that many good healers for a bit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:03 PM;just go with what you think you will get the most usage out of;;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 12:03 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:03 PM;Since pretty much anything works for most of the game;;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 12:03 PM;kk;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:04 PM;"towards the end, and all of the DLC or secret bosses are where monster builds tend to matter";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:04 PM;other than you're good for everything else;;
Thalassocrat#8679;02-Mar-17 12:04 PM;thanks!;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 12:04 PM;np;;
JealousBass#4260;02-Mar-17 07:49 PM;Omega keeps killing me even with post Sealed Temple equipment;;
Thalassocrat#8679;03-Mar-17 08:04 PM;XIII-2: Can someone explain to me Time Reversal/Gate Seals? Do I lose anything of my progress or items or anything when I wind a zone back with it?;;
Thalassocrat#8679;03-Mar-17 08:04 PM;And what happens when I re-open the gate? I revert to my original playthrough? This is confusing.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Mar-17 08:07 PM;It lets you start an area over as if you never been there before;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Mar-17 08:07 PM;nothing else changes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Mar-17 08:07 PM;"oh and any chests you opened don't reset, this is mainly for story events and those live trigger things";;
Thalassocrat#8679;03-Mar-17 08:25 PM;hmmm kk;;
Thalassocrat#8679;03-Mar-17 08:25 PM;So the purpose is just like reviewing the events?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Mar-17 08:26 PM;pretty much;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Mar-17 08:27 PM;later on in the game you can enable a cheat (if that's what you want to call it) that will give you alternate endings for defeating specific bosses again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Mar-17 08:27 PM;"while it is enabled so, it has some uses but the main use is to just play through  different parts of the story again without starting over";;
Thalassocrat#8679;03-Mar-17 08:28 PM;"kk, I was trying to determine if it was something I wanted to use";;
Thalassocrat#8679;04-Mar-17 10:04 AM;"http://guides.gamercorner.net/ffxiii-2/tamed-monsters/chichu, , Are these guides optimal monster leveling guides, does anyone know? Ive been looking at what was a perfect chichu";;
NinjaSaizo#0025;05-Mar-17 11:22 AM;@HayleeLOL#0964;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;05-Mar-17 11:22 AM;Why do you play LOL;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;05-Mar-17 11:23 AM;League;;
HayleeLOL#0964;05-Mar-17 12:05 PM;I enjoy it haha;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;05-Mar-17 02:49 PM;What makes you say that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:54 PM;oh league is pretty fun;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:54 PM;"I need to get back into it but I've been busy, been like a month since the last time I played lol";;
Grey Watcher#0412;05-Mar-17 02:55 PM;I found it boring to play solo and you usually meet toxic people;;
Grey Watcher#0412;05-Mar-17 02:55 PM;I mute them or play with friends only;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:55 PM;(plus I need that Bloodmoon Jhin skin my life);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:55 PM;you meet toxic people in every online game;;
DuskNocturne★ ☆#8326;05-Mar-17 02:55 PM;but LoL is like bathing in a vat of pure toxicity;;
DuskNocturne★ ☆#8326;05-Mar-17 02:56 PM;as is with every MOBA;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:56 PM;meh it isn't that bad;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:56 PM;so someone tells you to kys;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:56 PM;big whoop;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:57 PM;like I've seen worse;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:57 PM;especially if the game has voice chat;;
Grey Watcher#0412;05-Mar-17 02:57 PM;"I've seen worse people, really";;
Grey Watcher#0412;05-Mar-17 02:57 PM;I just join in and start muting everyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:58 PM;I only mute if someone is being annoying in chat;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Mar-17 02:58 PM;like spamming so that you can't communicate with the rest of the team;;
DuskNocturne★ ☆#8326;05-Mar-17 03:03 PM;most of my experience with LoL is blatant racism and disgusting behaviour;;
Desert Stream~#1192;07-Mar-17 03:43 PM;Does ffii have any optional content in GBA version;;
Desert Stream~#1192;07-Mar-17 03:43 PM;aside from soul of rebirth;;
Desert Stream~#1192;07-Mar-17 05:50 PM;ok guessing no;;
HayleeLOL#0964;07-Mar-17 05:51 PM;"I know VI has a boss, it's possible";;
Desert Stream~#1192;07-Mar-17 05:54 PM;Well a lot of games have bosses;;
Desert Stream~#1192;07-Mar-17 05:54 PM;I already wrote down iron giant so I think I'm good;;
HayleeLOL#0964;07-Mar-17 05:54 PM;"I mean, an extra boss";;
HayleeLOL#0964;07-Mar-17 05:55 PM;haha;;
Desert Stream~#1192;07-Mar-17 05:55 PM;yes;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:15 PM;How the fuck does LR battle system works?;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:15 PM;"Lighting has like 3 jobs, huh???";;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Mar-17 03:15 PM;you change clothes and mash buttons;;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Mar-17 03:15 PM;that's all I know 😛;;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Mar-17 03:15 PM;I think the more clothes you get the more jobs you have;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:15 PM;idk it is pretty straight forward;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:16 PM;like what part doesn't make sense to you?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:16 PM;its like a more streamlined version of the first two games I suppose;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:16 PM;Can you pick the jobs or are 3 default jobs?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:17 PM;you get more as you go through the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:17 PM;can only switch through 3 in battle;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:17 PM;"you give them abilities, accessories, weapons etc...";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:17 PM;(and also changing colors if you want);;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:18 PM;Like old school jobs like in 3?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:18 PM;not really but I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:19 PM;the different Schematas don't force a specific role on you;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:19 PM;they just have different designs and stats;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:19 PM;and may have one or two locked abilities;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:19 PM;you generally want to go for jobs that don't have any locked abilities though;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:20 PM;Well I seem to understand now;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:21 PM;"Oh cool, the 13-2 costume for Lightning";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:21 PM;"Thanks for the answers, I'll just have to look a gameplay from the start and see how it works";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:21 PM;her original one is in there too;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:21 PM;or play it myself;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:21 PM;"Yeah, noticed it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:21 PM;I miss LR now that I think about it;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:22 PM;"Buy it on sale, it looks good.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:22 PM;I remember when it originally came out I played it for 2 weeks straight;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:22 PM;non stop;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:22 PM;I probably will get it on steam since I sold my PS3 a while back;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;I want to skip 13-2 cause I heard it's meh;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;and play LR first after I beat 13.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;LR makes zero sense without 13-2;;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;13-2 is really fun;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;13-2 has the better gameplay than 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;but the story is weaker;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:23 PM;and shorter;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:25 PM;"Oh well, I'll try it";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:25 PM;Should I finish 7 or 13 first anyway?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:25 PM;how far are you in both;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:25 PM;7 I'm at Shinra HQ where I need to sneak or Barret gets mad;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:25 PM;13 I'm going to Vanille/Fang's village;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:25 PM;finish 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:26 PM;you're pretty much at the end;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:26 PM;or rather;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:26 PM;very close to it;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:26 PM;"After I found village, is there any other open world parts?";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:26 PM;pls no;;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Mar-17 03:27 PM;No;;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Mar-17 03:27 PM;it goes linear again 😃;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:27 PM;nah;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:27 PM;N o i c e;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:27 PM;I'll get 13-2 when on sale and finish 7 then;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:28 PM;isn't the game like $15;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:28 PM;"Then LR, and try to find a way to play Tactics, Advance 1 and 2 and Revenant Wings";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:28 PM;what kind of sale are they going to do for it? lol;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:28 PM;It goes like 7$;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:28 PM;Why not?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:28 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:29 PM;TBH I bought full priced FF7 on Steam;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:29 PM;$8 difference doesn't matter to me;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:29 PM;"I know, but I feel like I will get the game and never finish the others";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:30 PM;ah;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:31 PM;"By the time I finish 13 or 7, I'll finish the remaining one and get the other on sale";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:31 PM;"Oh I also have Mobius, if that counts.";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:32 PM;"SHIT, now I want to get 13-2 on full price";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:33 PM;mobius is long term and even the japanese version doesn't have an ending yet;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:33 PM;lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:33 PM;they're also 4 chapters ahead;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:34 PM;Bastards;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:34 PM;"Well, I didn't play it since 1 month ago but it's not bothering me with full space.";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:38 PM;How does 13-2 battle system works?;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:38 PM;"Like only 2 character, what's with their jobs?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:44 PM;it's the same as 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:45 PM;but the 3rd slot is reserved for monsters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:45 PM;13-2's combat changes are more like a updated version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:45 PM;"for example, not having to wait a million years for the paradigm shift animations to play";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:46 PM;Thank fuck.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:46 PM;balances to the crystarium system and adding monster catching;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:46 PM;World of Final Fantasy 13-2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:46 PM;each paradigm can have a different monster though since monsters have only one role;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 03:47 PM;or you can use the same one in all paradigms;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:51 PM;"Oh, seems weird";;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:52 PM;Or not probably.;;
Grey Watcher#0412;08-Mar-17 03:57 PM;Like jesus christ when I change shift it takes too long;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 04:02 PM;they also removed haste kinda;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 04:02 PM;in 13-2 you can only get it by having a preemtive strike;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 04:04 PM;oh and water spells are gone for some reason;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Mar-17 04:04 PM;apparently they are still in the game's code just unused;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:08 PM;@Dinoken2#0946;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Mar-17 06:08 PM;Yes hello;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:08 PM;Yo I have some stuff to ask;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:08 PM;Hi;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Mar-17 06:08 PM;Shoot;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:08 PM;Alright what makes 8 your favourite;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Mar-17 06:10 PM;It was my first is really the main reason.  I'm also a sucker for a good romance.;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:10 PM;I see;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Mar-17 06:10 PM;I also like Squall quite a bit and Rinoa was my first waifu;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:10 PM;I think I don't need to explain why I love 7;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:11 PM;I see;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:11 PM;Apparently your one of the few who loved 8;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:12 PM;I think Squall is underrated but Zidane as well;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Mar-17 06:13 PM;"I am.  I love it to death and I think a lot of the reasons people hate it are a bit exaggerated or just wrong, but I'll be the first to tell you VIII has flaws";;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:13 PM;Thing is when ppl think FF 7 comes to mind;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Mar-17 06:13 PM;Yes even Vii has flaws;;
alp#3140;08-Mar-17 09:33 PM;FF7 really was quite a mess... but a mess in the sense of spilling liquid gold all over a fancy carpet.;;
Desert Stream~#1192;09-Mar-17 05:12 PM;is there a way to get infinite amounts of every sphere in FFX;;
Desert Stream~#1192;09-Mar-17 05:12 PM;or at least enough to complete the sphere grid;;
JealousBass#4260;09-Mar-17 05:37 PM;iirc no;;
Dinoken2#0946;09-Mar-17 05:40 PM;Grinding the monster arena;;
Desert Stream~#1192;09-Mar-17 05:40 PM;the monster arena? Hmm;;
Dinoken2#0946;09-Mar-17 05:44 PM;Yeah.  Look up on the wiki what drops what;;
Dinoken2#0946;09-Mar-17 05:44 PM;It's time consuming;;
Desert Stream~#1192;09-Mar-17 05:47 PM;I kinda regret deciding to 100% every game;;
Desert Stream~#1192;09-Mar-17 05:47 PM;oh well;;
HayleeLOL#0964;09-Mar-17 07:40 PM;"Grinding the arena, grinding Gil for Bribe because some bribes give you spheres I believe";;

Grey Watcher#0412;10-Mar-17 01:10 AM;"Should I play 4, 5 or 6?";;
Grey Watcher#0412;10-Mar-17 01:10 AM;I like played them each for 10 minutes and found them boring as kid;;
Grey Watcher#0412;10-Mar-17 01:11 AM;Just tell me now that I'm grown up;;
DuskNocturne★ ☆#8326;10-Mar-17 02:10 AM;"I personally say 4, but most usually swear by 6.";;
Crab#6594;10-Mar-17 03:49 AM;so then play 5;;
Crab#6594;10-Mar-17 03:49 AM;😏;;
Grey Watcher#0412;10-Mar-17 03:51 AM;"Yeah, going for 5";;
Grey Watcher#0412;10-Mar-17 03:51 AM;It's the least one I played.;;
alp#3140;10-Mar-17 05:33 AM;honestly I liked 4 and 5 much more than 6;;
alp#3140;10-Mar-17 05:34 AM;5 is really underrafed... but I'd suggest giving them all a chance;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;10-Mar-17 06:29 AM;@HayleeLOL#0964 the profile pic before this was that you IRL?;;
HayleeLOL#0964;10-Mar-17 07:01 AM;Yeah it was haha;;
HayleeLOL#0964;10-Mar-17 07:01 AM;Changed it because of some random discord thing with friends haha;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;11-Mar-17 02:01 PM;So do I HAVE to break Zu's beak for beaks? Or can I just kill her?;;

Crab#6594;11-Mar-17 08:10 PM;What does and doesn't transfer when you transfigure a Mirage in WoFF?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:13 PM;depends on how you transfigure;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:14 PM;if it is in the same family then all white abilities transfer;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:15 PM;if it is of a different family (tonberry -> paleberry) then only level does;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:16 PM;and accumulated mirage points;;
Crab#6594;11-Mar-17 08:16 PM;and the stats improves don't right;;
Crab#6594;11-Mar-17 08:16 PM;like defense+ and etc;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:16 PM;stats are per monster;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:16 PM;so L size might be worse in some stat areas than S size or M size;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:17 PM;check the ratings on stats;;
Crab#6594;11-Mar-17 08:17 PM;So there isn't any point in filling out stats nodes from other mirages in the family;;
Crab#6594;11-Mar-17 08:17 PM;Like filling out critical++ in a white nakk board doesn't affect fenrirs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:18 PM;oh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 08:18 PM;those should transfer;;

Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 08:43 PM;"Hello guys, I do kinda have a question.  In addition to loving FF, I'm a big time tabletop RPGer.  There is a Pathfinder FF mod that is really well done online and I'm wondering if any fanboys/fangirls here would be interested in that sort of thing?";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 08:53 PM;"Hello there.  I am also big into tabletop RPGs but I've never really touched Pathfinder.  I've played a bit of 4e, a lot of 5e, a lot of Savage Worlds, a tiny bit of World of Darkness, a one session of the Warhammer RPG as well as experimenting/attempting to learn Icons and the Dresden Files RPG (Which are both children of the Fates system).  Pathfinder though is a system I've never really explored.  It's a bit more of a number crunchy game than what I prefer, but that might actually work with FF.  All that being said, I'm always willing to try new things when it comes to table top so I'd be down to give it a try.  My schedule is a little tight though, so that might be an issue.";;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 08:57 PM;"Oh, thanks for the feedback!  I will let the question seep out, and see what I come up with.  I have no proposed schedule as of yet, but if there is enough interest, I will get with folks to see what works!";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:01 PM;"Oh no problem.  I love tabletops.  I have two different groups I meet with on a weekly basis.  One plays 5e, the other Savage Worlds.   I've given a lot of thought to how to make a tabletop FF game and had some ideas on a 5e homebrew, but like I said, Pathfinder might work better.";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Mar-17 09:02 PM;"I've never done any kind of tabletop RPG, I had kind of a dnd going with some other friends but it floped. I want to try it out and if you are willing to help me/teach I would gladly join 😃";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:02 PM;Tabletops are the best.;;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:03 PM;The key is finding a group that meshes well and can meet consistently.;;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:03 PM;"If you can find that group, it's one of the greatest experiences you can have.";;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:15 PM;"I agree.  I'd actually love a group that is less experienced with pathfinder, and explore the world together.  I was gonna ask in the Pathfinder discord, but I think a group that's more focused on the FF part of it would be better.";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:16 PM;I do know a bit about the Pathfinder setting.  My one groups Savage World's campaign is a converted version of the Pathfinder Skull and Shackles campaign.;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:16 PM;oh that's neat;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:16 PM;I actually have yet to run a game in the actual Pathfinder world;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:16 PM;I just finished a WoW game using pathfinder with my wife and some friends;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:17 PM;I ran a Final Fantasy 6: The After Years many years ago with D&D 3.5;;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:17 PM;That must've been interesting.  Did you loosely follow the Warcraft story or did you just play on Azeroth?;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:17 PM;I did 70 years post-cataclysm and made my own shit up;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:18 PM;but I used WoW lore;;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:18 PM;Very good.  Half the fun of DMing is making up your own stuff;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:18 PM;definitely;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:18 PM;"they met Algalon and stuff, the Paladin wound up weilding Talsalach";;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:19 PM;it was good fun;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:19 PM;"I'm really excited by the FF mod though, I saw it years ago, and never found a group cause I moved";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:22 PM;"I bet.  My 5e group just finished our campaign recently.  We're currently taking a break by playing a few board games, the one player is a big Kingdom Death fan and wants to introduce our group to it.  But after the break we're probably gonna run a Star Wars campaign using Savage Worlds that's gonna essentially be KotOR.  I'm gonna be the GM and I'm stupid excited to mess around in that universe.";;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:22 PM;Oh man I love KOTOR;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:22 PM;If I ever did Star Wars it'd be that;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:22 PM;I hope the do a 1-off movie in the old republic;;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:23 PM;God I'd love that.  KotOR is my favorite era of Star Wars.;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:23 PM;def the best;;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:24 PM;"The plan I have for them is to basically follow the path of the game with collecting the Star Maps, but I was just going to have them be on different planets with different subplots so we don't just literally rehash the game.  One of the players also never played the KotOR games so they're unaware of the big twist";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:24 PM;It's gonna be great.;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:24 PM;nice;;
Dracheau#3535;15-Mar-17 09:25 PM;"Well, I will keep checking back to see if any Final Fantasy Pathfinder interest develops.  For now, I must retire to an inn room to gain rest xp.";;
Dinoken2#0946;15-Mar-17 09:25 PM;Rest up my friend.  Enjoy your tavern RP session.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 07:35 PM;probably in the original japanese scripts there may have been a point where that happens;;

NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 07:42 PM;like swearing?;;
JealousBass#4260;16-Mar-17 08:22 PM;ye;;
Dracheau#3535;16-Mar-17 09:03 PM;XII is a really good story about a small kingdom conquered by an Empire;;

Dinoken2#0946;17-Mar-17 06:19 AM;"Ashe may be the main character, but my boy Balthier is the leading man";;

Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 06:34 AM;"Hi! I'm completely new to FF, i own 7,10, and 15. But i haven't played any of them. I was told that i should start with 10. But I'm not really sure what's going on ?? What is X-2 ? What should i be playing lol";https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/292999205990039552/received_1624258960935358.jpeg;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 06:35 AM;Do all the FF games tie into eachother or are they just set in the same universe ?? Completely new haha;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:40 AM;all the games are separate from one another asides from the direct sequels;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:40 AM;so FFI and FFVI are completely seperate;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:40 AM;but FFX-2 is the sequel to FFX;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:40 AM;"FFX is a great game to start with , btw";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 06:42 AM;"i hear 7 is the best, is that true ? so should i just go down this list then ?  start with X and end with final fantasy X-2 last mission";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:42 AM;"7 is a popular one because , for many, it was their first FInal Fantasy game. It is a good game, and it's certainly not a bad one to start with";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:43 AM;"you don't have to go down the list as such, you can play them in any order";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 06:43 AM;"I mean I went 7, 9, 8, 6, 10 to start with";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:01 AM;"@Aruu#2066  cool man, so if the games are not linked why are they all under the FF franchise?";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:02 AM;are they set in the same unvierse or are they all just differnt storys;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:02 AM;"well it's the title of the series. and yes, they're all different stories";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:02 AM;"they share similar themes and items, but ultimately they're all their own universe/story";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:03 AM;one last question - what is FF X eternal calm ? and ff x-2 last mission you said X-2 is set after X but im just wondering what to expect from this game haha;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:03 AM;thanks :)!;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:04 AM;FFX eternal calm is basically a short movie set between FFX and FFX-2;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:04 AM;"FFX-2 does play differently from FFX, but it follows a couple of the same characters from FFX";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:05 AM;"i hope i find out who that girl in black is, she looks cool";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:05 AM;"When you dive into X-2, keep in mind that it's a different game.  It's story is drastically different in terms of theme and tone.";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:05 AM;Paine is very cool;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:06 AM;"or Lulu.. depending on which game you mean, come to think of it. Lulu is in FFX, Paine is in FFX-2";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:06 AM;Paine is a good character.  Definitely one of the best things in X-2;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:06 AM;"i always hear good things about FF so i think im gonna play X, then X-2 and then ill move onto XV or something  and im talking about the girl with grey hair";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:06 AM;ahh yeah then that's Paine;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:07 AM;and good idea! FFX really is a great game to start with;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:08 AM;"my frined is trying to get me into kingdom hearts, and i said i have never played FF but i own a few of them so shes gonna beat me unless i get into these games now hahah.";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:09 AM;"i play alot of resident evil, dark souls so this will a good change of pace playing FF :p";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:10 AM;"Kingdom Hearts is a great series.  You don't need to know FF to play it, and if you wanted to so you can understand the cameos, VII and VIII have more characters that are more relevant than any other game.  X has a few characters in KH but they're pretty much entirely cameos, whereas Cloud and Squall are actually important to the game's main plot.";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:12 AM;i wanted to play FF for ages but they seem like super long games so never found the time with work as well but  i might as well play them now if they are as good as everyone says;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:12 AM;FF is nowhere near as difficult as Dark Souls.  If you can learn the leveling/combat mechanics of the game you're playing and don't run from the battles you face you should be fine.  Earlier titles might require a bit of grinding but overall you can finish the main stories without too much hassle.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:12 AM;"The definitely are super long, especially if you're a completionist.";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:15 AM;"im not really a completionist, i just play for fun but i do like the grind of games like DS and the difficulty of games like resident evil so im hoping FF is like that im going to start X now but thankyou for all the help!  ill have discord open so ill pop in if i need anything else 😃 thanks again!";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:15 AM;"hahaha i have my first question, what is a sphere grid";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:16 AM;it's how you level up your characters;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:16 AM;you move along it and activate nodes;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:16 AM;"which teaches them new skills, and gives them points in certain attributes; like strength, magic, agility, etc";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:16 AM;is it worth going for expert;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:17 AM;or is there not much of a change between the too;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:17 AM;I'd go for standard for your first playthrough;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:17 AM;"basically the difference is that in standard, your characters have sort of set paths";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:17 AM;"while in expert, they don't";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:17 AM;"so your magic characters will follow a path that helps boost their magic teaches them magic skills, etc";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:17 AM;"while in expert you can basically take a character down any path, but that can be a little more complicated";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:18 AM;Also I think if you want max out character stats you have to use the standard grid as it has more slots.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:18 AM;There's a chance I might have that reversed but I don't think so.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:19 AM;Although really unless you're going for the super bosses in the postgame you don't need to max your stats;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:20 AM;"ahhh i see, ill stick to standerd then ,";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:20 AM;went for the original sound track too;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:21 AM;im guessing all these people around the fire are my group or something;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:22 AM;The opening scene of X starts you like 2/3 of the way through the main game and then flashes back to the begining.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:22 AM;It's one of those stories.;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:22 AM;well everything looks in ruins hahaha;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Mar-17 07:24 AM;"there's always something in ruins, lol";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:25 AM;"hes a pimp, this stripper looking blond guy";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:25 AM;"hes chatting up some girls atm, jokes";;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:26 AM;Tidus does kind of look like a stripper...;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:27 AM;is this game fixed carma angles ? or is it jsut the start of the game;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:29 AM;"it is for the most part, yeah";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:33 AM;Also the voice acting in X can be a little rough.  Especially Tidus.;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:33 AM;i have noticed hahahaha. im learning about sin right now;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:44 AM;this auron seems like abit like a dick;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Mar-17 07:47 AM;Auron is the best character in X.;;
Aruu#2066;19-Mar-17 07:49 AM;love Auron;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 07:54 AM;i love these semi fixed camra angles;;

Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:28 AM;"@Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481 I started with 10, and it was great";;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:30 AM;"Starting with the old games (1-6 mostly) can be a bad thing, because the series has changed a lot";;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:31 AM;"And 13 gets horrible reviews, so that might not be the best game to start with";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 09:34 AM;@Desert Stream~#1192  yea im playing 10 atm then ill move onto 15 .  im enjoying 10 alot;;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:35 AM;"I will warn you, the games get tough. Especially if you try to defeat the optional bosses";;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:35 AM;"And I hope you aren't a completionist, because 100%ing 10 takes YEARS";;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 09:37 AM;"it cart actaully take years surly hahaha, im not a completionist really. if i wanted to 100% a game i would but i havent really ever wanted too,  im a huge dark souls fan so im going to start bloodborn but im busy with ffX atm :p";;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:37 AM;ok good;;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:38 AM;I assume you've seen the sphere grid by now?;;
ClawViper#4825;19-Mar-17 09:38 AM;Enjoy! I've enjoyed FFX so much that I went out to 100% it so feel free to ask anything 😄;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 09:38 AM;"im on that atm, im learning about power spheres atm";;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:40 AM;completing the sphere grid 100% on every character is the part that takes years;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 09:40 AM;why ? do you just have to keep winning battles with them ?;;
Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;19-Mar-17 09:40 AM;or is it like a NG+ type thing;;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:41 AM;"well, 1 level lets you move 1 space";;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:42 AM;there are hundreds of spaces;;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:42 AM;Tidus's section alone has 117 I think;;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:42 AM;then you actually need spheres to unlock each one;;
Desert Stream~#1192;19-Mar-17 09:42 AM;But it's worth it when every character can doublecast ultima for 1 mp xD;;

Dharkan#9641;22-Mar-17 03:03 PM;Is there any difference playing FFX HD remaster on pc or ps4?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;22-Mar-17 03:05 PM;"well, on pc you can use a keyboard";;
Desert Stream~#1192;22-Mar-17 03:06 PM;"maybe graphics and stuff, but I don't think so";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:13 PM;"So pretty much, the choice you have is watching the Tidus laugh scene on your computer monitor versus your television screen";;
Dharkan#9641;22-Mar-17 03:20 PM;I'd play with controller in any case;;
Dharkan#9641;22-Mar-17 03:20 PM;but it is turn based anyway so i guess it doesn't matter;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:28 PM;The visual options don't do anything but make it match what the ps4 adds;;

Dharkan#9641;22-Mar-17 03:35 PM;I think I'll just pass it all together;;
Dharkan#9641;22-Mar-17 03:35 PM;I get bored playing turn based rpg;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:39 PM;it's like 16 years old lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:44 PM;"It's kind of like the orginal Deus Ex then, you can add as many graphical mods to it as you want, but it's still not going to really look like a game from 2017";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:47 PM;I suppose;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:47 PM;but I wasn't really factoring in mods I guess lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:47 PM;I've seen that 4K texture thing for FFX though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:47 PM;they should do one that updates all of the models though;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:48 PM;"The trouble is, you can bumb up the textures all you want, but it'll still look like blocks";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:48 PM;exactly;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:48 PM;and that's what that mod looks like;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:49 PM;"At that point though, you might as well remake the entire game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:50 PM;I hate how square only bothered to update the main cast visually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:50 PM;so now they stick out from everyone else;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:50 PM;The dev team for Type 0 did the same shit;;

Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:51 PM;"Oh geez, that sounds like it could be jarring";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:51 PM;"it is, like for example the eyes";;

Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:54 PM;Like here: https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FspnBFUvbYJY%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:56 PM;yeah the mesh is rough;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:56 PM;"They clearly touched up *some* of the models, but others are still in need of some love";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:56 PM;Notably: Link and that bridge;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:56 PM;honestly it takes nothing to hit that subdivide button;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 03:57 PM;especially on natural environments like that;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:57 PM;Saria's house still looks like it has triangular prisms for roots;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:58 PM;(The house with the white stripe);;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:59 PM;Link is still being sliced and diced by grass though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:00 PM;the grass has been upscaled;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:00 PM;Very much so;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:00 PM;It used to just be a block with textures on all sides;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:00 PM;yeah the upscaling causes the pixelated parts to become gradients;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:00 PM;"If you look closely though, you'll see Link clipping through some grass";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:01 PM;tbh grass and vegatation is one of the most frustrating parts of designing an engine;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;Very true. Breath of the Wild actually nailed that aspect;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;You also forgot water;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;Realistic water is something that we have yet to actually master;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;"idk, water it depends on how complex it is";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;like if it is just simple static water or streams that's easy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:02 PM;but simulation;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:03 PM;physics reacting;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:03 PM;Yeah;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:03 PM;It's especially obvious at the edges of the water;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:03 PM;I've yet to see an engine that allows waves to bounce off the walls instead of clipping into it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:04 PM;most use shaders to get rid of edges;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:05 PM;"there was this trick I remember, you could use the depth buffer to simulate a fall off but it doesn't always work";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:05 PM;Don't even get me started on how game engines treat waves in beaches;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:06 PM;All that we can so far do is pale imitations of waves in beaches;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:06 PM;it's all a big lie for the sake of visuals;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:06 PM;like how variable time step games are a frame behind;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:07 PM;because it has to update via interpolation between two frames;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:07 PM;I'm aware that a lot of game design is just cheap tricks;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:07 PM;yup;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:08 PM;I think another part of it is that we just haven't really figured out how fluids really work from a physics standpoint;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:09 PM;most of it is just;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:09 PM;the hardware can't handle it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:09 PM;so these tricks exist to sort of make it work;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:09 PM;"Not even, let me give you an example";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:09 PM;like fitting a square block in a circle hole;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:10 PM;"You know when you pour honey into another pot of honey, how the honey spirals around as you're pouring it?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:10 PM;yeah;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:10 PM;"Well, modern physics has literally no explanation for why it does that";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:11 PM;"We have equations that describe the behaviour, but nothing that actually tells us why it does that";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:12 PM;"Sounds incredibly stupid, I know, but that goes to show that we are still scratching our heads when it comes to fluids";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:12 PM;"well the why doesn't really matter as long as you can replicate it with something similar I've seen a lot of fluid simulations and they are pretty good, not perfect";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:13 PM;but even then that stuff doesn't work in a real game setting until the hardware and software become capable enough;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:13 PM;like how we still have a big difference between game rendering and CGI;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:13 PM;gap has shortened but still exists;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:14 PM;"Yeah, I mean, perfect water simulation (simulating at the molecular level) is a serious ways off because the hardware is simply not powerful enough yet";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:15 PM;"That's pretty much graphics programming for games in a nutshell, over the years I've learned that a lot of these techniques, tricks, etc... often only serve the purpose of getting a desired effect on something that can't handle it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:16 PM;and forces you into specific design paths because of it;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:16 PM;"Shortcuts, in other words";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:16 PM;more like this will suffice kind of things;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:17 PM;taping up stuff and hoping it doesn't fall apart in the end;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:17 PM;Yeah. I think a good example of that is how OOT handles interior environments as opposed to how Majora's Mask handles them;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:18 PM;"OOT's way was rather interesting. Instead of simulating an interior environment, they just had an upscaled drawing with 'hitboxes'";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:18 PM;This is because of RAM limitations at the time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:18 PM;ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:18 PM;reminds me of the pre-rendered stuff from back in the day;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:18 PM;backdrops op;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:19 PM;"Yeah, Majora's Mask actually did render interior environments though, but it required that a 4MB expansion card be added the the N64";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:20 PM;This thing: https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ebayimg.com%2Fimages%2Fi%2F141393958684-0-1%2Fs-l1000.jpg&f=1;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:21 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:21 PM;never owned a n64 but I knew people who did and I always wondered what it was for lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:21 PM;(thought it was a memory card or something);;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:21 PM;"Yeah, I had more or less the same reaction you did, though I actually had (and still have) an N64";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:24 PM;"I just noticed though, that the controllers only had 3 wires, if those controller ports are any indication";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:24 PM;I wonder how signals were sent to the system...;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:25 PM;"Did they use all 3 wires as a bus, or did they just use 2 wires for power and one of them as a bus";;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:27 PM;"Ah, I see, so they used only one of the wires as a signal wire: https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/fomartin/hookup-clipart.png";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:29 PM;hardware wiring is outside of my domain lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:30 PM;"```All data is transmitted on a single, half-duplex wire (the signal wire plugged into pin 25 above). When this wire is idle, it is high (hence the pull-up resistor). If a falling edge is detected, it means that bits are being transmitted. Bits are transmitted in 4μs intervals. For a 0, the wire is low for 3μs and high for 1μs. For a 1, the wire is low for 1μs and high for 3μs. In order to read a bit, you must simply wait for a falling edge, and then read the wire 2μs after the falling edge. If the wire is high, the value is a 1, if it is low, the value is a 0. All transmissions end with a 1 bit that is not followed by a falling edge, called the signal bit.```";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:30 PM;I remember seeing a video of some guy who cracked the Sega Saturn's disc DRM;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:30 PM;by disassembling the processor or something;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:30 PM;And what that looks like: https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/fomartin/protocol.png;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Mar-17 04:30 PM;might have been the cd drive chips;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:31 PM;It's always interesting to see how developers worked around limitations back in the day;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 04:34 PM;What you just told me reminded me of how they crack the DRM in a 360;;

Dinoken2#0946;26-Mar-17 09:47 AM;FE Heroes wouldn't really fit with our server considering Fire Emblem is a completely separate and very different franchise from Final Fantasy.

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 01:55 PM;also I guess the name casual is a bit misleading if you looked at the names alone;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 01:58 PM;most shitpost channels I've seen including one I've governed in a server I help manage are just places where people can go crazy with memes;;

Deleted User#0000;27-Mar-17 02:08 PM;it allows for memes and such without declaring it to be a shitpost channel which seems kind of lame to me;;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:08 PM;Casual is a pretty useful umbrella title;;

themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 02:12 PM;But Beverage said is more like a  /r/casual__;;

Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:12 PM;I think casual is supposed to be a more 'fun' channel. General is more of a discussion area? but they do overlap quite a bit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 02:13 PM;"from my understanding based on the descriptions of the channels, #general is for FF talk and talk of the subreddit, #off-topic is for everything but FF, #deleted-channel is for images and memes";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 02:14 PM;yet all three names sound so similar until you read their descriptions;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 02:17 PM;yeah I just don't see the name reflecting the proposed usage #deleted-channel;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 02:20 PM;"I think what @Deleted User#0000 meant when he re-named the chanel was some place to go and talk about any stuff. like Hey guys, I just got on a train and im bored ¡, lets talk about something kind of like r/CasualConversation";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 02:24 PM;I think the issue is possibly the comparison to subreddits. Has anyone been in an actual discord server that uses casual or something similar as a term for memes or joke channels?;;

Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:38 PM;that's right. unfortunately I'm on a different timezone from the majority of the mods;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 02:38 PM;Is not like life or death;;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:39 PM;The channels aren't exactly strict either;;
Random#1318;27-Mar-17 02:39 PM;there is a private chat;;

NinjaSaizo#0025;27-Mar-17 02:41 PM;Spoilers?;;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:41 PM;Spoilers were bad enough when it came to the subreddit;;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:41 PM;"which, thanks to automod, we were able to grab before people saw them";;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:42 PM;but on here? a lot more difficult;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 02:42 PM;I loved you guys work on the spoilers on the subreddit;;

Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 02:43 PM;signing up with user names like 'SO AND SO DIES';;
NinjaSaizo#0025;27-Mar-17 02:43 PM;Why?;;

Dinoken2#0946;27-Mar-17 07:52 PM;Modding on Reddit is pretty simple.  Our sub is fairly tame.  There's the occasional insult heavy comments and a bit of self promotion but otherwise r/finalfantasy is a pretty peaceful place.   We ban repeat offenders who break our rules but it's so uncommon.;;
Dinoken2#0946;27-Mar-17 07:52 PM;Sorry was driving home from work;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:42 PM;the first game was supposed to have dlc but they left it out due to time constraints;;

Desert Stream~#1192;02-Apr-17 09:43 PM;ooo the steam version has the dlc;;
Desert Stream~#1192;02-Apr-17 09:43 PM;that's convienent;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:43 PM;I think they still require you to pay;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:43 PM;which is pretty meh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:43 PM;for a re-release;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:45 PM;XV has dlc;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:45 PM;but like most of it is shit you aren't going to use for more than the first 2 hours of gameplay;;
Desert Stream~#1192;02-Apr-17 09:45 PM;oh so it's like weapons and stuff?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:45 PM;mainly yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:46 PM;then there's the character dlc stories;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:46 PM;and this isn't really dlc but;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:46 PM;for some reason they keep updating the game with timed quests;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:47 PM;which boils down to you fighting a reskined enemy;;
Desert Stream~#1192;02-Apr-17 09:47 PM;lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:47 PM;and they shower you with AP and gil;;
Desert Stream~#1192;02-Apr-17 09:47 PM;I hope 12 gets ported to pc before I finish 1-10-2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:47 PM;the current one gives like 777k;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:48 PM;They'll probably do it to cover the dev costs of another big game somewhere down the line;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:48 PM;or atleast a year or so after it has been out on PS4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Apr-17 09:50 PM;That's kinda what sparked their interest in mobile games with shitloads of microtransactions and random ports to mobile and PC/PS3/PS4;;

Dinoken2#0946;03-Apr-17 08:45 PM;Hello there;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;03-Apr-17 08:46 PM;what is the worst FF story?;;
JealousBass#4260;03-Apr-17 08:46 PM;Gentoo;;
Dinoken2#0946;03-Apr-17 08:48 PM;"It's a matter of preference, but I don't think the early (I-III) have aged well and I'm also not a big fan of XIII.";;
Dinoken2#0946;03-Apr-17 08:48 PM;Oh misread that;;
Dinoken2#0946;03-Apr-17 08:48 PM;Thought it was just worst FF;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;03-Apr-17 08:48 PM;lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;03-Apr-17 08:54 PM;"Uh the answer is pretty much the same to be honest.  I know XIII has its fans but I wasn't too keen on it.  Other than that uh... I'd have to say VIII?  It's my favorite but the story has a lot of flaws.  XII would've been infinitely better without Vaan and Penelo.  VII's story is not very new reader friendly with all the retcons it's gone through.   The SNES games stories are a little basic took.  Idk they all have problems (except X and IX IMO) but put a gun to my head and I'd say either I, II, III, or XIII";;
Dinoken2#0946;03-Apr-17 08:55 PM;Oh XV's story wasn't that great either I think.  The last arc really brought it down but I don't want to get too into that discussion because of spoilers;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;03-Apr-17 08:57 PM;I see;;
Davkilla101#0932;03-Apr-17 08:57 PM;Yeah XV started falling apart around chapter 12 I think;;

alp#3140;04-Apr-17 11:44 PM;alright can anyone help me get through this map in FFT?;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/299041477525241859/Orbonne-battlefield2.jpg;
alp#3140;04-Apr-17 11:44 PM;"im using a knight ramza, agrias, a white mage (w/ cure, cura, protect, shell, raise) and a black mage (w/ every -ra spell and blizzaga)";;
alp#3140;04-Apr-17 11:45 PM;and an archer;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 03:25 AM;what jobs do you have access to;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 03:28 AM;technically you can get through almost fight in the game by changing everyone to chemist and equipping all of them with guns;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 03:29 AM;except for limberry/riovanes 2;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 03:30 AM;"but if you want minor changes to your setup, change your knight and archer to something stronger - they are pretty damn weak at this stage of the game";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 03:30 AM;and their attacks are easily blocked/dodged with shields + mantles if the enemies are equipping them;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 07:14 AM;"I would have to agree.  I used ninjas, and they move so fast, and can 1 shot the time mages before they ruin you.  I always thought knights and archers were just gateway classes, I rarely did major fight with them except the very beginning.  Can you get arithmaticians?  I used them heavily to either kill or debuff everybody at once.";;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 07:19 AM;"I'm sorry.  I played FFT recently, but I can't remember exactly where you are in the game.  Fortunately, grinding is always an option.";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 07:30 AM;this is orbonne 1;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 07:30 AM;haha;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 07:30 AM;"But yes, knights and archers are just gateway jobs";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 07:45 AM;"ah, alright";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 07:45 AM;the thing is with this map I can't go back and grind and I was too stupid to make a separate save slot;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 07:45 AM;but I don't have any units that can access ninja yet;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:20 AM;"Then kill cleric and mages first, I think the holy sword techs have decent vertical range, so maybe you can hit them.  Also, boots that increase your movement range is always good.";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 09:34 AM;"i also have a monk (w/ pummel, cyclone, aurablast, and doom fist) a thief (w/ steal gil and steal xp)";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 09:34 AM;so should i use any of them? or mustadio?;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 10:03 AM;"Mustadio is good to immobilize the fighter types, so you can go after the mages.  If he's leveled enough, I'd use him instead of an archer.";;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 10:03 AM;I wouldn't bother with monk or thief;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 10:28 AM;alright;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 11:47 AM;"thief is a terrible job except for certain fights where you want to steal equipment, e.g. chantage from a certain enemy later in the game";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 11:48 AM;monk is powerful early to mid but at this point it should not be very useful anymore;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 11:48 AM;later in the game you want attacks that are unblockable/very high hit chances over physicals;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 11:48 AM;e.g. agrias' holy sword;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 11:58 AM;yeah im only even bothering with thief so i can grind it for better jobs;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 11:58 AM;and at this point same goes for monk;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:07 PM;"get ninja asap, and samurai too for shirahadori";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:07 PM;"if you want to break the game, you can go for arithmetician but tbh it makes the game very unfun cause you'll kill everything in 1-2 turns by then";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:07 PM;so what should i make ramza?;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:08 PM;ramza can do anything well cause he has the extra physical attack for males and the extra magical attack for females;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:08 PM;he does well in any strong physical job/magical job;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:09 PM;if you ask me for best possible option it would be squire + math skill as secondary if you're just looking at pure strength;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;alright;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;at this part in the game i cant rly grind tho;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;do you have access to lancer at least?;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;thats a powerful class;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;i think i do;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;you need the spear and a decent range for the jumps tho :/;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;"but for now i'll be taking agrias, mustadio, blk mage and wht mage to these fights";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:10 PM;yeah that sounds good;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:11 PM;should be winnable as long as your magic isnt too far behind;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:11 PM;its a bit behind i think but its workable;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:11 PM;"wht mage has cure, cura, protect, shell, and raise";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:11 PM;blk mage has -ra spells and blizzaga;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:11 PM;thats strong enough;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:11 PM;"you can give the priest black magic/summon magic secondary, same with black mage";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:12 PM;im using time as secondary for my blk mage;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:12 PM;but i only have haste and slow;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:12 PM;haste is really good if your units have decent faith so that it doesnt miss often;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:13 PM;yeah it's been rly helpful;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:14 PM;cast mass protect at the start of battle if possible too!;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:14 PM;that way the lancers wont destroy you;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:15 PM;yep ive been doing that;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:15 PM;i actually cleared the map i posted earlier;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:15 PM;should i give my blk mage poision or save for another -ga spell?;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:17 PM;i just realized how much JP agrias has... should i get hallowed bolt or divine ruination?;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:34 PM;save;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:34 PM;poison is useless;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;"that's a good question,  divine ruination is stronger but i prefer hallowed bolt personally";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;if you prefer to hit enemies in a straight line then divine ruination;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;but hallowed bolt is more flexible for me;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;im moreso looking for pure damage;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;so divine ruination?;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;divine ruination then;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;alright;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:35 PM;the targetting is a straight line;;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 12:36 PM;while hallowed bolt is similar to the first skill with slightly longer range;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 02:02 PM;I made Ramza a dark Knight and it was game over at that point.  Killed the final boss before it got a turn.;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 02:03 PM;"You're right about the game being easy with certain classes.  This was my first playthrough, so I wanted to power through, but it would be fun to try different approaches.";;
ClawViper#4825;05-Apr-17 02:33 PM;There's actually the Straight Character Challenge for those who wants to make the game challenging and utilise their classes to their limits haha;;
Skiz#2578;05-Apr-17 04:18 PM;"Finishing up with Kingdom Hearts 1 for the first time playing with a friend over discord, the follow up on his childhood favourite is going to be mine.. Final Fantasy 9.. I already got it on steam, there is no way around the black bars on the sides i assume?";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 04:19 PM;i dont think so but try playing around with the aspect ratio and see how that works;;
Skiz#2578;05-Apr-17 04:23 PM;"meh, might aswell go 4k.. all resolutions have the bars";;
Skiz#2578;05-Apr-17 04:23 PM;i just checked;;
Skiz#2578;05-Apr-17 04:24 PM;"IIRC FF9 didn't had any character voices, right?";;
Brojotaro#6578;05-Apr-17 04:25 PM;nope;;
HayleeLOL#0964;05-Apr-17 07:50 PM;"No, but if you count technicalities, Garnet is the first character with a sort of voice";;
Brojotaro#6578;05-Apr-17 07:54 PM;Rinoa also had a voice;;
Brojotaro#6578;05-Apr-17 07:54 PM;In the space scene you could hear her breathing;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 07:57 PM;I just got Luso in FFT WotL;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 07:57 PM;is he worth using?;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:15 PM;Which one is he?;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:16 PM;this guy;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/299351533496041472/luso.jpg;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:17 PM;Oh.  I never did.;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:17 PM;ah;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:17 PM;he's only in the PSP version;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:18 PM;"Yeah.  I leveled him a little, but ultimately didn't use him.";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:18 PM;ohh i thought you were saying that you never got him..;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:18 PM;he can use shout tho i think;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:18 PM;which is nice;;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:18 PM;"True, shout it good.";;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:18 PM;Ramza gets it later though;;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:19 PM;"yeah, but for now he's my only unit with shout";;
Dracheau#3535;05-Apr-17 08:19 PM;"I think I was just invested in other people.  If you level him into a cool class, he'd be as good as anyone else.";;
alp#3140;05-Apr-17 08:19 PM;alright;;
ClawViper#4825;06-Apr-17 05:11 AM;His innate Secret Hunt is good if you're into poaching monsters for loot I guess;;
ClawViper#4825;06-Apr-17 05:11 AM;but I never use him;;
alp#3140;06-Apr-17 06:45 AM;I've been using him in some random battles;;
alp#3140;06-Apr-17 06:45 AM;he's much stronger than any of my other units I have at the moment;;
alp#3140;06-Apr-17 05:58 PM;ok does anyone have a save generator for FFT WOTL bc my vita memory card just shat itself and i lost my save;;
Dracheau#3535;06-Apr-17 09:37 PM;noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo;;
Brojotaro#6578;06-Apr-17 09:39 PM;I know a trick maybe;;
alp#3140;06-Apr-17 09:40 PM;tell;;
Brojotaro#6578;06-Apr-17 09:44 PM;tell you in PM;;
alp#3140;06-Apr-17 09:44 PM;alright;;
Random#1318;07-Apr-17 01:54 PM;They should port FFT to Steam and II&I;;
alp#3140;07-Apr-17 01:56 PM;yeah;;
alp#3140;07-Apr-17 01:56 PM;it could really use a nice upres imo;;
alp#3140;07-Apr-17 01:56 PM;just not the FF6 kind;;

NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Apr-17 06:10 PM;or you can get a certain few;;
HayleeLOL#0964;08-Apr-17 06:10 PM;You don't have to - they're entirely optional to get;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Apr-17 06:10 PM;No I am trying to fight Ozma;;

HayleeLOL#0964;08-Apr-17 06:19 PM;Okay! Have a nice day ^^;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:38 PM;@NinjaSaizo#0025;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:39 PM;You have to get the golden chocobo so you can fly to Ozma.  To get that you need a majority of the chocographs.  To make Ozma significantly easier you should do the friendly monster side quest;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:39 PM;Also equip gear that blocks or absorbs shadow damage;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:40 PM;And have Vivi and/or Amarant with the return magic skill;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:40 PM;Preferably Vivi at least and spam doomsday;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:41 PM;I forget if Steiner can do doomsday sword or not but if he can you should have him with Vivi and then Eiko to heal;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:42 PM;Zidane should physical attack or use thievery (whichever does more) and back up heal using items;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:44 PM;That's a basic plan for beating Ozma.  There's a bit of RNG but if you prep right you should be fine as long as you do something along those lines;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:48 PM;You should ideally be around level 60;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 06:49 PM;"You can also swap out Eiko for Dagger if you need to, but if they're around the same level use Eiko.  She's a better white mage while Dagger is a better summoner";;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Apr-17 08:53 PM;I see @Dinoken2#0946;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Apr-17 08:53 PM;this Helps alot;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;08-Apr-17 08:53 PM;any tips for the minigame itself?;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 08:59 PM;If you're playing the Steam version you can use the I forget what they're called modifier things to speed up the game which will make you move around and dig much faster without speeding up the mini game clock;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Apr-17 09:00 PM;Otherwise no aside from just get a general feel for where the items like to spawn and remember that the whole map is fair game;;

NinjaSaizo#0025;13-Apr-17 10:10 PM;@Dinoken2#0946 why ppl hate Squall;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;13-Apr-17 10:11 PM;I love him personally;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;13-Apr-17 10:11 PM;Not better than Cloud;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;13-Apr-17 10:11 PM;But still;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Apr-17 10:20 PM;"Squall is my favorite.  A lot of people dislike him because of the infamous Bed of Woe scenes where Squall lies in bed and remembers his childhood and comes off as very whiney and, for lack of a better term, emo.  Add to this that Squall rarely speaks to the party, prefering to keep his thoughts to himself so there's a lack of interaction with other characters.  And when Squall does talk to others, especially for the first 2/3rds or so of the game he's often either straight to the point, rude, condensending, and mean.  He's not a very likable person.  That being said, Squall's arc in the game is him giving up the rude persona and allowing his true self to shine through as he gets over his abandonment issues with the help of Rinoa.  A lot of people play through the FF games just once and don't remember a lot of the game and are thus left with their first impression and the infamous Bed of Woe scenes as their memory of Squall.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Apr-17 10:36 PM;@NinjaSaizo#0025 does that answer your question?;;

Redcrimson2#0506;19-Apr-17 08:09 AM;in FFIV when you get the paladin do you still need to keep the dark knight armour? or can you happily sell it?;;

Technobliterator#1311;19-Apr-17 08:14 AM;"Ah. It might be a good idea to grind for Gil a bit, since you'll need to grind for levels in that version anyway";;
Redcrimson2#0506;19-Apr-17 08:14 AM;yeah I've noticed already up to this point has been brutal compared to 6-15 starts lol;;
Technobliterator#1311;19-Apr-17 08:17 AM;"Yeah, IV DS and onward is a really hard game";;
Technobliterator#1311;19-Apr-17 08:17 AM;You're expected to grind quite a bit;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 08:22 AM;It was hard on snes too.  The bosses are brutal later on.;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 08:22 AM;"But, you could cheat for unlimited excalibers";;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 08:22 AM;Lol;;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 09:24 AM;I think the mobile version of FFIV has an easy mode as well as the regular difficulty;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 10:21 AM;I may need to check that out.  I could never beat Golbez at the end on snes.;;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 10:29 AM;you mean after calcabrina?;;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 10:29 AM;"and, I should clarify the easy mode on the mobile version is about the same as the original version I think";;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 10:30 AM;the regular difficulty is the Japanese difficulty and is much harder;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 10:32 AM;Damn;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 10:32 AM;I probably slacked off on grinding near the end;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 10:33 AM;"Oh well.  If i finally get through V, ill go back to IV.  Never played the newer versions.";;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 01:27 PM;"Question: someone said theres a necromancer class in FFV?  I just beat neo exdeath, where did i miss it?";;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 01:34 PM;Wait.  Credits finally finished.  I guess theres more.;;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 01:54 PM;which version are you playing?;;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 01:54 PM;"it's not in the original version, only GBA, PC, and mobile";;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 01:54 PM;so if you're playing the SNES or PS1 version the answer is no;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 01:57 PM;I'm on the mobile version;;
Dracheau#3535;19-Apr-17 01:58 PM;They must've added end game content like in mobile FFVI;;
alp#3140;19-Apr-17 01:58 PM;"yeah, you should be able to get necromancer";;

ClawViper#4825;02-May-17 06:16 PM;"your starting seed rank is based on a number of criteria, this is one of the criteria (finishing the mission with just almost no time left will net you the most points for that criteria)";;

Nvanz13#7594;03-May-17 07:34 PM;"Yeah, the initial SeeD exam is pretty confusing, but it really doesn't matter too much in the long run. It's pretty easy to get max SeeD rank, all you have to do is do the tests and win battles for the most part, there are other things that increase and decrease it throughout the game as well, but I don't remember them all off the top of my head. You do lose points everytime you get your payout, but ten killed enemies (unless killed with GF) will make up for it.";;

Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 10:50 PM;Well I can just write them all down;;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 10:50 PM;and be careful;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 10:50 PM;typically you use a guide to keep track of what you can and can't sell;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 10:51 PM;iirc you have to either have had the items before;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 10:51 PM;missables are the worst thing in video games;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 10:52 PM;because they take so long;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 10:54 PM;I mean personally I can't really think of any games with missables that aren't jRPGs;;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:01 PM;acheivements?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:02 PM;do they count as missables?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:02 PM;mmmmmmmmmm;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:02 PM;maybe?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:02 PM;depends on the game;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:03 PM;well I guess we could count Half-Life 2 then;;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:04 PM;Ik a few games with missable acheivements;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:05 PM;technically a bunch of Assassin's Creed achievements are missable because they're multiplayer and the multiplayer is dead in the earlier games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:06 PM;are the servers down?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:06 PM;(also who the fuck realistically played those games online?);;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:07 PM;well that's not really missable;;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:07 PM;because;;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:07 PM;that's uh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:07 PM;if the servers are down they are;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:07 PM;get a friend;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:07 PM;"why would someone play, say, Brotherhood's multiplayer when the multiplayer in, say, Black Flag is better";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:07 PM;easy;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:08 PM;and also you need more than two people for AC multiplayer;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:08 PM;it's like a literal game of Assassin;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:08 PM;ok get a group of friends;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:08 PM;I mean yeah that's a great hypothetical but sure it'd work;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:08 PM;(also Black Flag was trash tbh);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:09 PM;"honestly, the only part of AC I like is the ezio arc";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:09 PM;please consider removing yourself from this earth;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:09 PM;but no I get that;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:10 PM;what assassin's creed actually is doesn't appeal to everyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:10 PM;"no seriously, BF was like a snooze fest";;
Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:10 PM;imo missable and unobtainable are different;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:10 PM;maybe because I'm not into like;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:10 PM;ah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:10 PM;I get it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:10 PM;"so any time I got on it, I would get super bored";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:10 PM;it's funny because BF is generally one of the most well-liked games in the series;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:10 PM;I did like the singing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:10 PM;and the off pirate ship parts;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:10 PM;but that single aspect alone was the reason why I couldn't complete the game;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:11 PM;I may be one of the few people that actually care more about the modern day storyline and just see the animus stuff as a means to worldbuilding;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:11 PM;got stuck on a big pirate boss raid thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:11 PM;so I went back to like;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:11 PM;and I stopped playing;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:12 PM;MMOs generally aren't;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:12 PM;would be impossible anyway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:12 PM;but I was playing the PS3 of BF;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:13 PM;though interestingly a certain set of fake MMOs *are* and are very fun to exploit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:13 PM;2013;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:13 PM;"or something, I think that's when the game came out";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:13 PM;I refer to the Artix Entertainment games of course;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:13 PM;"ah, idk much about mmos other than FFXIV";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:13 PM;and I only know a little about it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:13 PM;since I have not finished ARR's story yet;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:14 PM;these games weren't really MMOs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:14 PM;so like a bunch of FF12s?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:14 PM;lmao;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:14 PM;no;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:14 PM;they pretended to be multiplayer but they're ultimately just account-tied flash games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:14 PM;with non-live battles against other players;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:15 PM;uh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:15 PM;wtf;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:15 PM;interestingly for games geared towards children and younger teens they have pretty interesting storylines;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;well the thing is that *like* an MMO they continually released more content;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;which is why they often got compared to MMOs;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;also they were account tied because you could do a one-time purchase to upgrade to a premium version and access some extra content;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;I say were;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;still are;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;they're around;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;I open up AdventureQuest every so often;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:16 PM;do the next quest in a series;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:17 PM;close it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:17 PM;forget about it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:17 PM;etc.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-May-17 11:17 PM;so nothing really takes place on the server;;

Desert Stream~#1192;13-May-17 11:17 PM;ik nothing;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:17 PM;though it's pretty MOBA-ey too;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-May-17 11:18 PM;I like Overwatch but one of my suitemates literally plays it every night so I kind of hate it sometimes;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 01:55 PM;It was actually patched in a later release of the SNES version and the changes came to every release of the game from that point on;;

Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:09 AM;"Hey Guys, just started FF2 and the leveling up system is quite different compared to the other games. Any tips?";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:17 AM;Which version of FF2?;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:23 AM;Dawn of Souls;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:30 AM;"So, Dawn of Souls is really different compared to the original NES version which is what I'm generally use to.";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:30 AM;"Basically the things to keep in mind is that you don't need to abuse bugs to be able to better beat the game. Evasion (Using Shields) is extremely important, heavy armors restrict spell casting causing their damage to plummet, certain weapons are better for spell casting than others,  and spells are actually really good when you bother to level them.";;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:32 AM;"wait, so some weapons are better for spell casting? weapons such as Staves and Knives?";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:34 AM;Actually looking it up;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:34 AM;they took that out in the playstation version and onwards;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:34 AM;so never mind that;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:34 AM;oh.;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:35 AM;"so, use shields more often then right?";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:35 AM;Shields are great because they raise your agility;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:35 AM;and agility equates to more dodging;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:35 AM;and dodging is much better than tanking damage late game;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:36 AM;but what about characters that use bows?;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:37 AM;'cuz i want Maria to be able to use them;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:41 AM;You can put them in the backrow;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:41 AM;that will prevent them from most targeting;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:43 AM;It's up to you how you wanna run your party though;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:43 AM;"That's one of the great things about FF2, you can do just about anything with any party member";;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:43 AM;but it won't raise agility tho right?;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:43 AM;It won't;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:44 AM;"welp, guess i'd better use some staves and shields once in a while";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:44 AM;To bne fair;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:45 AM;if you really were super worried;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:45 AM;Later in the game just go outside the first town with dual shields on everyone and cast magic to clear it;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:45 AM;dual shields and naked;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:45 AM;you'll just gain agility super fast;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:46 AM;"oh, that seem's like a nice strategy";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:46 AM;Yeah;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:46 AM;it's directly related to your evasion rate;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:46 AM;Youy don't need to do it;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:46 AM;but if you find yourself getting stomped later;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:47 AM;it's probably one of the easier ways to level the playing field;;
Ultim8#9045;31-May-17 05:47 AM;nnice;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:50 AM;That being said;;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:50 AM;"you shouldn't really need to do it, but, a lot of enemies late game do % damage";;
Chimpy#5375;31-May-17 05:50 AM;which will get you massive HP gains;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-May-17 06:33 PM;pretty sure you can't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-May-17 06:33 PM;but you can get white wind in many different areas after that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-May-17 06:34 PM;the ruins in the first part of the game is just the most optimal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-May-17 06:34 PM;"also there's an item or something that can confuse enemies iirc, you can use that in place of the control ability";;
alp#3140;31-May-17 06:34 PM;i do like getting blue magics as early as i possibly can tho;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-May-17 06:34 PM;or atleast there should be;;
alp#3140;31-May-17 06:35 PM;"alright, i'll try that";;

Technobliterator#1311;04-Jun-17 06:24 PM;I spammed Black Mages;;

alp#3140;04-Jun-17 06:26 PM;"my current strategy that I've been using is casting golem and carbuncle, and casting lv5 black mag and aeroga onto my entire party";;
Technobliterator#1311;04-Jun-17 06:26 PM;Not really. Just change them to Black Mages and spam your best spells;;
alp#3140;04-Jun-17 06:28 PM;"hm, alright";;
alp#3140;04-Jun-17 06:28 PM;is carbuncle a lv4 or lv5 summon?;;

alp#3140;04-Jun-17 06:28 PM;its fine;;

ErusPrime#1115;07-Jun-17 08:09 AM;So is there a place to get mods for FF games that isn't a forum? I bet the type of people that think discussion forums as a platform for distribution are the same type of people that put cereal in before milk.;;
ErusPrime#1115;07-Jun-17 08:14 AM;"And with that, is there a way to open up modded games without a launcher? For example, I'm using 7H on FF7. I'd like to be able to launch the modded game directly with launchbox instead of opening the launcher and having to physically click the launch button. Kind of kills the couch PC vibe";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;07-Jun-17 08:15 AM;Steam community has some stuff for some FF games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;07-Jun-17 08:15 AM;and of course there are romhacks for the older ones;;
ErusPrime#1115;07-Jun-17 08:18 AM;I'm looking specifically for the psx games. Just to make them a bit prettier to record. FF7 seems okay but finding the updated stuff on qhimm is a huge pain in the ass and it seems only a couple people want to use a distribution platform like nexus.;;
ErusPrime#1115;07-Jun-17 08:20 AM;I think I'm good on 7 though. But ff8 is one of the ugliest games of all time. I don't need it now since I'm gonna do a series stream or LP of FF but I'd like to have things prepared and ready.;;

Davkilla101#0932;07-Jun-17 09:15 AM;">>8 uglier than 7, Ah yes, XV has literally unplayable graphics :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Jun-17 09:16 AM;"VII on the other hand has aged so poorly, it's a big reason I haven't been able to finish a replay of the game in years.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Jun-17 09:16 AM;And yeah we can all agree XV looks the worst.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Jun-17 10:26 AM;only parts of XV that looks good are the VFX and the closed off areas;;

Dinoken2#0946;07-Jun-17 11:22 AM;I played XII when it came out.  Didn't like it at first but the more I played it the more I enjoyed it.  Story is a bit odd in  that the player character isn't the main character.  Overall the game ranks higher on my list of FFs but it's been a long time since I played it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Jun-17 11:24 AM;I was ok with it;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Jun-17 06:06 PM;even though I don't like VIII as a game it is certainly not as aged as VII is;;
Lto#1172;07-Jun-17 06:07 PM;"ok, , as for gameplay, I think VII mechanics aged better, , never really the junction system, materia was a lot more easy to understand";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Jun-17 06:59 PM;"I didn't care for either system truly,  but I prefered junction.  Game play is more a matter of preference I think rather than graphics which was what the initial conversation was about.

pokemongenius#1474;10-Jun-17 09:28 PM;I have an interesting question for FF8 enthusiasts. Ok i wanted to know how does one figure out where to locate the UFO's in-game. I know Occult Fan describes two of the locations but not the rest. So what clues are there in game if any;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jun-17 10:30 PM;I'm not sure if there's any ingame clues towards it.  I've always used a guide for when I wanted to bang out that sidequest;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jun-17 10:30 PM;http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/UFO%3F;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jun-17 10:30 PM;That should help if you were just looking for where to go;;
pokemongenius#1474;11-Jun-17 12:39 AM;Like i already know where to go i just ran into someone wondering this question. I also used a guide but then how'd they know what to do too?;;
ErusPrime#1115;11-Jun-17 08:36 AM;Having some trouble with 7th heaven. The textures work fine the first time. When I stop playing and go back everything is messed up.;;
ErusPrime#1115;11-Jun-17 08:37 AM;I can't seem to isolate one specific mod. Anyone seen this before?;;
Dinoken2#0946;11-Jun-17 08:57 AM;"From what I can gather, aside from those two issues of Occult Fan there's in game hints.  I imagine the people who made the current guides online either used the official Brady Games guide or just trial and error'd it.";;
pokemongenius#1474;11-Jun-17 07:26 PM;Trial and error is a bit farfetched considering Diabolos is optional and you may never get Enc-None especially if you dont understand the Junction system well. I remember taking a real long time to learn the ins and outs;;
Dinoken2#0946;12-Jun-17 11:07 AM;"@{ xoxo }#5868  I don't have a video for you, but dragons in Final Fantasy are usually just monsters that the player has to fight.  There are a couple of exceptions like the Wind Drakes from FFV (http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Wind_drake)  or the recurring summon Bahamut (http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Bahamut)  but for the most part dragons are just another mindless enemy that show up in the random encounters.";;
Dinoken2#0946;12-Jun-17 11:09 AM;"And @pokemongenius#1474 that was just my guess.  Like I said, other than those two issues of Occult Fan there's no other hints in game as far as I know.";;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Jun-17 11:12 AM;It was worth askin I suppose;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:46 PM;hmm....;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Jun-17 09:46 PM;"I'd say either IV or X.  IV for the more classic NES /SNES stuff, X for the PS1+ games";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:46 PM;idk maybe X - XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:47 PM;if I had to narrow it down;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:48 PM;they may not be suited for someone who isn't used to how classical jrpgs work;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Jun-17 09:49 PM;PS1 games are fantastic if you can handle the dated graphics;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:50 PM;"either the most recent release of I, on the PSP (which is comparatively much easier than earlier releases) if you're into the idea of exploring with little direction and learning as you go, , or IV, also on the PSP, which has more direction and feels more like a modern FF";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:51 PM;I disagree;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:51 PM;that is the most anti newbie game in the franchise;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:51 PM;no that's FFII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:51 PM;no it's I;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:51 PM;I just fundamentally disagree;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:51 PM;because?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:52 PM;like how could you expect someone to enjoy a game that old if they aren't used to the genre?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:53 PM;this is more about what's more comfortable for a new player and I find I - III to be far from noob friendly games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:53 PM;"I don't find it anti-newbie at all?, , Yes it doesn't have much direction, but imo that's what's great about it, I wasn't used to the genre when I played it and I loved it, , and I hadn't played any of the classic games I'm known for playing back then, , then again I'm a unique case so I suppose take it as you will";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:54 PM;"but I would like to point out that FF1, when it first came out, was honestly designed to be a comparatively easy JRPG than what else was on the market, , It just seems hard now by comparison because the genre has gotten even easier";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:54 PM;"and nevertheless, I maintain that the PSP version is essentially pretty forgiving and not difficult";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:54 PM;I wouldn't say easier;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:57 PM;"Well in FF1's case, there isn't a lot that goes on storywise. The game in general is very simple in that regard";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:57 PM;though they're all about dungeon crawling to some extent;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:57 PM;it is one of the main reasons why it is so hard to enjoy for some gamers;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:58 PM;If you like the game just throwing you into a world and having to figure out every little detail on your own then try it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:58 PM;"I give it credit, It was one of the first games to do the particular type of plot it did, which I shall refrain from saying";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:58 PM;"oh yeah, IV is simple too";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:58 PM;decent story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:58 PM;easy to play and get into;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 09:59 PM;there's nothing confusing about it for new or veteran players imo;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:59 PM;"I generally recommend I or IV, , I've noticed a pattern that if you start with much later ones you're a good degree less likely to go back to earliers ones, , so that's why I try to have my recommendations pretty early in the series because you owe it to yourself to experience them";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 09:59 PM;IV's definitely a good choice;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:00 PM;I base my recommendations on what the person asking tends to like and what new players in general start with;;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-17 10:00 PM;I started on FF8 and 9 interestingly enough and it actually made me more curious about the earlier games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:00 PM;I don't mind telling someone to skip over the older games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:01 PM;tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:01 PM;they aren't for everyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:01 PM;just like the newer games don't sit right with everyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:01 PM;"That's why I always ask people what do they like, easier to narrow down where they should start";;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-17 10:02 PM;Its mostly Dissidias influence that led me to play them all;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 10:02 PM;"yeah but if you're new to the genre in general, why not start somewhere relatively simple?";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Jun-17 10:02 PM;My go to suggestions are IV and X.  Both are high points in the series and are good overall representations of what Final Fantasy is.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:02 PM;is XIII not a simple game?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:03 PM;or X;;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-17 10:03 PM;Most of the time ive dropped into a series it was always toward the middle or end;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Jun-17 10:03 PM;I think most of the games are realtively simple to learn.  There are a couple exceptions like VIII but even that one can be figured out eventually;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 10:03 PM;XIII is not really a good representation of the series tbh;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Jun-17 10:03 PM;I started with VIII having no JRPG experience and was able to get through the series fine.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:04 PM;It's not about representing the series though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 10:04 PM;"I get that, but we don't want to set false expectations";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:04 PM;because even that is inconsistent across all of the games;;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-17 10:04 PM;Ff8 has a lot of tutorials but most of the learning comes hands on as ive came to figuring it out;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Jun-17 10:05 PM;I guess I also have a fundamentally different attitude towards gaming in general so maybe that skews my opinions on this sort of thing;;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-17 10:06 PM;Everyone plays and thinks different your fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:06 PM;The franchise is just too diverse to say that any one game within represents all of the others;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:07 PM;Very different from something like SMT;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jun-17 10:07 PM;you can expect certain stuff from those games because most of them play very much alike;;

Dinoken2#0946;14-Jun-17 09:03 AM;Recently I've been playing a bit of Overwatch and Injustice 2.  Those are really just filler though till I figure out a single player game to play or untill XII:ZA comes out in a few weeks.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Jun-17 09:06 AM;"Female role models in the series?  Uh I guess I'd say probably Tifa (VII), Yuna (X), and Ashe (XII)?  Garnet, Freya, and Beatrix from IX are all pretty strong female characters, although Beatrix is a bit of a villain.  This isn't something I've thought too much about so I can't give the best answer.  But those are my top of my head choices.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Jun-17 09:08 AM;"FF is a pretty mainstream JRPG.  So just about any game within that genre would probably feel similar.  This is another one where I can't really answer.  My JRPG resume consists of FF, KH, Persona, and Pokemon so I can't really pitch you anything.  I've heard good things about the Tales of series, but I don't know how similar it is to FF";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Jun-17 09:12 AM;"Fundamental element of FF would have to be the stories and characters.  You could argue that the ATB (Active Time Battle (the combat system)) is pretty fundamental as well but 7/15 main series titles don't use it.  All of the games, with a couple exceptions in the early NES titles, have a heavy emphasis on story and characters though so if I had to pick something to say is the most important aspect of the series that's what I'd go with.";;

Lukas_Skywalkerr#0481;18-Jun-17 07:46 PM;"Hi. I own Ff7, x and x2 (think that what's its called ) and ff15. I have never played an Ff game or any game like Ff. I wanted to play them but don't know what one to start with, does it matter ?";;
Hashel#2987;18-Jun-17 07:48 PM;They have no plot connection between them;;
Hashel#2987;18-Jun-17 07:48 PM;gameplay is different in (almost) every game in the series;;
Hashel#2987;18-Jun-17 07:49 PM;i'd say start with the oldest ?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 08:00 PM;"7 if you can bare the dated visuals and old-ish combat system, 10 is more modern but a lot more linear in that regard, 10-2 is similar but the story is very weak, 15 has virtually no story but overall the most modernized game of the bunch. It is open world and includes a lot of fetch quests up until the second half of the game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 08:01 PM;whichever one fits your playstyle I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 08:01 PM;if you still can't choose just go with 10 by default;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Jun-17 08:32 PM;"X is a good starting point for the series in general.   That would be my pick.   X-2 is alright but very different from X which turns a lot of people off.  VII is good if, like stated earlier, you can handle the dated graphics and game design.  XV is alright.  I enjoyed it but it definitely suffers from a game that was rushed and had a ton of content cut and not properly done.";;
pokemongenius#1474;18-Jun-17 08:53 PM;"Id pick FF4, FF6, or FF7";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Jun-17 09:09 PM;"I'd not pick FF6 as your first actually, if only because it's probably the best of the 2D games, so it sets up overly-high expectations";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Jun-17 09:12 PM;yes I know I was just responding to @pokemongenius#1474 as a generality;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Jun-17 09:12 PM;"for this scenario I'll recommend VII but I'm unable to sympathize with being unable to handle older games, so X might be better";;

viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:29 PM;major numerus's radis command does 20k dmg when you put battles into 5 stars in all my playthroughs;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:30 PM;i honestly have no idea where the idea it gets easier every playthrough came from;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:30 PM;"maybe there's some discussion on the wiki page, idk";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:30 PM;Makes sense. Looks like my second thought was spot on. Assuming you really didnt notice any differences im now 100% confident the writer meant to say Speed is essential to the fight. They couldve also meant how much time youve spent helps in terms of grinding;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:32 PM;i think so;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:32 PM;"but that's kinda half right, i think luck is the biggest factor 😄";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:33 PM;I lack hard evidence sadly so im stuck theorizing. Hey if you win isnt that all that matters in the end?;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:33 PM;"yeah to me, but the point of wiki pages is to help people, not provide wrong or confusing info";;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:34 PM;not sure exactly what the freshest mechanics from the game's playtime is lol;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:34 PM;I dont think that was intentional personally but again theory;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:34 PM;"yeah maybe, but it makes absolutely no sense";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:35 PM;You know what else makes no sense? Why a linear game would suddenly become open world at the last act;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:36 PM;"that's like, every ff ever isn't it";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:36 PM;No;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:37 PM;You get to at least explore more in previous entries;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:37 PM;12 is all about that;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:37 PM;depends on your definition of open world;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:38 PM;"they're all pretty close to open worlds from the start, with certain areas locked off";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:38 PM;Yes locked off but you can at least explore and even get beat down. 13 its drive straight wooo;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:39 PM;"true, but no one ever said 13 is open world 😃";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:39 PM;Until last act;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:40 PM;it's like a big dungeon that takes place outside;;

pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:41 PM;Its the most open area though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:41 PM;or Titan's trials;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:45 PM;in some cases Dark Souls can be considered one as well but that depends entirely on how you look at it so not entirely open world;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:46 PM;so open world is subjective;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:46 PM;for Souls games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:46 PM;since they aren't technically designed like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:47 PM;but due to how areas connect some people group them in that genre anyway;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:47 PM;was ff7 open world? i never played it;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:48 PM;Its fairly big. It opens up after the Tutorial;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:48 PM;aka the first 3 hours;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:48 PM;after that is;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:48 PM;though jrpgs definition of OW tends to be;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:49 PM;you have an overworld map;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:49 PM;you run to different areas;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:49 PM;"towns, dungeons w/e";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:49 PM;that's a trait a lot of jrpgs share in general though;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:50 PM;Its only when your prevented from exploring said world its linear;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:51 PM;Story over exploration is the way i take it. FFX handled this wonderfully though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:52 PM;I don't have a particular preference on either;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:52 PM;though;;
viology#4617;28-Jun-17 09:52 PM;"ff12 is like no story, all exploration :S";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:52 PM;there should be no such thing as story and exploration being on two different spectrums;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:52 PM;what version of FF12 are you playing lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:53 PM;a tech demo?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:53 PM;but anyway as I was saying;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:53 PM;I like the freedom to just goof around while Meteor is hurdling down. No seriously guys i'll save the planet...after one more snowboard ride;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:54 PM;they should be able to compliment each other;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:54 PM;this is FFXV's problem in a nutshell;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:54 PM;so open world to the point that the story is now irrelevant;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:55 PM;and then the last 1/3 is goes linear;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Jun-17 09:55 PM;and rushes everything with a 4 hour dungeon;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 09:57 PM;Eww;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Jun-17 10:04 PM;Did FF12 Revenant Wings even have a story i seem to recall it just being Fire Emblem but with minimal dialog;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:48 AM;can i do the optional ff1 dungeons after completing the game?;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:49 AM;not sure if they are worth my time right now;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:50 AM;You SHOULD NOT go in there until your strong enough you will get creamed. However there is a plus side to going in early you get rare and powerful gear;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:50 AM;that wasn't my question though...;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:50 AM;Oh sorry yes you can;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:51 AM;"awesome, thanks";;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:51 AM;"btw, my party is level 50, i'm almost sure they wouldn't be hard";;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:51 AM;the game is pretty easy so far;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:51 AM;Water Shrine will say otherwise 👀;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:52 AM;40 floors just seem like a grind;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:52 AM;more content is not always better;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:52 AM;Like the Dancer room? Aka Troll Central;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:53 AM;what dancer room?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:53 AM;In the wind dungeon;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:53 AM;haven't been there yet;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:54 AM;i might go back to finish the optional dungeons after finishing the ff series;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:54 AM;Or how bout the forced encounter spaces and npc trolling. Omg the npc trolling is unbearable;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:55 AM;The Earth Shrine is the only reasonable extra dungeon;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:56 AM;that desert made me rage quit after 1 minute;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:56 AM;"ok, not a rage quit, but i'm just not in the mood";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:57 AM;The desert room is easy!;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:57 AM;"oh, the chaos shrine optional dungeon can also be done post ending?";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:57 AM;Theres a 5th optioal dungeon!? Whaaaat?;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 10:58 AM;"not sure if I can post this here, could be a spoiler";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Jun-17 10:59 AM;Post in spoilers;;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 11:48 PM;"@pokemongenius#1474 you were wrong, you CAN'T finish the optional dungeons after finishing FF1. after credits, you only have the option to start a new game but keeping your bestiary intact";;
Marcello#4574;29-Jun-17 11:49 PM;i'm glad i made a backup save though;;
pokemongenius#1474;30-Jun-17 08:47 AM;Oh really? I thought i recall doing it. Or maybe i saved over another file. Sorry bout the incorrect response;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 09:03 AM;"odd, could have sworn FF1 had a Clear Save";;
pokemongenius#1474;30-Jun-17 09:14 AM;It does in DoS i know you get a gold star after completion;;
Marcello#4574;30-Jun-17 09:21 AM;@mrmiffmiff#0666 It does. But clear save means starting over only keeping your bestiary;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 09:25 AM;that's dumb;;
Marcello#4574;30-Jun-17 10:42 AM;"@mrmiffmiff#0666 to a lore point of view, it wouldn't make sense to continue, since they fixed REDACTED";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 10:44 AM;yeah but there are other FF games with post-games that don't make sense in context;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 10:44 AM;the entire point of a post-game is that it's more or less purely gameplay and not canon;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 10:44 AM;with some exceptions;;
Marcello#4574;30-Jun-17 10:45 AM;"sure, but square enix have been inconsistent since ff1";;
Marcello#4574;30-Jun-17 10:47 AM;"sure it would be better, but there wasn't anything left to do in the original version";;
pokemongenius#1474;30-Jun-17 12:02 PM;No more extra dungeons four was enough;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Jun-17 12:31 PM;The game itself was enough;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 12:48 PM;tbh garland was enough for some people;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 12:48 PM;legit there are some people who thought saving the princess was the end of the game back in the day;;
pokemongenius#1474;30-Jun-17 12:48 PM;Since DoS includes FF2 the extra content is mostly unecessary;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 12:49 PM;many people were unused to games that were of any significant length;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;30-Jun-17 12:49 PM;so when they got to what they assumed was the end they just turned it off;;
pokemongenius#1474;30-Jun-17 12:50 PM;You thought you reached the end but it was me the tutorial!;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Jun-17 12:52 PM;FF2 itself is unecessary content;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:01 PM;the only thing I found hard was how poorly balanced it was;;

pokemongenius#1474;01-Jul-17 09:01 PM;Ff8 is hard when you dont understand Junction;;

pokemongenius#1474;01-Jul-17 09:02 PM;I like FF8;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:02 PM;but yeah I hope they learn to add more challenge to their games in the future;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:02 PM;or atleast add difficulty modes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:03 PM;with more options than just easy or normal;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Jul-17 09:03 PM;Well most games now have been on a make it easier for everyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:04 PM;easier for everyone doesn't exactly mean it is fun for everyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:05 PM;I think XV is probably one of the best examples with how much they try to cater to people who must be absolutely braindead;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Jul-17 09:05 PM;The difficulty mods made for these games really highlight how broken each was once you learned it;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Jul-17 09:06 PM;Like FF8's forces you to use Junction the intended way and you still can lose. Thats a good difficulty;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Jul-17 09:07 PM;they need to let atlus handle difficulty balancing;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;09-Jul-17 09:28 PM;And a lot of the better parts of it.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;09-Jul-17 09:28 PM;The game was super ambitious and had a bunch of stuff going for it.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;09-Jul-17 09:28 PM;Just poorly executed.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;09-Jul-17 09:30 PM;"Really, really, poorly executed.";;
Marcello#4574;10-Jul-17 12:27 AM;i think i watched jared's video on ff2;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jul-17 12:27 AM;"but still, i'm willing to try it because i want to play the whole series in order";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 08:58 AM;"ff2's not bad in my view, the only truly bad mainline FF is 3";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 08:58 AM;plus it's basically Star Wars which raises its worth in my book;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:04 AM;I enjoyed 3.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:04 AM;I would argue XIII is the only truly awful game in the franchise.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:05 AM;"When characters written on an SNES  game released nearly 20 years prior are more interesting and emotional investing than present day, you fucked up.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:07 AM;I mean there are people who enjoyed XIII so I guess ultimately it's subjective.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:08 AM;Those people are WRONG! 😛;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:08 AM;"I can't enjoy 3. The characters really aren't interesting, didn't even have personalities in the original version, and the gameplay is bad.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:08 AM;"The character development system is by far the worst in the series, even worse than 2's.";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:08 AM;The gameplay is an improved version of 1. Removing some of the uncessary bloat from 2.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:08 AM;3's implementation of jobs is just annoying.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:09 AM;"I played them in order of release, so I enjoyed III for what it was.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:09 AM;The game clearly tries to encourage using new jobs when you get them but the gameplay itself penalizes you for doing so.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:10 AM;"Not if you grind, which is what you have to do in the first three games.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:11 AM;"I mean, I understand that, but the degree to which you have to is a bit unacceptable., , I also dislike grinding for anything that isn't either levels or money. 2's skills being an exception since that's their substitute for levels.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:11 AM;It'd be more acceptable if jobs didn't gain levels at an annoyingly slow rate.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:11 AM;"Like, based on actions per battle? Seriously?";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:12 AM;But what about VIII where you are actually rewarded for NOT leveling?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:12 AM;different issue;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:12 AM;Just give a base amount for enemies beaten like with exp and be done with it.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:12 AM;"Junction, don't level, breeze through the first two discs with 3000 HP by level 5.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:13 AM;"Why are you making this about VIII? I acknowledge VIII's system is flawed too, but that's not what the conversation was about.";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:13 AM;"If they were to try such game design now, I would agree with all your points. However, I also look at the time it was released. Before the NES, we had the Odyssey and Atari consoles, which promoted... rudimentary game design to say the least.";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:13 AM;"I was making a joke, as you mentioned the issue with leveling.";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:13 AM;Wasn't to be taken seriously. I enjoy VIII;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:14 AM;aye alright sorry;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:14 AM;I see the NES era as a testing ground for various different RPG and general game design mechanics.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:14 AM;"What worked, what didn't work.";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:14 AM;So I don't judge 1-3 as harshly as some.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:14 AM;"ehhhhh, the thing is, it's not as if they were the first RPGs in general";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:15 AM;"even if we discount tabletop, we have games like Ultima and Wizardry to already show what could or couldn't work";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:15 AM;I don't mind a bit of experimentation;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:15 AM;but like;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:15 AM;"They weren't, but for consoles we still didn't have much. We had Wizardy and Ultima on PC, which were SUPER archaic (even though Ultima IV is one of my favorite games of all time), but console development had to stream line certain elements from those PC title.s";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:15 AM;at least fucking play your game before releasing it;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:15 AM;"For example, the word system in FF2 was similar to how you had to find and talk to certain NPCs in the early Ultima titles.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;>.> which early Ultima titles?;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;The magic system in 1 and 3 were taken wholesale from D&D;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;"Akalabeth, Ultima 1, and Ultima 2 didn't have that";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;"Ultima IV, V, and I think VI. Been a while since I played VI.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;ah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;alright;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;"Could be mistaken, but I know Ultima IV and V had it.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;I wouldn't consider those early titles;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:16 AM;I'd consider those... middle era titles...;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:17 AM;"For RPGs, I would.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:17 AM;"Early RPGs, sure";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:17 AM;not Early Ultima titles;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:17 AM;Released two years before the first Final Fantasy game.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:17 AM;"`The magic system in 1 and 3 were taken wholesale from D&D`, , real talk part of me still wishes it was a thing";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:18 AM;I play Pathfinder so spell slots are still a thing I love;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:18 AM;"I don't. While it works for a pen and paper RPG, it didn't make playing it in a digital format as fun.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:18 AM;far more strategic;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:18 AM;"or tactical, rather";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:19 AM;"Personally, I think that having a resource you can pool all your spells from (MP or SP) to be better for video games and focus on using magic to attack weakness of certain enemies.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:19 AM;it's funny you say that because I low-key hate AD&D and can't play Baldur's Gate because of that;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:19 AM;The Shin Megami Tensei/Persona games do this perfectly.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:19 AM;I say low-key but I actually mean high-key;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:20 AM;...really not a fan of THAC0;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:20 AM;No they dont claus;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:20 AM;Certainly not Persona;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:20 AM;though ironically enough TES: Arena and TES: Daggerfall's pseudo-THAC0 are fine in my book;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:20 AM;Which often focuses on SP abuse leaving you starved half of the time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:21 AM;Not to mention how rare SP restoring consumables are;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:22 AM;I have never had issues with managing SP.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:23 AM;And I usually play on Hard for a first playthrough if possible.;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:23 AM;Do you just spam the AoE high level spells over the cheaper single/lower level aoe spells?;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:23 AM;Do you alternate between characters to spread out the SP usage?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:25 AM;Yes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:26 AM;The primary way of avoiding it is to just not use them often which draws out fights;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:27 AM;Which is where the problem really stems from;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:30 AM;"I think that is a good balance. You can get through any fight with minimal damage/SP drain, but take longer or wipe out an enemy with a strong spell and waste a lot of SP, leading to more damage later into the dungeon.";;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:30 AM;I like it.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;10-Jul-17 09:35 AM;that kind of seems like a fake sort of balance;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:37 AM;Fake? How is it any different than having say 10 spells you can do in total until you sleep/rest at an inn?;;
Luka#9894;10-Jul-17 09:39 AM;"Still limits the amount of magic you can do, giving you alternate ways and forces you to make a choice and strategize.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:47 AM;I dont find it balanced especially in the later games for the Persona side of SMT;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Jul-17 09:47 AM;Which rewards and encourages you to spend SP a lot;;

Hardin#0379;12-Jul-17 09:47 PM;I have heard that the PS2 can cause some PS1 games to not have 100% accurate colors to the original game vs playing on a PS1. Does anyone know how accurate this is? Is there a list of affected games? I heard it from my life in gaming's video on the PS1.;;
Seymour#0747;12-Jul-17 10:44 PM;Can you pause CG cutscnes in FFX Steam?;;
shylax#4705;13-Jul-17 12:38 AM;is there any easy way to deal with the unescapable encounters in Lunar Subterranean?;;
shylax#4705;13-Jul-17 12:38 AM;because that's bullshit;;
shylax#4705;13-Jul-17 12:38 AM;(FF4A);;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:09 AM;"hey, I am totally new to FF and just got FF12TZA and had some questions if that is ok 😃";;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:10 AM;So in battle is there any point in running around to avoid attacks or is it pointless as block/dodge is all stats based?;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:11 AM;"If you get an enemy locked onto you, you can kite it around whilst your other characters attack it";;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:11 AM;But it'll probably change targets soon;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:12 AM;ok so if an enemy targets me (red line) then moving does nothing to avoid an attack hitting?;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:12 AM;"If they do hit you, I believe it does nothing to help yeah";;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:12 AM;Since it goes on your evade stats and stuff;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:12 AM;"cool, kinda odd as it feels like moving would help avoid an attack ha";;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;I still do it regardless cause it's boring just sitting there attacking :p;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;Yeah I agree;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;With this license points stuff does it mean I need a license to use a certain weapon?;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;I think for some cone attacks you can avoid them by running around;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;But they're rare;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;Like if I buy something I can't use it without a license for it?;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;Ye you basically learn how to use them;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:13 AM;ok;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:14 AM;Same for magic and stuff;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:14 AM;"Is there any kind of active quest log like in Skyrim, Witcher, etc?";;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:14 AM;Sometimes I feel kind of lost trying to remember what I have to do.;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:15 AM;I know there is that little note it shows you on the map screen but just wondered if there was some kind of real log of things?;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:15 AM;"I don't think so, I can't recall something like that for the main storyline";;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:16 AM;"As you said, it's just really that little bit on the map";;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:16 AM;Ff games usually don't tell you exactly where to go all the time;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:16 AM;They drop it in conversations and stuff;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:17 AM;Ff7 was the worst for that kind of stuff;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:18 AM;If you missed it in the conversation;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:18 AM;You're boned if you don't know where to go;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:22 AM;hmm;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:34 AM;So I have to pick a job for Vaan (and other party members when I get them) and that lays out the things I can and cant learn?;;
satysin#8578;13-Jul-17 04:34 AM;I think I will restart the game as I had no clue wtf I was doing and just picked Time Battlemage randomly lol;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:45 AM;You can pick a second job later on in the game;;
Triston#0116;13-Jul-17 04:45 AM;So you're not totally boned;;
Benag#5601;13-Jul-17 10:22 AM;Ugh I screwed up and had firefly on Fran and now she is four levels behind. Should I grind to get her back up or should I sideline her? I'm on the leviathan.;;
Benag#5601;13-Jul-17 10:48 AM;Never mind;;
Aruu#2066;13-Jul-17 10:49 AM;Sorry! FFXII is the one game I have no idea about;;
Benag#5601;13-Jul-17 11:05 AM;No it's fine I figured it out myself;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Jul-17 11:26 AM;"In the original game you'd probably be fine sidelining her, but in TZA where everyone specializes with the jobs I'd say grind her back up";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jul-17 11:28 AM;"I don't think 4 levels is that far behind,  if you just use her like normal the levels will eventually even out again";;
Strongest Hero#8100;13-Jul-17 11:37 AM;"Hello, I decided to play FF1 through the Origins version, and I'm trying to decide which options to enable as Quality of Life without reducing the original game's difficulty. There's one, for example, that lets me disable the use of Life1 Life2 Stona and Gold Needles in battle. Was that the case in the NES game?";;
alp#3140;13-Jul-17 11:59 AM;@satysin#8578 as for jobs in FF12 there's no real wrong setups;;
alp#3140;13-Jul-17 11:59 AM;ofc some setups are better than others but you can't really go wrong with any of them;;
alp#3140;13-Jul-17 11:59 AM;"and, as someone else said earlier, all of your characters get two jobs";;
alp#3140;13-Jul-17 12:00 PM;"since you get 12 jobs, 6 main party members, and 2 jobs per character you might be tempted to use all of them but just remember that you can have more than 1 character of the same job";;
Lto#1172;13-Jul-17 12:01 PM;also some characters are better with certain jobs than others.;;
alp#3140;13-Jul-17 12:12 PM;yeah true;;
Lto#1172;13-Jul-17 12:19 PM;only a madmen would put Basch as a Blackmage;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 12:42 PM;"@Strongest Hero#8100 In the original NES version of FF1 there were a lot of spells that were just broken, as in didn't work, I'm not super familiar with being able to disable spells or anything, I played through FF1 and FF2 origins on PSP but didn't change any of the settings around myself. But reading guides and walkthroughs for it (because I haven't played the NES version since I was five) but the walkthroughs from what I remember mention a lot of the spells you should skip buying because they didn't work in the game.";;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 12:44 PM;Having that knowledge ahead of time if I ever did decide to play the NES version on like an emulator or something I would look up exactly what spells were broken so I wouldn't bother purchasing them and trying to use them. It really feels like the NES FF1 was a beta/early access launch lol since it has multiple items/spells that don't work as intended.;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 12:45 PM;As far as I remember from my FF1/FF2 Origins PSP playthroughs a couple years ago (when r/ff did the year of final fantasy where we played through every main series FF in a year) all the spells in Orgins work just fine but maybe someone else with more knowledge of Origins can chime in here?;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 12:45 PM;I hope I answered your question lol sorry if I wrote an essay 😛;;
Strongest Hero#8100;13-Jul-17 12:52 PM;"That's aright, I might check the PSP version out if I can make PPSSPP fast forward battles";;
Marcello#4574;13-Jul-17 12:59 PM;@Strongest Hero#8100 right trigger if you are playing with a xinput controller;;
Marcello#4574;13-Jul-17 12:59 PM;"if not, i think you will need to set the controls manually";;
Strongest Hero#8100;13-Jul-17 01:07 PM;"thanks switched to ppspp and did the tweaks, works great!";;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:11 PM;My phone can't even run PPSSPP lol;;

Marcello#4574;13-Jul-17 01:13 PM;i have to enable frameskipping so the audio doesn't glitch;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:20 PM;"I have one of those cheap Moto 4G from Amazon for like $100 so even if I can get a game to run on it, I'm getting about 5 FPS at best lol";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jul-17 01:21 PM;just run it on pc;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:22 PM;well yeah but there's no portability there 😛;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:22 PM;And I have a PS Vita but I don't really feel like modding it to run ROMs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jul-17 01:22 PM;i'm talking about PPSSPP;;

Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:24 PM;I put POGO on one but they are absolutely trash;;
Luka#9894;13-Jul-17 01:24 PM;You can play Final Fantasy I-X/X-2;;

Marcello#4574;13-Jul-17 01:32 PM;you can buy most ff games on play store too;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:36 PM;yeah I own them;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:36 PM;the problem is that I like playing things like FFT1.3;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:36 PM;which you need ppsspp for because you can't mod your legit copy of FFT;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:36 PM;unless you mod your vita;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:36 PM;but when you own a ton of games on your vita it gets a little more complicated to mod it;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:36 PM;and swap back and forth;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 01:37 PM;We should just move on to a different discussion lol;;
Murlo#8015;13-Jul-17 02:04 PM;not sure why i posted this in spoilers;;
Murlo#8015;13-Jul-17 02:04 PM;anyhow;;
Murlo#8015;13-Jul-17 02:04 PM;"anyone got the new ff xii remaster book guide?, is it good?, if it is good, where to buy it?";;

Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 02:31 PM;There are bluetooth controllers you can pair with your phone if you don't like the controls on the screen;;
Darinair#8724;13-Jul-17 02:31 PM;I was the exact same way so getting a blue tooth controller set up was the only thing that got me playing games on my phone lol;;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 12:40 AM;"Quick question - I just got Balthier in FFXII. I'm planning to roll him as WHM/MCH, but which would be best first? Should I set as WHM for early healing, or MCH as he has some nodes unlocked already?";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 12:58 AM;could do mch since fran has cure already unlocked so you could use her as your healer till tomb of raithwall;;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 02:07 AM;Oh awesome thanks. Just cure will be enough until then? (Never played the game before);;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 02:10 AM;(Sorry for a slow reply here had t noticed the message D:);;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:23 AM;"Yeah more or less, you can switch to hi potions when it doesn't heal enough anymore";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:26 AM;Half of the time you'll be with a guest who throws hi potions out like rubbish;;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 02:27 AM;Oh awesome. Would I need to Gil farm or anything?;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:27 AM;You can do in the lhusu mines I believe it is in bhujerba but it's not too too necessary;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:28 AM;"But obviously if you've passed that point, that won't be available to you";;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 02:29 AM;I'm still in the sewers after picking up Fran and Balthier at the moment;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:30 AM;"Ahh okay, quite early on then. Yeah I don't think you'll have to do too much grinding for gil to get potions";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:30 AM;The next area after the sewers gives some decent loot and Gil in chests;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:31 AM;"And then you can grind at the Lhusu mines if needed but other than that, you should be fine";;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 02:33 AM;Oh awesome. That's true in Zodiac Age as well? I felt like I read somewhere something about Hi-Potions changed.;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:35 AM;"Ahh I can't comment on that yet, I'm only a little bit further than you. Just going on what I knew from the original :p";;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 02:43 AM;@Triston#0116 Ah fair enough. Here's hoping lol. Thanks again.;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 02:46 AM;"No problem mate, good luck!";;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 03:38 AM;@Triston#0116 Sorry to ask again but - will I get the whole party back before I get the second job? (Ashe and Pen specifically?);;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 03:58 AM;Yeah pretty sure you get your whole party before the second job @Shirayuri#4328;;
Shirayuri#4328;14-Jul-17 03:58 AM;Phew thanks 💃;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 03:59 AM;"Basically, it's after bhujerba which is after the next area after the sewers";;
Murlo#8015;14-Jul-17 08:14 AM;Ranged weapons in FF xii;;
Murlo#8015;14-Jul-17 08:14 AM;"wich is better, bow, crossbows or guns?";;
Murlo#8015;14-Jul-17 08:14 AM;are they all viable?;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:25 AM;Yeah more or less;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:26 AM;"I only have the non-IZJS version for the PS2, but Guns are good until later on";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:26 AM;"Guns are pretty bad once you pass a certain point but early on yeah, they're decent";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:27 AM;Unless you get the seitengrate then you're pretty much done;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:29 AM;I wonder if the seitengrate is actually available on zodiac age;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:29 AM;Seitengrate? Is that a weapon in IZJS?;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:29 AM;It's the super broken 220~ power bow;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:30 AM;That makes you invisible and has 20 range;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:30 AM;It cant combo though since its a bow right?;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:31 AM;"unless the damage limit is broken of course, I dont know much about other versions of ffxii";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:32 AM;Yeah there's no cap on zodiac age so it's like super broken;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:32 AM;You can hit hundreds of thousands;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:33 AM;Ah so the Masamune + GG isnt the best thing anymore then;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:33 AM;Well it's still pretty viable;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:34 AM;Combo'ing 9 times is still good;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:34 AM;"Im not sure if I want to get a 2nd masamune on my file, im working on the Tournesol so I can make it easier";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:34 AM;I screwed up the zodiac spear already;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:35 AM;But the lack of another genji glove will make it weaker;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:35 AM;How'd you screw it up?;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:35 AM;Opening a forbidden treasure;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:35 AM;In Zodiac age?;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:36 AM;The ps2 version;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:36 AM;Ahh right gotcha;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:36 AM;Ye there's none of that in zodiac age thankfully haha;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:36 AM;No need to worry about not opening some treasures;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:37 AM;"Im having a lot of trouble with Hell Gates Flames though, been killing Cerebus'es for hours and I still have 0";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:38 AM;Are you poaching them;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:39 AM;"Nope, killing them";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:40 AM;"I guess im just unlucky, it was really easy for me to get all the serpent eyes and i've heard some have massive trouble with those";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:44 AM;You need to poach them apparently;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:45 AM;I'll try that;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:45 AM;Will be hard with 5% poach chance;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:51 AM;"I don't remember all this, it was years since I played ff12 tbh :p";;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:51 AM;I remember getting high arcanas was a right pain in the ass;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:52 AM;Yea they require soul of thamasas;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:52 AM;I remember there was a kind of glitch when using them to get bazaar stuff;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:53 AM;Selling stuff to unlock 2 weapons at once?;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:53 AM;Basically the game treats the item as a whole thing so you could sell a bunch of items and get 2 of the things you needed whilst only have the ingredients for 1;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:53 AM;Yee;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:53 AM;I did that a lot;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:53 AM;Im planning to do that to get a 2nd masamune + the tournesol;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:54 AM;Im not sure if I want to go with a 2nd Masamune or use the Orochi I spent 3 hours getting;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:55 AM;Get it all :p;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:56 AM;Switch when you get bored of the masamune :p;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 08:57 AM;I could get a Yagyu darkblade instead of the Orochi but its a painful grind;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:58 AM;3% drop rate isn't it;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 08:58 AM;Fk that;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 09:00 AM;from a rare game you need to chain that appears right next to 2 enemies that break the chain;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 09:01 AM;Lmao;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 09:01 AM;Sounds terrible;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 09:03 AM;Ff12 has to be the most time consuming ff;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 09:03 AM;140 hours and my highest level character is level 76 and i've completed half of the hunts;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 09:06 AM;and the only superboss i've killed is the Ultima esper;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 09:27 AM;Yeah absolutely. I 100%'d ff7 in 56~ hrs and ff12 is like triple that time gaha;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 09:27 AM;Haha;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 04:59 PM;damn I thought things would be easier after I got the 6 Hell Gate Flames;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 05:00 PM;Now I need 6 wargod bands from the leynirs and they are even harder to get;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 05:00 PM;lmao;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 05:00 PM;no luck;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 05:00 PM;"I have everything for 3x gemsteel and 1 masamune though, only need 3x Serpentarius and 3x Empyreal now";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 05:01 PM;so much soft resetting;;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 05:03 PM;"So I need 1 more high arcana, 6 wargod bands, I think 12 serpent skins and a few of the last item for Empyreal";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 05:04 PM;wow just got a wargods band im lucky;;
Triston#0116;14-Jul-17 05:05 PM;it sounds like a lot of work :p;;

Prothvar#0896;14-Jul-17 05:57 PM;"So, got a FFX HD question, with the Sphere Grid (don't worry, not which one question!)  probably be easier to take the 'Extract Sphere' Abilities early on, at least the mana and Ability ones?";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 06:21 PM;"You will only use them a little during the beginning of the game, and chances are you wont use them at all";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 06:22 PM;"In sone shops, I dont remember when they become available but you can buy Sphere Distillers that do the same thing";;
Sclipzer#0168;14-Jul-17 06:22 PM;And during the game you will find weapons that has the abilities built in;;
Prothvar#0896;14-Jul-17 06:25 PM;"Yeah, got the Strength one for Tidus, the one i was mainyl curious about was Ability, any recommendations for MUST skills? if any";;

Triston#0116;15-Jul-17 01:47 AM;@Prothvar#0896 sorry I'm late and this is probably irrelevant now but make sure you get extract ability because you only get like 3 ability spheres for a long time;;

Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:07 AM;What level do I need to hit for 9999 dmg with the Tournesol? I put it on Basch who is level 77 and he hits for around 6000-7000dmg and with Bravery he does closer to 8000;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:07 AM;And my 2 masamune users deal 4000-5000 damage;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:08 AM;"Ps2, not TZA";;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:09 AM;I could try putting it on Ashe who is level 85 but it would still probably not deal 9999 dmg;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:10 AM;how are people lv 77 already 😫;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:10 AM;"Its not the new version, old ps2 one";;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:11 AM;"yeah, but i assume you started playing recently";;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:11 AM;"I've had it for around 1,5 years now, havent played that much because the tournesol grind is such a pain";;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:12 AM;so not that recent lol;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:12 AM;"Just defeated Hell Wyrm today, will level up until I can hit for 9999 then ill go after Omega Mark";;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:13 AM;i don't think you can consistently hit for max dmg;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:13 AM;especially against elite marks;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:13 AM;"I've hit for it a few times using the Golden Axe, but they deal completely random damage";;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:14 AM;I could actually hit for 8000 damage with the Masamune when Hell Wyrm got me to critical health;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:15 AM;maybe play around that;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:16 AM;"The strategy for the end game bosses is pretty much just 1 tank, 2 critical health Masamune attackers anyway so I just need to get that up a little higher";;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:19 AM;Well Yiazmat reduces the cap to 6999 damage anyway;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:19 AM;really;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:19 AM;i swear i saw a video where someone was doing ~30k;;

viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:21 AM;yeah it was the strategy you said;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:21 AM;a tank + masamune;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:21 AM;ah ok;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:21 AM;i checked the wiki;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:21 AM;"When his HP drops below 50% all attacks against Yiazmat are capped at 6,999 damage";;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:22 AM;so after a while it kicks in;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:23 AM;Tournesol will be wasting damage and not comboing with the 6999 cap;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:23 AM;I might even go get a 3rd masamune for Yiazmat;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:23 AM;that's why you use samurai swords isn't it;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:24 AM;rather get lots of attacks that do less if you can't do that much dmg anyway;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:24 AM;"Yea, not sure what works best as an accessory though";;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:24 AM;Theres only 1 genji glove in the game;;

viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:26 AM;"i would do bubble belt, but haven't played for like 10 years lol";;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:27 AM;wait is this for omega mark or yiazmat;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:27 AM;Both;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:28 AM;is cat ear hood even good in zodiac versions?;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:29 AM;Well Omega puts you in berserk and Yiazmat has a really high proc chance Death attack but ribbon wont do that much;;
viology#4617;15-Jul-17 08:30 AM;yeah bubble belt looking better and better;;
Sclipzer#0168;15-Jul-17 08:40 AM;Bubble belt is also really good for recocering if something goes wrong and you'll have more hp and time for reviving;;

Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 09:52 PM;Decent AoE magic attack for a healer.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 09:57 PM;Death in FF13 is one of the only viable strats for turtle killing.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 09:58 PM;And it's a decent way to break damage cap if you don't have Genji.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:59 PM;to be fair death in FF13 compensates a failed attempt with damage;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:59 PM;not really the same as the other games where it either works or it doesn't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:59 PM;I'd say that stuff like that doesn't have that much use in FF in general;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 10:06 PM;it isn't concsistent like normal elemental spells;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 10:06 PM;But decent for farming at low levels.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 10:06 PM;Just keep a save.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 10:07 PM;"success rate is low, and pretty much any enemy that the spell would be useful for probably resists it anyway";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 10:07 PM;and there's this general situation of there being a million other abilities that outclass it in some way;;

ClawViper#4825;17-Jul-17 01:31 PM;Think of the gameplay as a single player MMO where you can configure the AI of your party members;;
ClawViper#4825;17-Jul-17 01:32 PM;But if you prefer a much more character-focused/plot-focused game then it's probably better to pass on it;;
Claudia#8474;17-Jul-17 04:06 PM;"XII I find to be an excellent idea mired by producer meddling. If you can look past Vaan and the issues early on, you can find a pretty excellent story and (much improved thanks to TZA) gameplay similar to that of most Western RPGs nowadays (Hunts, Quests, exploring a large world).";;

majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 06:21 PM;"I'm new to the discord, can you ask game specific questions? I was gonna ask for some help with picking classes in FF12";;
Benag#5601;17-Jul-17 06:32 PM;Yes;;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 06:44 PM;"I cant decide what to give Balthier and Penelo for their second classes, right now Balthier is a shikari and penelo is a white mage. I was thinking Shikari/Foebreaker for Balthier, and White Mage/Machinist for penelo?";;
Hayden#8054;17-Jul-17 08:08 PM;@majorasnightmare#1354  im running with that right now. My current crew is (Vaan-Bushi/Monk)(Balthier-Shikari/Foebreaker)(Basch-Archer/Uhlan)(Ashe-Knight/TimeBattlemage)(Fran-BlackMage/RedBattlemage) and (Penelo-WhiteMage/Machinest) but the white mage staves so far still seem better than the guns much higher damage from equip its just hard to see why to run her with the guns themselves;;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:11 PM;"i mainly wanted WhiteMage/Machinist to help boost her health and abilities, plus giving her tournesol in late game would help chip away at enemies with ridiculous health";;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:11 PM;thanks for answering btw!;;
Hayden#8054;17-Jul-17 08:12 PM;"no prob, tbh im still not really happy with my setup but it works well. TBH the job system is what im iffy about with this game. I actually prefered when everyone could quick swap to anything you wanted them t be";;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:12 PM;"my current setup is Vaan: Shikari/Bushi, Basch: Knight/Bushi, Fran: Archer/Uhlan, and Ashe: BlackMage/Monk, so everyone can keep pumping out damage";;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:13 PM;"i like the new job system, but i miss the old one too because at least i could just give everyone curaga and go facetank a boss lmao";;
Hayden#8054;17-Jul-17 08:15 PM;mine is that it feels strange to have a  FF protag who isnt at least a bit of a redmage. Im too used to solid magic and melee options on almost all characters. I was going to go bushi redmage but i would have gotten so little damage lore that it felt like a waste;;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:16 PM;"I was considering knight/redmage or possible uhlan/redmage but the knight/bushi combo won me over, since knight has enough battle lores to help buff out bushi while also giving him more speed";;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:17 PM;the amount of times basch combos as bushi/knight so far is just insane;;
Hayden#8054;17-Jul-17 08:17 PM;"thats why i ultimately went monk/bushi, i wanted all 12 jobs and had already given ashe my knight slot but was still iffy on Fran Blkmage/monk, and Vaan rdmg/bushi so i just swapped their classes";;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:17 PM;i rly only gave vaan shikari/bushi because of that one superboss and i had war flashbacks of how long it took me to beat it on ps2;;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:19 PM;ill probably use all 12 classes next run tbh for this run i wanted to get a feel for the classes and combos;;
majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 08:20 PM;itll be easier to see which ones go better together and use all 12 once i get a feel for the majority of them;;
Hayden#8054;17-Jul-17 08:20 PM;"im not likely to run through it again for a while, maybe even a few years. Iv got other games to do after thhis so while im not planning to plat today im just trying to complete what i can while having fun";;

majorasnightmare#1354;17-Jul-17 11:42 PM;"bushi knight is a devastating combo, plenty of foebreakers means lots of stat debuffs on enemies, knight red mage is a solid combo as youll have a lot of options for damage dealing and healing, white mage+time mage is fantastic for a dedicated support, and you played rly well into each characters strengths";;

Hayden#8054;18-Jul-17 07:26 PM;"i dont think its a spoiler, and really i would say the question depends on your primary team if you have one. Do you usually have someone out with your uhlan with those spells and does it seem worth it for you to use that esper for that specific liscense";;
Lazareus#6641;18-Jul-17 07:26 PM;"True, true";;
Hayden#8054;18-Jul-17 07:27 PM;"like i put penelo as my white mage but i never really use her unless its a quick swap for buffs or constant heals, my main team usually has fran on it as a redmage so i get cura and i keep plenty of phoenix downs on team so i dont really need the extra spells";;
Lazareus#6641;18-Jul-17 07:27 PM;"Penelo is my white mage, for other healing I have Fran and Vaan through a quickening slot";;

Lazareus#6641;18-Jul-17 07:28 PM;I ask because it's either that or for Balthier since he gains another Battle Lore;;
Hayden#8054;18-Jul-17 07:30 PM;"each lore seems to be a 1 point bonus so i guess the question is, one more person who can heal in a pinch or a one point boost in your damage calculations";;
Lazareus#6641;18-Jul-17 07:31 PM;"I feel like healing should be the answer, that way I wouldn't have a dedicated healer out";;
Lazareus#6641;18-Jul-17 07:31 PM;Do the magick lores affect the calculations of healing spells?;;
Lazareus#6641;18-Jul-17 07:33 PM;Sorry if it's a dumb question haha;;
Hayden#8054;18-Jul-17 07:34 PM;"it seems like it does, its a tough question actually. I cant find a source that it does for 12 but in 13 and 9 atleast it does infact affect your healing output so its probably a safe bet";;

Hayden#8054;19-Jul-17 03:26 AM;"@Lazareus#6641  to an extent, though it is based upon your secondary choices. You can make both Vaan and Basche  bushi's but you can only give one of them the specific summon which would give you access to the bloodsword. There is also the fact that some characters in a purely min max sense have better stats and animations for specific jobs.";;

Lazareus#6641;19-Jul-17 03:27 AM;"So if two were, as an example: A Bushi/Black Mage. And one took the Black Magicks 1 license, the other could still get black magicks 1 as well?";;
Hayden#8054;19-Jul-17 03:29 AM;"Yes, each character gets access to a clean board and doesnt interfere with each other except in the cases of Summons which can only be given to a single character and specific summons give access to specific bonus liscenses which would otheriwise be unavaliable to that job, but could be circumvented by a second job";;

rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 12:32 PM;is there a way to autolevel while afk in ff12?;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 12:33 PM;"like, just tape down the speedmode key and leave it going?";;
Triston#0116;20-Jul-17 12:37 PM;there's an afk method int he stilshrine of miriam and the henne mines;;
Triston#0116;20-Jul-17 12:38 PM;stilshrine of miriam is with a rare mob that constantly spawns ghasts or something;;
Triston#0116;20-Jul-17 12:38 PM;just set your gambits to attack <3000hp mobs;;
Triston#0116;20-Jul-17 12:38 PM;henne mines is to do with the dividing blue jellies but you need certain classes for it so it's not available all the time;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 01:08 PM;i pmed you;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 02:26 PM;note that the stilshrine of miriam method is really slow;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 02:27 PM;"put it on a few hours, got 2 levels on my level 70 character";;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 02:27 PM;imagine how slow it is if you want level 99;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 02:27 PM;"also, Negalmuur casts Doom on you constantly, you must have some very efficient reviving gambits";;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 02:27 PM;and Decoy;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 02:30 PM;otherwise your party leader will be killed and you'll get the Select a new leader popup and it will pause;;

Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 05:46 PM;"Dont think it does, could be wrong";;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 05:46 PM;"Also, is thier a point in having more than 5k hp?";;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 06:46 PM;well you cant get more than around 5.5k-6k anyway unless you use some really good Light Armor;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 06:46 PM;note that there is no actual HP Cap though;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 06:46 PM;"so even if Bubble shows 9999, you will have more";;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 06:47 PM;try using a spell that deals little damage on yourself;;
Sclipzer#0168;20-Jul-17 06:47 PM;or Sap;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:29 PM;True true;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:29 PM;Also is shades of black any good?;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:30 PM;"as far as im aware, you pretty much want to use it if you want a normally technik heavy character to use black spells for some reason";;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:30 PM;"not to mention, techniks dont use as much mp, if at all iirc";;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:31 PM;Oh so on someone mainly physical it would be of little use?;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:31 PM;i'm saying that physical characters would want shades of black if you need them to cast spells for some reason;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:31 PM;"now that i think about it, i suppose it'd be a good way to save on mp for spellcasters too";;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:32 PM;im no expert tho lol;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:33 PM;Lol;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:33 PM;Figured I'd ask cause i have unspent espers and balthier can learn it through one of them;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:36 PM;Like also asking if holy would do well on a black mage;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:38 PM;"iirc, all magic is based on the mag stat";;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:38 PM;including white magic;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:39 PM;if they have a good mag stat they'd do at least decently with any magic;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:40 PM;Oooo;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:41 PM;How useful is Hastega vs. Arise;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:43 PM;arise is like an upgraded version of raise;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:43 PM;less effective on undead tho;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:43 PM;"haste is always good, but maybe im biased from ffx, where it was the shit";;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:43 PM;hastega casts it on the whole team at once;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:44 PM;whereas arise fully heals the target;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:44 PM;Yeah;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:45 PM;so your call;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:45 PM;Its a tough choice lol;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:47 PM;do you often have problems of team members dying again after raise before they can be healed;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:47 PM;as long as you're good on healing team members immediately after raising them;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:47 PM;or if you dont really need to;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:48 PM;and if you plan on abusing haste;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:48 PM;maybe go hastega;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:48 PM;It happens if I'm fighting a tough enemy like fighting gilgemesh at a low level;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:48 PM;go with arise if you dont bother with haste tho;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:49 PM;I hardly notice the meter going any faster;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:50 PM;"apparently it increases it by 50%, and stacks with berserk";;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:50 PM;charge time;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:50 PM;"rather, it increases your charge speed i should say";;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:51 PM;Thats a good point;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 07:52 PM;Hastega seems like it would be more useful for the harder bosses;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:54 PM;it really depends on the extent to which you plan to use haste;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:54 PM;and how effective you need your raises to be;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:54 PM;imo;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:56 PM;gonna be honest tho;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:56 PM;if you expect haste to be as op as in x;;
rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 07:56 PM;you'll be sorely dissapointed;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 08:03 PM;Oh god no;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 08:03 PM;Haste in X was op;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 08:04 PM;XII I just hope it will allow me to actions out a bit quicker;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Jul-17 08:04 PM;Hastega + Quick Hit.;;

rockle#1658;20-Jul-17 08:10 PM;whats causing it;;
Seymour#0747;20-Jul-17 10:21 PM;"in FFX, does wearing something with +5% and +3% make up 8%, or does it make 15%?";;
viology#4617;20-Jul-17 10:32 PM;8%;;
viology#4617;20-Jul-17 10:35 PM;"ok in ff12 you have 6 characters, but there are 13 espers";;

Benag#5601;20-Jul-17 11:09 PM;Yes;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 11:12 PM;Yeah;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 11:12 PM;Has anyone gotten the chest in henne mines that holds the zodiac spear?;;
alp#3140;20-Jul-17 11:14 PM;"nope, I havent";;
alp#3140;20-Jul-17 11:14 PM;"also, what's better... basch as a knight/bushi and ashe as black mage/uhlan or basch as knight/uhlan and ashe as black mage/bushi?";;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 11:17 PM;YMMV but I have ashe as knight/bushi and she does well if you also unlock some of the white magicks for her;;
Lazareus#6641;20-Jul-17 11:18 PM;"I heard basch has lower magick so he might not make as good of a mage, but uhlan works on him";;
alp#3140;20-Jul-17 11:18 PM;alright;;
alp#3140;20-Jul-17 11:18 PM;I'll probably go for the first option then;;

Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:30 PM;i think one from zodiark is the only way you can properly get it;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:30 PM;1/5k from pharos subterra is a no no for me lol;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:31 PM;"1/33 from zodiark, even though there's a pain in the ass run to him, much nicer lol";;
Lazareus#6641;21-Jul-17 03:31 PM;True;;
Lazareus#6641;21-Jul-17 03:32 PM;I think I may be underleveled to fight him proper;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:32 PM;zodiark is really difficult;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:32 PM;like 10% death;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:32 PM;and a bunch of other statuses;;

Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:34 PM;he gets so tanky at <10%;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:34 PM;barely hit over 1k on him;;
Lazareus#6641;21-Jul-17 03:34 PM;What is a good level to take him on?;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:34 PM;"i remember at level 99 on the ps2 version, took me a good couple tries";;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:34 PM;ultima was a piece of cake compared to zodiark;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:34 PM;60-70+;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:35 PM;tbh i didn't have good gambits back then;;
Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 03:35 PM;since i was like 10 years old playing it;;

Lazareus#6641;21-Jul-17 03:37 PM;Damn D:;;

Triston#0116;21-Jul-17 04:58 PM;"Gendarme is pretty straight forward, trango tower is another story lol";;

Sclipzer#0168;22-Jul-17 06:06 AM;"so basically you chain something to max chain level, then you go kill something with a rare chain drop and it will be reversed, so if it's a 5% to  drop something it'll be 95%";;

Seymour#0747;24-Jul-17 10:37 AM;"Ok I feel like something is weird for me with the monster arena in FFX. I want the 99 purifying salt reward for capturing 4 of each type of dragon. I did exactly that but the monster arena guy does not give the reward, nor say anything about it. I even look at his Show me the fiends I've captured so far option and I notice it's a bunch of Unknown (0)'s. Also isn't there a fighting mechanic in the arena? I don't need it immediately but I literally don't see anywhere where I could find that. And I've been capturing a whole ton of things.";;
Triston#0116;24-Jul-17 10:47 AM;Have you captured all of the ones in the calm lands first?;;
Seymour#0747;24-Jul-17 11:00 AM;I actually just did that since I've sent my message and that was the solution......;;
Triston#0116;24-Jul-17 11:20 AM;"Good good, glad you got it all sorted. Monster arena was a right pain in the backside but you can't say no to those sweet rewards";;
Narukami#3478;24-Jul-17 01:27 PM;"What does it mean when people complain that 15 isn't Versus 13? How much was even known about Versus 13 to even have an opinion on it? I've seen the trailers and it looks similar enough to 15, just darker.";;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-17 01:29 PM;Versus had different ideas and concepts plus it was a tie in game so rip 13 fans. Its the Resident Evil 3.5 so to speak;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Jul-17 02:08 PM;"Like Code Veronica, except it didn't make it into a separate game?";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Jul-17 02:12 PM;poor management both with the team that worked on Versus and with Square as a whole led to the game being scrapped;;

pokemongenius#1474;25-Jul-17 01:43 PM;Well spoiler alert FF7 isnt that hard. Only five non super bosses should provide a challenge;;

pokemongenius#1474;25-Jul-17 01:58 PM;Aha i knew it;;
Sclipzer#0168;25-Jul-17 01:59 PM;Not sure if its worth the MP and time though;;

TAFK#2566;25-Jul-17 05:30 PM;Haha that would be so shitty;;
TAFK#2566;25-Jul-17 05:30 PM;But so good;;
Sclipzer#0168;25-Jul-17 05:32 PM;"But it's not really a strategy challenge or anything, it's more like a finger speed and thinking fast test";;

Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 08:52 PM;I guess the wait for me will be much long cause chances are i am going to wait fir all of the oarts frist;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:52 PM;that doesn't really state how many parts there will be though;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:52 PM;"I'm mostly sure it'll be 3, it'd be dumb as hell if they did hour-long parts of a 60-70 hour long game.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:52 PM;the guy said each part will be the length of one of the XIII's saga game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:53 PM;which should be expected;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:53 PM;since they will more than likely charge $60 for each installment;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:53 PM;*ech*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:53 PM;would you pay that much for a 3 to 5 hour game?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:53 PM;of course not;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:53 PM;"Well, still, my point stands.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:54 PM;Cause apparently tons of people still believe FFVII Remake will be like the The Walking Dead Series in terms of episodes.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:54 PM;that's a misinterpretation;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:54 PM;which going on the article that you posted;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:55 PM;was cleared up;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:55 PM;"Besides, like I said, it kind of makes sense. Three discs, three games. And since Square also said they would change some minor story elements and add stuff, they will probably add more sidequests and stuff to do.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:55 PM;And I say that because I kind of tried to rush Disc 1 at first.;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 08:55 PM;Yup argeed;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:56 PM;It went *bad*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:56 PM;3 discs would assume that each part would be a small segment;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:56 PM;which would go against the each part would be on par with the scale one Final Fantasy XIII game statement;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:57 PM;"How long was Final Fantasy XIII, anyway?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:57 PM;Just because the game was originally divided into multiple discs doesn't mean the remake will follow suit;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 08:57 PM;Around 40 hours i think;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:57 PM;that's literally a fault of old CDs not being able to hold the entire game;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 08:57 PM;"But tell me, please, what other way would Square do it? I just want to know, maybe I'm being dumb.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:58 PM;"They would find a part of the story and make an entire game out of it, I assume a complete experience with each part";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:59 PM;not some segmented series that leaves you waiting for the next (we would do that anyway because we know there's more to come);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:59 PM;It isn't as as simple as;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 08:59 PM;hey we had to segment the game due to hardware limitions so let's just do it like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:00 PM;They could very well redo the story so that the entire first 5 hours in the original game spans a full 40 hours or so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:01 PM;and that in itself could be a single part in this episodic format;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:01 PM;"Yeah, but if they do that, the entire FFVII Remake of the whole story will take decades.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:01 PM;you're still looking at it based on how the original game played out;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:01 PM;Because Square said they would make some MINOR changes.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:01 PM;Square says a lot of things;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:02 PM;"...well, that's true.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:02 PM;I guess I'm just used to Todd Howard being the liar in most situations.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:02 PM;obviously minor changes doesn't match with the game will be as long as a single FFXIII game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:03 PM;they have no choice but to add and remove stuff to accurately match that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:04 PM;or else we'd just be getting parts of a game and waiting forever for the next releases to come and if it were minor changes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:04 PM;then there would be no point to the episodic format anyway;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:04 PM;I see.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:05 PM;"Well, I would be lying if I said I didn't like the idea of the first five hours being expanded upon.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:05 PM;"For all the information we get about Midgar, we don't really see much of it besides the Slums and some zones of Sector 7.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:06 PM;also there could very well be some parts of Crisis Core and AC factored in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:06 PM;just something to keep in mind;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:09 PM;I would totally love to play as Zack for one segment.;;

BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:09 PM;Kinda like Chapter 13. Verse 2 on Final Fantasy XV.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:11 PM;imagine that in say 20 years from now we get FFXV Remake;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:12 PM;Please no.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:12 PM;tbh I'd say it would be the only game in the franchise that would deserve it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:12 PM;or atleast so far;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:12 PM;they have to redeem themselves somehow;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:12 PM;"I dunno, I'm pleased with XV, but I'm...kind of easy to please, so maybe it's just me.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:13 PM;Which means I'll be happy with the VII Remake.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:13 PM;...unless they remove Crossdressing Cloud.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:14 PM;I'm not really a hard to please person but I just can't look at that game and say I'm ok with how this turned out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:14 PM;not even living up to expectations because that would be even more difficult but just in general lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:15 PM;meh atleast we got WoFF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:15 PM;I take that as a 30th anniversary present given a little bit early;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:15 PM;"I'm thinking of getting it, seems like a lot of fun.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:15 PM;...except it has two things pulling me back.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:16 PM;I originally wasn't interested in it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:16 PM;as a matter of fact I wasn't following the development of the game at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:16 PM;but I remember the demo that came over the weekend before the game released;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:16 PM;at the end of the demo I had already preordered on PSN lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:17 PM;That sort of cutesy crap normally isn't my style but meh I was able to look past it for all of the other good things I saw;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:18 PM;"Oh, I'm fine with the cutesy crap.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:18 PM;"I was a huge weeb for a while, so I got used to...that.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:18 PM;"BUT, THESE LITTLE DETAILS.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:18 PM;"1: Some characters not knowing each other, which, I KNOW, IT'S TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR NEWCOMERS, but damn was it hard for me to watch Tidus and Yuna interact.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:18 PM;and 2: The fact the whole game has to do with catching Pokémo- Mirages.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;That's the beauty of the story and why I can still recommend that game to newcomers;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;it works so well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;as far as Tidus and Yuna go;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;while they may not know each other;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;the relationship is still there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;he's still the corny hero when it comes to her;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:19 PM;"Yeah, I suppose you're right. Their dialogue do feels like something outta FFX.";;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 09:20 PM;You ever notice how no one ever said the name tidus;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:20 PM;"Also, Yuna saying his name just made me lose my mind in squeals and giggles.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:20 PM;"Well, yeah, they never do.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:20 PM;"as for the 2nd part, it depends on how you look at it, the game's plot is much more than that as you go along";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:21 PM;that whole catching mirages stuff is just fake reasoning;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:21 PM;"Oh, really? But, does it take itself seriously?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:21 PM;yes;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:21 PM;O h.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:21 PM;I'm getting Kingdom Hearts vibes.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:21 PM;they use that point as a kick off to their journey;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:22 PM;but it does circle back to your usual save the world stuff you see in every jrpg;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:22 PM;funny enough though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:22 PM;the bad ending is based on the fact that they forgot their original reason for going into grymoire in the first place;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:22 PM;but that's all I'll say about that;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:23 PM;bad ending.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:23 PM;GAH NOW IT TURNED INTO X-2 VIBES.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:23 PM;well I mean that isn't the only jrpg to have that lol;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:23 PM;"I know, I know.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:24 PM;I just kind of have some troubles with X-2.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:24 PM;well endings in this game are easy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:24 PM;"bad ending ==> good ending, , that's how it works";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:24 PM;"Thank goodness. Still, kind of sad I don't see Zidane anywhere. I haven't beaten Disc 1 of IX yet, but I love his character so far.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:24 PM;being as non spoilery as possible;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:25 PM;yeah Zidane is not in the game at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:25 PM;Eiko represents IX;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:25 PM;and only her;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:25 PM;"Welp, dangit.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:25 PM;Should we take this to #general?;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 09:25 PM;Now i want ffx3 again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;#spoilers maybe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;i'm not sure;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;how much more do you want to hear;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;though I guess going over who's in and who's not;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;Nothing about spoilers at all.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;is fine;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;Just checking if you had anything else you wanted to talk about.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:26 PM;And I dunno if X-3 would be a good idea...;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:27 PM;X-3 would be as good of an idea as XIII-2 was (coming from someone who was a fan of the saga);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:27 PM;I don't like the idea of Square endlessly restarting this world's plot;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:27 PM;and characters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:28 PM;over and over and over again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:28 PM;"I think X, X-2, and X-2 Last Mission should be enough";;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 09:28 PM;It could allways be a prequel;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:28 PM;"Yeah, but...listen.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:29 PM;"Jecht's Journey with Braska would be the same, except with a bad ending cause spoilers.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:29 PM;"Besides, all the important things? Already done through the Jecht Spheres.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:29 PM;Maybe if you try to make a Tactics-like game about Zanarkand-Bevelle...;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:30 PM;I wouldn't be opposed to a new game where the mythology and concepts from X carry over;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:31 PM;kinda like how FNC was originally designed;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:32 PM;"Yeah, yeah. I could totally go with that.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:32 PM;I loved Spira.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:32 PM;"It was a weird feeling for such a beautiful world to be filled with such sorrow and false hope. But yet again, I'm still weird about the idea of making a sequel AGAIN.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:33 PM;"VII was lucky to have enough space to make a Compilation Universe, but X ends with a complete ending.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:34 PM;I'm sorta against any game getting sequel tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:34 PM;"I'm more interested in new ideas, new worlds etc...";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:35 PM;I wouldn't mind one but it isn't like omg FF## is getting a sequel;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:35 PM;"But if done right,  I dig it.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:35 PM;I loved CC.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:36 PM;I'd be fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:36 PM;but;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Jul-17 09:36 PM;I just prefer new games;;
BrunoBunno#1489;25-Jul-17 09:36 PM;Yeah absolutely.;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;25-Jul-17 09:37 PM;For some reason went i ever i think of a ff sequel i think of a ton of fan service liie x2;;
Kant over theory#8640;25-Jul-17 11:27 PM;but;;
Kant over theory#8640;25-Jul-17 11:27 PM;they can't just put in x-3 as braska's journey;;
Kant over theory#8640;25-Jul-17 11:27 PM;cuz of 2.5 and the audio track;;
Kant over theory#8640;25-Jul-17 11:28 PM;square developed a new plot and they should resolve it;;
Kant over theory#8640;25-Jul-17 11:28 PM;x-3 probably won't come out until 2020 at earliest tho;;
Sebajv#8990;26-Jul-17 12:09 AM;guys what is the maximum number of players in ff5/6/9?;;
Sebajv#8990;26-Jul-17 12:09 AM;btw if they make a game with braska's pilgrimage they should name it final fantasy x-0;;
Sebajv#8990;26-Jul-17 12:10 AM;just saying;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;26-Jul-17 01:55 AM;Pretty sure its 4 characters a party;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;26-Jul-17 01:55 AM;In all 3 of those games;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 08:01 AM;"Its four characters in those thats the default for FF except 4,12,13 afaik";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 08:51 AM;uh...;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 08:51 AM;it's definitely 3 in FFVII;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 08:51 AM;and I think in FFVIII;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 09:04 AM;4 is the norm though not the exception isn't it?;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 09:05 AM;actually it might be an even split now;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 09:05 AM;"it was 3 for 7,8 and 10";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 10:11 AM;Oh yeah i forgot those 😑;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 10:25 AM;"Hey guys ! new to final fantasy franchise. Just wanted to ask, for someone like me, is it work to pickup final fantasy XV now for singleplayer only, and then play X-1/x-2 remastered ?";;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 10:26 AM;"or maybe I can have better order to play them, and what are the most popular final fantasy ? I've hear most of them have a standalone story";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 10:32 AM;I'd say X HD is a better choice;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:33 AM;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/wiki/wheretostart;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 10:33 AM;As far as most popular it is VI VII and X;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 10:34 AM;FF VII is a great game;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 10:34 AM;not the first FF I have played but its gonna be the first I finish (outside of the best game which is Tactics);;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 10:35 AM;"If you're okay with janky graphics on the PS1 version or want to play the PC version then it really holds up well, and even if you know the *mega spoilers everyone knows* there are a lot of minor story beats you probably dont know";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:35 AM;(in all honesty I recommend FFIV as a first FF);;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 10:35 AM;I'm picking up a lot that I didnt know and its really fun;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:35 AM;(it's by far the simplest one to pick up and play in my opinion);;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:36 AM;(PSP version of course);;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 10:37 AM;(why are you putting everything in parenthesis);;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:39 AM;to separate it from my previous thought;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:39 AM;because clearly a link is a thought;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:39 AM;and also to separate it from other people's previous thoughts;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jul-17 10:40 AM;because I'm self-centered like that obviously;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 10:43 AM;I started on FF8 it was an interesting experience;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 11:02 AM;I think I want to play FF8 next;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 11:04 AM;Ff8...;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 11:09 AM;Its not that bad just lengthy beginning cuzz new mechanics;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 11:10 AM;Sure.mm;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 11:10 AM;Sure...;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 11:11 AM;I was not able to get any where in that game i could only beat it by spaming summons;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 11:18 AM;The game is very breakable but its what happens when the game tells you how to break it;;
Narukami#3478;26-Jul-17 11:41 AM;Should I play 9 or 12;;
Aruu#2066;26-Jul-17 11:42 AM;9!;;
Narukami#3478;26-Jul-17 11:42 AM;I'm playing through 9 and i don't get the battle system at all;;
Aruu#2066;26-Jul-17 11:44 AM;How so?;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 12:25 PM;9;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 12:26 PM;I think it was to slow for him or her;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 12:28 PM;That bar did fill very very slowy;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 12:42 PM;"Please don't ban me, but maybe I liked FFIII more than FFIV lol";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 12:43 PM;Probably because FFIII has a better soundtrack and it's more challenging;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 12:43 PM;Can't say for sure because I didn't finish FFIV yet;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 12:57 PM;Wait would we ban you @Marcello#4574;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 12:57 PM;FF3 as in the onion knights?;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 12:57 PM;Yup;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 12:58 PM;Because I know some people here hate III but IV is loved by many lol;;
Alaric Saltzman#4181;26-Jul-17 12:58 PM;I like ff13;;
Aruu#2066;26-Jul-17 12:58 PM;Banned.;;

Aruu#2066;26-Jul-17 01:00 PM;I'll need a mighty big hammer;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 01:00 PM;i ilke XIII because the battle system is good but XIII-2 has a better battle system plus the benefit of a bonkers plot;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 01:00 PM;A big and sharp hammer;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 01:02 PM;how sharp does a hammer need to be before it becomes an axe?;;
Aruu#2066;26-Jul-17 01:05 PM;Somewhat!;;
Seymour#0747;26-Jul-17 01:07 PM;I haven't played XIII and I don't like it;;
Dinoken2#0946;26-Jul-17 01:14 PM;I did play XIII and I'm not overly fond of it but I do admit there are things about the game I enjoyed.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 01:16 PM;I invested more hours into XIII and its Saga than I would normally do for a game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 01:16 PM;other than VI;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 01:17 PM;but that was more for hacks back when VI's hacking scene was considered a thing;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 01:47 PM;"Who made the Sylph Cave in FFIV should be fired. I'm really starting to hate Malboros, how can I even counter them?";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 01:48 PM;Every monster in that cave was made with the sole purpose to piss you off;;
Narukami#3478;26-Jul-17 01:57 PM;I never played a battle system like ff9 before;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:02 PM;i haven't played ff9 in about 15 years but isn't that just a straightforward interpretation of the ATB?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:02 PM;so you've never played an ATB based game before?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:03 PM;the only problem with IX's combat is that it is too sluggish;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:03 PM;everything takes forever and has to be drawn out;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:03 PM;yeah that game is slowwwwwww;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:03 PM;but other than that it is no different than any other ATB game;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:03 PM;especially on PAL;;
Seymour#0747;26-Jul-17 02:05 PM;what is PAL;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:06 PM;it's an old video standard that was used in Europe and some other parts of the world;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:06 PM;"due to a mismatch between that and the standards used in the US/Japan, a lot of games in the pre-HD world would run much slower on PAL consoles";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:09 PM;Isn't it because PAL games run at 50Hz instead of 60Hz in NTSC games?;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:11 PM;essentially yeah;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:14 PM;newer PAL tvs could do 60hz too though so several games of the GCN/PS2/Xbox generation could take advantage of that;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:16 PM;"there's also a resolution difference, PAL being 576p and NTSC was 480p and a lot of games would just letterbox games rather than adjusting the resolution or reframing";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:16 PM;"It has to do due with how games were made back then, and for the record the concept of NTSC and PAL are irrelevant by todays standards.";;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:17 PM;yeah HD has mostly removed that issue apart from some early 360 games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:17 PM;the speed was bound to however often it could display a completed frame in a gameloop;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:18 PM;"since back when those terms mattered, PAL TVs displayed at a slower rate which meant the game would be slower if there was not any way of offsetting the difference between regions";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jul-17 02:19 PM;"but that doesn't matter anymore, the hardware runs as fast as it can and as fast as the programmers allow it";;

DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:36 PM;Picking some final fantasy games and playing them by relase date is not a bad idea right ?;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:36 PM;"or i ngeneral there's some benefit to play newer one before the older ones ? like for example, final fantasy X/x-2 remaster, then final fantasy XIII and later IX and VII ?";;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:37 PM;I've heard they are very good;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:40 PM;only the specific sequels  such as X-2 or XIII-2;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:40 PM;other than that i'd say play in any order;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:40 PM;but personally i'd skip FFIII unless you're being really completionist;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:41 PM;as pretty much everything it does FFV does better;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:41 PM;Hah but i ment XIII 😄;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:41 PM;so 13;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:41 PM;not 3;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:41 PM;yes but I meant III;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:41 PM;don't play it :p;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:42 PM;but the order doesn't really matter aside from some mechanical refinements between some entries;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 02:45 PM;telling people to skip 3 but not 2;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 02:45 PM;for shame;;
TAFK#2566;26-Jul-17 02:46 PM;you either skip both or play everything;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:46 PM;"well i'd only skip 3 because of the fact that 5 does everything it does and better, not because it's bad, which it is";;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:47 PM;and 2 is reasonably unique and I respect that even if it's not *great*;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:47 PM;"it was the era of the interesting failed sequel and I find value in those games, Castlevania 2, Zelda 2, Metroid 2, FF2 etc even if they're not especially good";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:53 PM;Metroid 2 i liked;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:54 PM;@forpush#4295 I liked FFIII a lot;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:54 PM;The actual Ff3?;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:54 PM;"I'd say skip FFII instead, there's no need to skip III";;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:54 PM;"ah, so you're the one";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;The 3D remake is pretty good;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;nah it's way worse;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;Yeah i like the job games thats why i want 12 HD;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;did some wonky shit to the ATB;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;What?;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;Ff3 has no ATB;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:55 PM;You haven't played FFIII then;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:56 PM;It doesn't have the ATB system yet;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:56 PM;Ff4 introduced ATB;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:56 PM;"well whatever it does, the remake changes how turn order is determined and in some battles it means that bosses get more turns than they should";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:56 PM;It doesn't lol;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 02:56 PM;so the final dungeon is even more bullshit;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:57 PM;Aren't you talking about the 3D remake of FFIV?;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:57 PM;Actually he's not wrong FF3 DS and on has CoD and other bosses hitting up to 3x;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:57 PM;CoD was pretty easy for me;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:58 PM;"Got it first try, actually";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:58 PM;My first roadblock was Doga and Yune;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:58 PM;Mine was Garuda;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:58 PM;I do like how you can cheese job level ups;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:59 PM;It's pretty boring to level them up;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 02:59 PM;It can be worse;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:59 PM;I just leveled new jobs up to level 10 and played with that;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:59 PM;"And in temr os final fantasy XIII, which parts are the best ? because after all, it's a trylogy";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 02:59 PM;"It's also a good idea to defend instead of spamming attack, if you know a moster will be killed in one hit";;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 02:59 PM;I've hear dthe first 2 are good;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:00 PM;XIII is my favorite;;
DivineKataroshie#5628;26-Jul-17 03:00 PM;Whole trylogy ?;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:00 PM;XIII-1;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:00 PM;"I just used Warrior, Black, White, and Dragon the whole way";;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:00 PM;"i'm trying to find the post i found where someone laid out how the battle system was changed in the 3 remake, but it was a somethingawful forum post and it's gone away now oh well";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:00 PM;"I liked the other 2, but not as much as XIII-1. LR is my second favorite";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:01 PM;"The battle system wasn't changed in the remake of FFIII, maybe they tweaked something, but it's the same system";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:01 PM;@forpush#4295 the agility stat is what affects the amount of hits. Each boss gets 2 except CoD;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:01 PM;ah maybe that's it;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:02 PM;i haven't played it since it was re-released so my memory is hazy;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:02 PM;Also like FF1 turn order is random;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:02 PM;i don't remember that but yikes;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:02 PM;Its not that bad generally players will go first;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:03 PM;I can't complain about 3D FFIII battle system;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:04 PM;But some battles in FFIV are very annoying;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:04 PM;i spend hours butting my head against the final dungeon because i would routinely be 1shot by a boss without getting a turn;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:04 PM;which is just.. no;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:04 PM;Well bosses are generally the hey lets break the rules for you cuzz why not;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:04 PM;The recommended level for the final dungeon in FFIII is 60;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:05 PM;You have to grind for a bit and also complete Eureka;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:05 PM;Character or job cuzz i got mastered jobs b4 60 i was just fine;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:05 PM;Character level;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:05 PM;i don't remember what level i beat it at but i managed to brute force it in the end;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:05 PM;"Also, you need to equip all the 4 ribbons you find at the final dungeon, otherwise you will die very quickly";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:06 PM;I was prob 50. I beat it without Ribbons;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:06 PM;The absolute madman;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:07 PM;At least you get fully recovered after beating a boss;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:08 PM;I tend to play poorly my first round xD;;
forpush#4295;26-Jul-17 03:08 PM;i wish i still had the cart i could tell ye what my party makeup was when i finished it;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:09 PM;I still enjoyed it a lot;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:09 PM;The soundtrack is amazing;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:10 PM;I was actually taken back from the world outside. I sat there in my airship motionless just listening to Boundless Ocean;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:11 PM;My favorite is from Doga's place;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:13 PM;"And also, Invincible > Lunar Whale";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:13 PM;Dunno Lunar Whales pretty good;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:14 PM;The Invincible feels like a real hub;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:14 PM;With shops too;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:15 PM;And a Fat Chocobo for whatever reason;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:19 PM;Lunar Whale has a Fat Chocobo too;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:19 PM;It's because the NES version had limited inventory storage;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:20 PM;Oh im aware just never bothered. I do like how its got great equipment but i never have the money to spend;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:21 PM;At least it doesn't cap the max Gil you can carry;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:21 PM;"I finished FFI with 999,999";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:21 PM;"And FFIII with 1,000,000+";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Jul-17 03:22 PM;Well that game its ez to farm money cuzz the uber gear are drops except Ultima;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:22 PM;How to find the Ultima weapon there?;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:23 PM;"I think I got it, but switched for the Eureka weapons after a few minutes";;
Marcello#4574;26-Jul-17 03:24 PM;"Oh, I remember now. It was pretty bad lol";;

fine and dandy#9438;30-Jul-17 10:45 AM;do you think the steam ports of 7-10 are good?;;
Claudia#8474;30-Jul-17 11:20 AM;They are fine.;;
Dinoken2#0946;30-Jul-17 12:09 PM;"They're good, but you should mod the soundtrack of VIII back to the original and not the weird midi version that it comes with.";;
Aruu#2066;30-Jul-17 12:16 PM;FFVIII has some of the most beautiful tracks;;
Dinoken2#0946;30-Jul-17 12:24 PM;I believe VIII's soundtrack is actually Uematsu's favorite.;;
4976#3971;30-Jul-17 12:24 PM;"I'm not big on Final Fantasy VIII, but I agree with that.";;
Dinoken2#0946;30-Jul-17 12:25 PM;But I might have been misinformed on that one.  There is the possibility of people lying on the Internet.;;
4976#3971;30-Jul-17 12:25 PM;People do that fairly often.;;
Aruu#2066;30-Jul-17 12:26 PM;But who would use the internet to tell LIES?;;

4976#3971;01-Aug-17 01:52 PM;"Battle on the Big Bridge if boss battles are included, if you mean just regular ones, probably the one from IX.";;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 01:53 PM;FF8 boss theme....regular battle theme probably Laguna's;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 01:53 PM;FF7 is grating after playing it a couple times;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 01:54 PM;FFT has some of my favorite battle music but they have like 80 battle themes;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 01:54 PM;my favorite for that one has the chimes in it...but i can never remember which one that is;;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 01:54 PM;I love the FFVII 'those who fight further' music;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Aug-17 01:55 PM;Chaos from LR;;
4976#3971;01-Aug-17 01:55 PM;The battle theme for 13 is also really good though.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Aug-17 01:55 PM;oh and Dancing Mad;;

Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:52 PM;This one;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:53 PM;So yeah;;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 02:53 PM;Yesss ❤;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:54 PM;"It sounds so intimidating, like Oh shit this is gonna be tough";;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:54 PM;On the other hand I hated X's boss theme;;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 02:56 PM;"I agree, it's a very samey-sounding track. It got tedious during the longer battles. The normal battle theme is great though";;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:56 PM;oh yeah that ff9 theme is good too;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:57 PM;Standard battle theme in X is probably the best normal battle theme in the series.;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:57 PM;Well XIII's comes close.;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:57 PM;ffx's battle theme was surprisingly....'chipper' for a battle theme;;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 02:57 PM;XIII's battle theme is one of the best pieces of music out of the entire series.;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;8 has my favorite battle themes;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;"regular, laguna, boss theme";;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;"Say what you like about XIII, it had beautiful music. Same goes for FFVIII too";;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;"Polarising games, but the music is gorgeous";;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;I *will* say what I like about 8;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;and what I will say;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;is that it was great;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:58 PM;I love the soundtracks of both those titles.;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 02:59 PM;"It's no secret that VIII is my favorite, but I'm not crazy on the battle themes.  I do like the final boss songs, all three of them though.  I really liked VIII for it's background and scene music";;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 03:00 PM;Succession of Witches so good;;
dxdrummer#7030;01-Aug-17 03:00 PM;listening to the 9 theme now it's pretty awesome too;;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 03:00 PM;FFVIII is a freaking beautiful game. I just don't like how it plays. And Rinoa. But that's besides the point.;;
4976#3971;01-Aug-17 03:00 PM;"I was never big on 8, but it did have fantastic music.";;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:00 PM;III and IV boss battle themes are pretty good too;;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 03:00 PM;FFVI had nice music too. Terra's theme is haunting.;;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:01 PM;There is one very intense from XIII;;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:02 PM;"Can't remember the name, but it plays at Eidolon fights";;
Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 03:02 PM;https://youtu.be/UJMJBW8njaY;;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:03 PM;"That one too, but there is another";;

4976#3971;01-Aug-17 03:04 PM;That's one of my favorite themes.;;

Aruu#2066;01-Aug-17 03:05 PM;YES. That's another good one;;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:05 PM;"Not just on Eidolon battles, but also on some Orphan's Cradle battles";;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 03:05 PM;Battle on the Big Bridge is just a good theme in general.;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Aug-17 03:05 PM;But yeah XIII had one of the best soundtracks;;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:06 PM;"My favorite soundtrack of all time, actually";;
Marcello#4574;01-Aug-17 03:06 PM;"Nier Automata comes next, I think";;

Claudia#8474;06-Aug-17 09:55 PM;"For the Dragon Quest series, it is honestly best to just start from number 1. 1-3 and 4-6 are kind of a continuation in a set of trilogies. Either the SNES or the Mobile will suit you well for 1-3. 4-6 I feel the DS is the best place to play them. 7 and 8 can be played either on the 3DS or the PS2. Personally I prefer the 3DS versions, even though they are graphically downgraded a tad. IX can only be played on the DS. You currently cannot play X as it is an MMO not released in the west.";;

Maybe one of you guys can., , So I just got out of the Bafsk Cave and made it back to Altair, and Mindu just left my party to take care of the sick king. I got a pass in the cave, but I don't know what to do with it yet; it says I can use it to board the Dreadnought, but I'm not at that stage yet (or so I think). I stopped in Poft to learn the Sunfire keyword from Cid., , I get back to Altair and talk to Princess Hilda, and she tells me to go to Kashuan Keep, so I do that; I go back to Poft and take an airship to the castle, only to find nothing to do there and nobody to talk to. There's a sunfire in the middle and a locked door, but that's it. I tried using a keyword on the door and fire, tried using the pass, nothing., , My guide tells me I should go to Salamand and talk to Josef next, and I (painstakingly) walk all the way back there, but then I get to there and talk to Josef, and he doesn't help me out either. He has no clue what the Sunfire does or means.";;

Madlampy [😈🐱👤🐧]#8397;15-Aug-17 05:09 PM;well... seemingly they've made TZA a bit easier and at the same time not changed the bosses up etc... if folk were managing yaz/omega in 12/izjs withotu haste it may not be a breaker after all then... cheers for the answer... time to head back to my save just before pharos then it seems 😄;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Aug-17 06:33 PM;FFVII is good too but FFX is more appealing to modern games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 06:33 PM;FFVII is good too but it may be difficult for those unused to the series;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 06:33 PM;and what he said;;

Sleet64#6654;21-Aug-17 06:38 PM;As long as it keeps me occupied for more than 15 hours like recent games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 06:38 PM;I'll grant that the X expanded universe is much more accessible than the VII expanded universe;;

Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 06:59 PM;"I haven't run an audio disc, but it's running disc 3 and 4 fine as well as other ps1 games";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 06:59 PM;Are 3 and 4 black backed?;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 06:59 PM;"Uh, aren't those fake?";;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 06:59 PM;"Basically I got all 4 discs ina  greatest hits box at swap meet, but disc 1 and 2 are the oddballs";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 06:59 PM;The cover seems odd;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:00 PM;Yes 3 and 4 are black back and typical silver greatest hits style discs;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:00 PM;I'd check for signs of burning...;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:00 PM;"Like, burning an image onto the disc";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:00 PM;It's the kind of cover I could make with my burner lol;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:01 PM;"LightScribe driver, iirc";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:01 PM;"iirc, aren't all ps1 games black backed?";;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:01 PM;That's what I thought;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:01 PM;"Yes, but I believe there are pirated black disks too";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:02 PM;I see no reason why IX should be the exception;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:02 PM;Some weird ass bootlegs though;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:02 PM;guy just printed 1 and 2 but had a normal 3 and 4? I don't get it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:02 PM;"My greatest hits copies have a plain white image on the disc, black backed";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:02 PM;my guess is that he lost the first two;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:02 PM;Yeah every google image result I could find excludes this style;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;popped it into my pc and it had a couple files on it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;A mono color art and silver back looks sketchy to me;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;yeah that's pretty sketchy;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;"but what do I know, I once bought a trumpet that was stolen";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;Was it a blue one?;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;Heh.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:03 PM;Notice how the title doesn't fit the disc...;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 07:04 PM;no;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Aug-17 07:04 PM;"it actually wasn't gold-colored though, it was silver, which at the time I hadn't seen much";;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:04 PM;I wonder what the GW is in the box lol his bootleg signature they leave behind ?;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:04 PM;"Damn, I messed up with the memes";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:05 PM;Never seen a bootlegger leave a sig lol;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:05 PM;"It was pretty cheap so I'm not too burned by the ripoff, very weird never seen anything like it";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:05 PM;"I thought about the blue french horn in How I Met Your Mother, it's not a trumpet";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:05 PM;"Oh yeah, so many good deals can be had for stuff if you scout";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:05 PM;Got a black label VII for 20 bucks the other day at a thrift store;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:06 PM;Yeah man just gotta look for the shtuff;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:06 PM;thats why I was at the local swap meet but now I know a little better on these bootleg discs;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:06 PM;"Anyway, your discs won't work on any ps2 unless you do some swap voodoo";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:06 PM;If you want to play them I'd do it on a PS1 emulator or a chipped ps1;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:07 PM;what the bootleg discs? Or the 3 and 4? Cause 3 loaded up fine when I tested it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:07 PM;The bootlegs;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:07 PM;The reason being is that the discs have tricky region code on them that normal burners just can't write to;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:07 PM;"oh yeah I'm just gunna keep those weirdos as a conversation piece and move on, buy it new on amazon prime for $15 or something lol";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:08 PM;Definitely a funny story;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:08 PM;Personally IX is probably my fav of all the PS1 ffs;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:08 PM;I got a better one about bayonetta 2;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:09 PM;"I got bayo 2 new from Target and when I opened it, the paper with art on it was like printer paper quality and not that kinda plastic stuff they use, the inster was a ripped piece of gta 5 map, and the disc was  a blank disc with no art on it. Yes I got my full refund haha";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-17 07:09 PM;"Never played IX, but so far Metal Gear Solid is my favorite PS1 game and my favorite MGS game too.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:09 PM;IX is a love letter to the series imo;;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:09 PM;but yeah when buying this ff9 I shoulda noticed the silver back discs I just kinda was looking for scratches and it went over my head;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Aug-17 07:10 PM;"Oh well, they'll play on an emulator and its a fun conversation piece";;
Geeds#1959;21-Aug-17 07:11 PM;Thanks for the info and helperoni;;
Sleet64#6654;21-Aug-17 11:53 PM;Anything I need to know before starting my first FF game?;;
Sleet64#6654;21-Aug-17 11:53 PM;FFVII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Aug-17 11:57 PM;"not really, just go at it and have fun";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Aug-17 11:58 PM;I would mention something very spoilery but it is sort of a joke but you likely wouldn't get it if this was your first FF title ever so nvm;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Aug-17 11:58 PM;"everything is mostly straightforward so yeah, good luck and have fun";;
Sleet64#6654;21-Aug-17 11:59 PM;Wait;;
Sleet64#6654;21-Aug-17 11:59 PM;Wtf is time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Aug-17 11:59 PM;The facility is going to blow up;;
Sleet64#6654;21-Aug-17 11:59 PM;No during battle;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;the timer stays during battle;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;oh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;OH;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;Nooooo;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;Lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;That time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;that's your ATB meter lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:00 AM;"when it full, the character will get a turn";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:01 AM;if you switch the settings to wait mode it pause when you select targets;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:01 AM;or abilities;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:01 AM;etc...;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:02 AM;anything that would require some thought;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:02 AM;So if I sit and don't attack they'll keep attaching md;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:02 AM;Attacking*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:02 AM;"if the ATB mode is set to Active, the gauge fills regardless";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:02 AM;even for enemies;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:02 AM;so yeah they will continue attacking even while you decide what you want to do next;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:04 AM;Dang;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:04 AM;you get plenty of time though;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:05 AM;what is it like 10 minutes?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:06 AM;he's not talking about that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:06 AM;he meant the ATB guage in fights;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:06 AM;"anyway, if you don't like active mode";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:06 AM;go in the settings for the game and switch it to wait;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:07 AM;"i never tried wait, does it kinda turn it into something like 1-3?";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:07 AM;no;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:07 AM;not really;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:07 AM;wait mode will pause the guage for everyone and it will only fill up when you aren't doing anything;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:07 AM;it's more like the atb meter pauses for both allies and enemies while you're in targeting mode or selecting an item or spell;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:08 AM;that way when you select what you want a character to do;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:08 AM;though the former differs depending on game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:08 AM;you can take as much time as you want;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:08 AM;"ah, ok";;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:08 AM;People r usually too lazy to read back lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:08 AM;"(interestingly, using wait mode is actively harmful in Chrono Trigger because of the area targeting mechanic)";;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:09 AM;really enjoying XII remaster;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:09 AM;I'll worry about that when I get better @mrmiffmiff#0666 lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:09 AM;different game entirely so don't worry about it;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 12:09 AM;Oh ok xD;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:10 AM;so who thinks the 7 remake will get an announcement?;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;next month I mean;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;announcement about what;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;state of the game I suppose;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;idk;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;"I mean, we've been fed the same lines for awhile now";;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;true;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:11 AM;"game is still far away from release, they're working on hard it";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;followed by more screenshots of midgar;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;i've put it out of my mind for the most part;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;but every now and then someone posts about it;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;and it's hardly any news;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;soon Square-Enix will learn to tell us sweet little lies;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;and their training from the industry greats will be complete;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:12 AM;I thought that was what they were already doing;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:13 AM;yeah but not the way Todd Howard does it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:13 AM;with Todd you know he's lying but you want him to keep doing it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 12:13 AM;lol;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:13 AM;he's such a fun liar to listen to;;
Titus Gray#1111;22-Aug-17 12:13 AM;you're like yeah yeah bs but keep talkin my man;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 12:14 AM;"there was a video of him at some game awards ceremony a while back, everyone started clapping for something, he gave like one clap and stopped, , then he noticed he was being recorded and just sort of glared at the camera";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 01:12 PM;it is a status ailment;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 01:13 PM;I think 50% of normal rate;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 01:13 PM;Oh so it's not some sort of friendship thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Aug-17 01:13 PM;nah;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 01:13 PM;Ok ty;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 02:10 PM;yeah there's an item that can remove it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 02:10 PM;said item will also apply hyper if the character is normal;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 02:10 PM;the item that applies sadness when the character is normal will cure hyper;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 02:10 PM;or was it anger;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 02:10 PM;maybe hyper was the item;;
Triston#0116;22-Aug-17 02:22 PM;"ye hyper was the item, fury was the status";;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:47 PM;So how do I steal items from enemies in FFVII? And how do I run from battles?;;
Technobliterator#1311;22-Aug-17 04:47 PM;"Equip the Steal command Materia, hold down two buttons (depending on version) to run";;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:47 PM;Aww poop;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:48 PM;Don't have that materia;;
Technobliterator#1311;22-Aug-17 04:48 PM;How far are you;;
Technobliterator#1311;22-Aug-17 04:48 PM;You get a Steal materia early in Midgar;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:48 PM;I'm in the shinta building;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:48 PM;Shinra*;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:49 PM;Hm you might've missed it;;

Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 04:51 PM;What I hate the most in all FF games is how easy it is to miss stuff.;;
Technobliterator#1311;22-Aug-17 04:51 PM;Depends on the game;;
Technobliterator#1311;22-Aug-17 04:51 PM;some of them are;;
Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 04:52 PM;The only exceptions so far are XIII and IV;;
Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 04:52 PM;"I'm on VI right now, so I never played VI-XII";;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:53 PM;Well;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 04:54 PM;Do I need to start over;;
Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 04:55 PM;"Never played VII, but probably not.";;
Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 04:56 PM;"Still sucks to miss something, but I wouldn't start over if I already made a lot of progress.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 05:01 PM;VII has a lot of missables yeah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 05:01 PM;but trust me when I say you'll play it again at some point;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 05:01 PM;even if it's several years from now;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 05:01 PM;so just continue onwards;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 05:02 PM;a second playthrough much later would be a good time to play with a walkthrough;;
Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 05:08 PM;Does VI have any Find passages relic like V?;;
Marcello#4574;22-Aug-17 05:09 PM;"I just found a really hard one in the Returners cave, and I'm sure I missed a few of them";;

Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 05:12 PM;But Barrett is the only one that can do damage...;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 05:12 PM;The others are too far to reach;;
Sleet64#6654;22-Aug-17 05:17 PM;"Also, should I use my enemy skill materia";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 06:15 PM;"just have it on someone at all times, the moves are pretty useful";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 06:15 PM;and yeah it would be more ideal to have a long range materia;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 06:15 PM;but otherwise the rest should do magic;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 06:15 PM;aaaaand that was an hour ago;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-Aug-17 06:15 PM;my bad;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 06:39 PM;Lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 06:39 PM;Anyways yeah enemy skill is really good;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 06:39 PM;make sure to have at least 2 ranged users at all times like magic or guns;;
viology#4617;22-Aug-17 09:21 PM;"hey all im playing ff12 (ps4) and noticed that if i let my characters attack with gambits only, they have to get pretty close, as in if im using a bow or gun, they won't attack at max range.

fine and dandy#9438;22-Aug-17 09:22 PM;your party will automatically attack;;
viology#4617;22-Aug-17 09:23 PM;"uh im using nearest visible now, it's pretty much same thing";;
fine and dandy#9438;22-Aug-17 09:23 PM;hmm;;

viology#4617;22-Aug-17 09:24 PM;oh well at least im using best thing possible;;
Sleet64#6654;23-Aug-17 07:58 PM;How come it takes forever sometimes to run away from battle;;

Sleet64#6654;23-Aug-17 08:00 PM;FFVII;;
fine and dandy#9438;23-Aug-17 08:02 PM;the bigger the difference between levels the harder it is;;
fine and dandy#9438;23-Aug-17 08:02 PM;i mean;;
fine and dandy#9438;23-Aug-17 08:02 PM;if an enemy is 10 levels higher than you;;
fine and dandy#9438;23-Aug-17 08:02 PM;it will be harder;;

HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:13 PM;😂;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:13 PM;"I've had a busy week, though you got my attention.";;
Aruu#2066;04-Sep-17 03:13 PM;There's a channel similar to that on the AC Discord called Hangouts. An idea like that could work!;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;Which games were you thinking?;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;I did make General chat as a sort of place where people could hang out and chat.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;and play games. But I'm all for a channel if the mod team are on board.;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;overwatch would be one example;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;Oooh.;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;but there are a ton of other ones;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:14 PM;i personally dont play ff14 but that could also work;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:15 PM;"No, that's not Final Fantasy related so is not allowed. /s";;
Aruu#2066;04-Sep-17 03:15 PM;It'll be useful for Dissidia when that's released;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:15 PM;FF14 could work. There are tons of games you could do. Even servers based off MMOs like Elite Dangerous did sort of splinter into other games. 😄;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:16 PM;cool;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:16 PM;"```, overwatch would be one example, ```, why not just use groups";;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:16 PM;?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:16 PM;I swear this feels like the most under used feature in all of discord;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:17 PM;"More channels wouldn't hurt, imo";;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:17 PM;"groups could also work, yes";;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:17 PM;but i think a channel would be more effective for widespread get togethers;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:17 PM;not really;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:17 PM;or instead of having to friend whoever i want to play with;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:19 PM;"I mean, you could just ask on off-topic or general (if it's FF related)";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:19 PM;But a dedicated channel for that isn't a bad idea;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:20 PM;"the thing is, how practical would it be to have a channel for that?";;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:20 PM;It's not a bad idea at all - It keeps off-topic and general from being clogged up in a sense - in that they're relatively active.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:20 PM;Overwatch for example has one of the biggest discord servers ever;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:20 PM;if you want people to play with you're more likely to find them there than in something completely unrelated;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:20 PM;So...?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:21 PM;same with FFXIV;;
Davkilla101#0932;04-Sep-17 03:21 PM;"Yes, but I imagine that would be hard to read with how fast text moves in those large channels";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:21 PM;Finding people you already know is better;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:21 PM;"also for the mods, maybe some kind of tournament event every now and then could be interesting?";;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:21 PM;maybe tournament is the wrong word;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;but some sort of... group gaming session?;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;^;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;Very interesting idea.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;"```, Finding people you already know is better, ```, how many people would care is the issue, and that determines how practical it is to have a channel for it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;what if it gets added;;
Davkilla101#0932;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;Agreed. Playing with friends and acquiantences is much better than strangers who will likely insist that they've fucked your mom.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;"and no one uses it, or not used very often";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:22 PM;To be fair...;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;then it just ends up being wasted space you know;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;"I don't know. I played with randoms from another discord, ended up meeting my boyfriend from there.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;It's.. nice. 😛;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;Or can be lovely.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;"Very few people use #deleted-channel, #questions and even #spoilers";;
Davkilla101#0932;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;But who wants to do that :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Aruu#2066;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;It's something that is definitely worth a shot;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;Doesn't mean they shouldn't exist;;
Davkilla101#0932;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;Meeting SOs I mean :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Aruu#2066;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;It can always get taken down if nothing comes of it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:23 PM;They have practical uses though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:24 PM;and they are used a reasonable amount of times per week;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:24 PM;I always mute channels I don't use.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:24 PM;often enough to warrant having them exist;;

fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:24 PM;"Ultima, maybe the idea should just be tried out first, instead of shooting it down before it even gets started.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:24 PM;I mean;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:25 PM;I'm not even against creating a #knuckles lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:25 PM;neither am i;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:25 PM;(that would be useless indeed);;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:25 PM;But the point is;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:25 PM;It wouldn't hurt;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:25 PM;Hmmm;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;I'm just saying it would probably be more efficient to just invite people to group DMs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;unless you think it is going to exceed 10 people;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;not really;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;its kind of a tedious process;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;and requires friending everyone you plan to invite;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;But to invite people you need to ask **somewhere** first lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;^;;
fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;true that;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:26 PM;Indeed.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:27 PM;so ask? in #off-topic;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:27 PM;or ask people individually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:27 PM;idk;;
Davkilla101#0932;04-Sep-17 03:27 PM;Yeah but it'll probably get buried under tons of conversation about Knuckles and how he fits in your daily life;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Sep-17 03:27 PM;especially if it is someone you see around the server often;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:27 PM;It's not necessarily the point though - Off-topic can get quite fast and active when it goes fast.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;04-Sep-17 03:28 PM;Oh my.;;

fine and dandy#9438;04-Sep-17 03:28 PM;we should try out the channel?;;

dionit#6049;05-Sep-17 03:59 PM;"so guys, im currently playing FFX and im in the beginning ofthe calm lands. I have 6 black magic spheres at the moment, would it be a good idea to use them to have yuna learn the aga spells from lulu and use her as a black mage instead? or should I wait until i level yuna enough to earn the spells the normal way?";;
Aruu#2066;05-Sep-17 04:03 PM;"It wouldn't hurt, Yuna is very strong magically. However the switching out mechanic means that you can still use Lulu if you needher";;
dionit#6049;05-Sep-17 04:05 PM;i understand. what about using riku instead? her magic might be lower but with her superior agility I should be able to use the spells more often than with lulu or yuna;;
Aruu#2066;05-Sep-17 04:14 PM;"Her magic isn't too great if you follow her 'standard' path. Yuna's magic is one of the strongest in the game, if I remember correctly";;
dionit#6049;05-Sep-17 04:15 PM;yeah. i went and checked and my yuna is at a lower level but her magic is 10 points higher;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Sep-17 06:04 PM;"So, I'm not big on tactical games, but I do remember playing Tactics Advance (or the one that had Montblanc in it, and you were part of his clan. No, I'm not thinking of FF12) on my Gameboy Micro. Now, I also recall Zidane's theme playing when you were selecting a mission (or maybe when you were on the world map). Yet, I can't find any traces of this. Am I going crazy, or is something else in play?";;
Deleted User#0000;05-Sep-17 08:51 PM;"Last time I played X (HD with the expert sphere grid), I took Yuna on a detour through Lulu's -ga spells relatively early on  and Yuna quickly became my go to for elemental magic to the point that I rarely had a reason to bring Lulu out.";;
dionit#6049;05-Sep-17 08:54 PM;"yeah im using the regular grid. my only option is either black magic spheres or teleport spheres. i got 6 BM spheres but 0 TP spheres.  might just get the 4 ga spells though, don't really see a need for the lower versions. and the next time i need the spheres i'll probably have a way to get them more easily.";;
FootloosePhoenix#7519;05-Sep-17 10:00 PM;Do it. Yuna's frankly just a better black mage than Lulu and I always get her to learn those spells as soon as possible.;;

Dinoken2#0946;06-Sep-17 11:51 PM;"@Thor99#4709  If you can, I'd suggest waiting for a GOTY console version that comes with all the DLC bundled.  That way you don't run the risk of dealing with a bad PC port and don't have to buy all the DLC.";;

Hardin#0379;10-Sep-17 04:05 PM;"Friend of mine always insisted in Final Fantasy VIII (8), by the end of the game every character is identical except their limit breaks. I've never really played the game for more than a couple hours, so I can't comment myself on it but I'm curious how true this is. I looked up the base stats of every character at leve 100 ( http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/822/t1191136-character-level-100-default-stats/ ) and it looks like according to this, their stats aren't identical...and if the stats aren't, the limits aren't, and the weapons (I assume) aren't, how true could this possibly be? I know you have the ability to choose who gets what junctions, GFs, magic, etc...so if they turn out identical, isn't that the player's fault then? Or am I wrong?";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Sep-17 06:01 PM;"Functionally they're identical aside from the limit breaks and Squall's trigger ability.  Base stats might be different but the only differences that matter are limits, cosmetics, Squall's trigger, and Squall's gunblades and Selphie's ultimate weapons having a 100% to hit";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Sep-17 06:44 PM;"Basically what Dino said, however the customization comes from the junction system.";;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 06:47 PM;^;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 06:47 PM;Also not every character inherently has to know the exact same spells and such as that.;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 06:48 PM;"It might take a little bit more time but you could focus on making certain characters black mages, green mages, white mages, etc just by what magic you draw on them.";;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 06:48 PM;"One character could get _all_ of the GFs and white/black magic and operate as a summoner, etc.";;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 06:48 PM;So what makes them unique is how you play them.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Sep-17 09:22 PM;"One thing I love to do is set drain to ele attack, so every time you attack, you get healed.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:06 AM;"Yeah, it isn't that they have to be the same. Just that functionally they aren't that different. For me in VIII I made it so each of the GFs were exclusive to a character. Which really helps make things different.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:08 AM;"That's typically how I do it too, yeah, and as a natural result each character leans on different spells.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:09 AM;"Oh, I also gave them each different spells. Though they weren't exclusive just because that felt tedious to do. They did have a static list though.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:10 AM;Yeah having it be exclusive seems... unnecessarily extra.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:10 AM;"But at the same time if you had a three person party that you used consistently, doable and not nearly AS tedious.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:13 AM;"Yeah. That's how it wound up. Squall got most of the healing magic because of that, which is funny.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:14 AM;I was going to make a white mage joke but then I realized that he was just a paladin then.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:14 AM;lol.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:15 AM;"A better healer than Cecil was but yeah basically. Rinoa was a Black Mage obviously, Quistis got status magic because Blue Mage.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:16 AM;I remember the party that I used for endgame (mostly) but don't remember what their specific spell lists were.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:16 AM;I'm pretty sure whenever I've played the game it has been the same as the one you stated or replaced Quistis with Selphie.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:17 AM;I just liked Blue Magic more than Slots. But I would have replaced Squall with Selphie. Magic team go.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:17 AM;Magic team in a game like FF8 is totally doable too because of the stats thinmg.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:20 AM;It is. It's what I try to do in every FF though. Some that's trickier than others.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:22 AM;A lot of the time I go for a mostly magic team and end up using two (or three depending on the game) mages and one tank.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:23 AM;"eg FFX my endgame team is often Rikku, Yuna, and Tidus with Rikku and Yuna operating as Red Mages, IX I go with Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Eiko, etc.";;

Aruu#2066;12-Sep-17 12:03 PM;There is a file you can download for Steam that has all the crests and whatnot at the start of the game;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Sep-17 12:03 PM;"maybe worth doing if you don't have the patience, or for a later playthrough";;
themockingguy#6969;12-Sep-17 12:04 PM;"I'm playing it on the PS4, so no cheating AFAIK";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Sep-17 12:05 PM;"Though, the real question is: Will the game recognize you actually have the stuff, before you should, and allow you to unlock their full potential ASAP, or would you still have to do the sidequests/hair pulling?";;
Dinoken2#0946;12-Sep-17 12:08 PM;Man I didn't know I could cheat on Steam.  Might actually attempt some of the endgame content then.;;

BrunoBunno#1489;12-Sep-17 12:34 PM;It's called Fast Travel.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;12-Sep-17 12:34 PM;But it takes just as long as it would take via car;;

Dinoken2#0946;12-Sep-17 03:29 PM;I doubt it.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Sep-17 03:40 PM;**Looks at FF15 pocket edition**;;
Mirron#9949;12-Sep-17 05:54 PM;That sounds nice honestly.;;
Treble#5035;12-Sep-17 06:24 PM;Tbh I can see the game being on the Switch at a slightly lowered graphic level;;
Treble#5035;12-Sep-17 06:24 PM;But I think it's more likely that eventual ff5 and ff6 remakes will be on the Switch;;
Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Square tried to run FFXV in Switch but the engine couldnt handle it;;
Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 12:40 AM;that being said;;
Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 12:40 AM;why dont release FFXV Pocket Edition for switch?;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:18 AM;Because the pocket edition is too low res.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:18 AM;It'd be a 3DS release if anything.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:18 AM;What's going to happen with the Switch is they're either going to lower the res of the main game port or skip it and rectify the problems for VIIR or XVI;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:19 AM;if the pocket edition doesn't come then XV will be skipped on the platform entirely;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:20 AM;Which seems like the best thing to do tbqh.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:20 AM;"given that the engine barely ran on current gen without a million hacks and cover ups to hide problems, the switch would just introduce more problems that aren't worth dealing with at all";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;"as for VIIR and XVI, well it depends";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;"It's an issue worth fixing for future installments of the series, because they can work on fixes to lower the resolution enough for it to work, but I think that for XV it'd be a bit much.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;VIIR has only been announced for PS4 atm so nothing can be said about that just yet;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;If Nintendo wants to cash in if I were them I'd make the Pocket Edition a 3DS title.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;"and XVI, well they already deemed current gen to not be enough for whatever visions they have for future FF titles";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;"I think we'll probably see NT on the Switch when it releases for One, PS4, etc.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;which I think is bullshit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;but;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;"I mean, PC.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:21 AM;this is Square;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:22 AM;Yeah I don't see them sticking to that.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:22 AM;NT is also exclusive iirc;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:22 AM;Unless they forego XVI until after the entire 7 series.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:22 AM;"It is, but they've expressed intention to release it on the other consoles and PC after a while.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:23 AM;ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:23 AM;timed exclusives are something aren't they;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:24 AM;though it has been common knowledge(or should have been) what you need in order to keep up with the franchise but these days the franchise seems to be having trouble keeping up with itself lol;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:25 AM;I think they would do well to focus on spin offs and sequels for a while.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:25 AM;"Like they did between 12 and 13, though the whole Fabula whatever umbrella was being worked on.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:26 AM;"eh, I wouldn't really be ok with that tbh";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:26 AM;mainly because XV is the only game atm;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:26 AM;and I feel like something like WoFF was a once in a lifetime game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:27 AM;as far as spinoff and sidecontent they have more than enough if you gather up all of the mobile games they keep releasing;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:27 AM;"Well, the next big installment is VIIR, so they're already leaning that way already.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:27 AM;They've expressed interest in X-3 and are intentionally keeping interest in X alive for some reason.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:27 AM;NT is going to be an ongoing presence.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:28 AM;X-3 in itself is just pointless I remember the article you're referencing about that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:28 AM;X-3 is just... no;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;no more;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;I'm not saying I want it I'm saying _they_ want it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;everytime they try to expand on X's universe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;it gets worse;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;Because as it is I actively ignore -will- in the first place.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;"Oh, and also, they've expressed intent in remaking V and VI.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:29 AM;Either before or after the release of VIIR.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:30 AM;I'm just not really interested in anything they have going on atm;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:30 AM;I can understand that.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:30 AM;NT kinda had me excited until I played it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:30 AM;has potential but all of my problems are things that will not be fixed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:30 AM;considering the game has been out in arcades for 2 years;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:31 AM;I'm only hoping they atleast fix the godawful netcode;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:31 AM;that makes Dark Souls netcode look as smooth as butter;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:32 AM;"I haven't played NT, I'm waiting for it to come out to try it but I knew there would be problems just in how the game itself is presented in the first place.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:32 AM;I'm incredibly excited for the prospect of V and VI remakes though even if not a whole lot excites me about the franchise's future.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:33 AM;I just want to know who thought it was a good idea that;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:33 AM;"They could fit that in next year since there seems to be a noticeable gap in titles other than NT between years, since most people assume that 7R is a 2019 release.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:33 AM;if one person is lagging;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:33 AM;the entire game pauses;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:33 AM;for EVERYONE;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:34 AM;That's an online issue so it can and will probably be fixed via a patch update.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:34 AM;Maybe even the Day 1 Patch.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:34 AM;there shouldn't be a day 1 patch for that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:35 AM;it should be fixed while the game is still in development for the rest of the year;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:35 AM;"It should, I'm just not holding my breath.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:35 AM;Mainly because Square is so iffy with fixes.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:35 AM;I get ya;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:35 AM;I mean they delayed FFXV for 2 months and we still got a fairly large day 1 patch;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:36 AM;for a game that supposedly went gold already;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:36 AM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:36 AM;Day 1 patch is usually to prevent early data mining or access;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:37 AM;">announces the game went gold, >announces it will be delayed becuase of bugs, >bugs still exist";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:37 AM;the leaks were spot on;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:37 AM;Or just an excuse for delivering a broken game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:37 AM;"when I originally saw those leaks, I didn't believe it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:38 AM;"just didn't sound like square, but everything lines up perfectly";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:38 AM;It is absolutely most often an excuse to release a broken game and then sometimes the patch doesn't even fix it.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:39 AM;"Look at Mass Effect Andromeda. They basically had to go back and remake parts of the game even AFTER multiple patches, including day 1.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:39 AM;And as a result the team lost their opportunity to give the game any DLC.;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:39 AM;Nier Automata still broken. Never got a single update.;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:39 AM;"Actually, it got one: dlc support";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:39 AM;That's a first;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:41 AM;it says something about what companies think of their fans;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 01:41 AM;that they would bother releasing such a trainwreck;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:41 AM;They could had just taken the money and leave at that;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:41 AM;Like most companies do;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:41 AM;Also that they would give such a beloved franchise to an untested studio.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:42 AM;They better be treating DA4 with care.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:42 AM;If they're not it could end them.;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:42 AM;It's been a while since EA released a good game;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:42 AM;I mean;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:43 AM;I'm not treating it as DA;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-17 01:43 AM;An actual good game;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:43 AM;I'm treating it as Bioware.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:43 AM;"I mean, there was Dragon Age Inquisition.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:43 AM;Which is why I said they need to treat DA4 with care. DAI is basically beloved apart from wide open spaces.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:44 AM;"Which is funny because MEA had that, and then did everything that DAI got right, wrong. At least as far as the LGBT representation went, which was the key criticism of MEA.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:44 AM;(Other than the faces issue);;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:45 AM;Google it.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:46 AM;"MEA had a massive misstep in the representation of a transgender character and treated the (male) gay romance options more or less like an after thought, though part of that is how they treated the male love interests in general.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:49 AM;"As a gay man, no it's not.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:49 AM;And I'm not going to get into this argument with you because it'll get heated fast.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 01:49 AM;And I actually _like_ it here so I'd rather not get kicked.;;
Yikes!#9999;13-Sep-17 04:32 AM;i could see 16 being a ps5 launch title;;
Yikes!#9999;13-Sep-17 04:32 AM;who knows when the next console's coming out;;
Yikes!#9999;13-Sep-17 04:33 AM;sony and microsoft seem happy to just release slightly faster consoles and keep their platform going;;
Yikes!#9999;13-Sep-17 04:33 AM;considering both consoles are x86 there aren't really any backwards compatability issues;;
Mirron#9949;13-Sep-17 08:38 AM;"I don't really play Bioware games much, but when I did actually having options as a gay guy was huge, and really one of the  things that makes me like them a lot. So hearing that about Mass Effect kind of sucked.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:38 PM;The option was there but it wasn't remotely well done.;;
Akrasia#7355;13-Sep-17 12:39 PM;"Hi guys! I'm a complete stranger to the FF series. I've done some researching and people said that a total stranger should start with either FF:X or FF:V. I was wondering which of the two I should play first, and also if anyone knows a good place where I can get the FF:V for PC port - a rather large amount of steam reviews complain about the port available on steam., , In other words, for someone absolutely unfamiliar with FF, which would be better? FF:V or FF:X? If FF:V, where would be a good place to download it? (preferably legit but doesn't need to be, I can pay money for the steam version afterwards if I download a pirated version)";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:40 PM;X will likely be more engaging but that depends on you;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:40 PM;"as for where to find V, the main issues are the quality of the sprites";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:40 PM;all modern ports of that game are the same as the steam version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:40 PM;so playing it on iOS or Android doesn't make much of a difference;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:41 PM;if you can tolerate the sprites then get it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:41 PM;if you can't then emulate it either on the original SNES or GBA;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 12:41 PM;take your pick;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:41 PM;"Yeah, I'd mimic that.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:42 PM;Though generally I think that FFX might be more 'new user' friendly.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:42 PM;"It was the first game with voice acting, the first game for the PS2, has a very well done tutorial, etc.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:43 PM;FFV is basically classic pre-modern era FF fare and though it does tell you how to do things there's also a part that expects you to know a little.;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-17 12:44 PM;"Yeah, there's basically 2 types of main series FF's, Clasic (Pre-FFVII) and modern (FFVII - FFXV). Usually the more engaging ones are the modern ones";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-17 12:45 PM;the classic ones can get a little too grindy and not as engaging for new players;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Sep-17 12:46 PM;"FFIV is classic but has a modern feel if you play a good version of it, in that it's not too grindy and relatively engaging";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-17 12:47 PM;"I usually recomend to start on a  modern FF that apeals to you (except the MMO's XI & XIV), the most popular one is X";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:48 PM;"Yeah, FFIV is more like the exception to the rule.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 12:48 PM;FFV is one of the worst cases for being grindy though.;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-17 12:48 PM;IV and VI are also good choice if you want to play a classic one;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-17 12:48 PM;"I haven't played IV, but I'm going to go what this guys say ^";;
Akrasia#7355;13-Sep-17 12:53 PM;"Alright, thanks everyone for answering my question :) , I'll leave this group for now so that I avoid getting spoiled by accident";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Sep-17 12:54 PM;IX is also a good option if you want a mixture of both classic and modern;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-17 12:54 PM;"we don't usually spoil story things, mostly gameplay discusion if any";;

monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:27 PM;"patches usually don't remove things from the game, but if they do then you will receive a fair amount of warning";;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:27 PM;"typically removed things are just, like, tomestone variations";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:13 PM;And technically yea story reason;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:13 PM;It's like any classic game in that era;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:13 PM;It doesn't really DO post game content.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:13 PM;BUT you can reload;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:13 PM;Both V and VI had;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;that's because you play remakes;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;the original versions didn't have that;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;Or do before final boss;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;and VII's steam version is basically the original;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;just with some updated graphics and dialogue;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;Didn't VI have an optional dungeon on the SNES version?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;optional dungeon;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;more like;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;oh;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;SNES?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:14 PM;no;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;at least not the Dragon's Den if that's what you're talking about;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;I'm pretty sure that was all added in the GBA versions.;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;Both Dragon's Den and Soul Shrine?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;also only Advance;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;I don't think it was even in the PSX version;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;Soul Shrine only becomes available after both the main story and Dragon's Den are completed so;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;yeah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:15 PM;definitely not;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:16 PM;I guess I'll finish everything now then;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:16 PM;just fyi;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;final boss is very easy if you're strong enough to beat Weapons;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;well Ruby and Emerald that is;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;At least it doesn't have any optional bs dungeon;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;I'm level 63 lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;yeah u good;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;lol;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:17 PM;I'm pretty sure I'm overleveled;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:18 PM;"oh, another note, if you get Knights of the Round, thing to know, final boss has three phases, if you use KotR on the first phase, the next two phases will be stronger";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:18 PM;otherwise they'll have weaker versions;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:18 PM;that's all I'll say;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:18 PM;it's just something you should know;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:18 PM;Ultima + Comet is doing pretty well so far;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:19 PM;Oh tho;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:19 PM;If you can beat Emerald WEAPON you don't need the gold chocobo to get KOTR;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:19 PM;Is that really a thing? I thought only your levels determined phase 2;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:20 PM;I read on my mod's page that they changed the final boss' name;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:20 PM;From 'Safer' to 'Sapher';;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:20 PM;Corrected;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:20 PM;Actually;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:20 PM;that's a corrected spelling and even that's not quite right;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:20 PM;should be Seraph;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;Seraph Sephiroth doesn't even sound right;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;Sapher is best.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;you're right;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;but it's still more accurate;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;"Careful with the spoilers, I'll find out why later";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;Seraphimon;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;"Nothing that's been said is a spoiler, I was just saying that Seraph doesn't quite SOUND right.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;I'm gonna say something in #spoilers to continue on my line of thinking here;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:21 PM;Aite;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:22 PM;I meant the reasoning behind those words;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:22 PM;Yeah this probably should move to spoilers;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:22 PM;I don't even know what 'Sapher' or 'Seraph' means;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:22 PM;well;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:22 PM;kek;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:22 PM;I'll explain it when you beat the game;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:23 PM;you didn't see that message;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:25 PM;"I don't know why you deleted it, but that's fine lol";;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;"Also, is this fine for the Weapons?";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;uhhhhh;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;HP is low because of the summon materias;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;use plenty of HP+ materia;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;like;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;you want 9999 or close to it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;especially for Emerald I think;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:26 PM;Shit lol;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:27 PM;I have a HP Plus mastered already;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:27 PM;We'll see;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:28 PM;you can use cheat engine to give yourself a bunch of others lol >_>;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:28 PM;just kidding don't do that it's very dishonest and not something I would ever consider doing;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:28 PM;no sirree;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:29 PM;I mean _I would._;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:31 PM;"Suuuure, because Cheat Engine is bad";;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:32 PM;You need to play the game the intended way;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:33 PM;(like I have time for that shit);;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:35 PM;Yeah Ruby and Emerald are the end game super bosses;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:36 PM;Ruby's hard too lol;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:36 PM;Diamond is mandatory;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:36 PM;yeah that's true;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:36 PM;Ruby's hypothetically harder than Emerald but Emerald is more tedious;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:36 PM;definitely be prepared for that one;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Sep-17 08:37 PM;like have the Underwater materia and all;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:37 PM;Also they get harder and longer from 8+ (that's what she said);;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 08:37 PM;I meant Ruby;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:38 PM;You basically need to beat Emerald if you wanna do a 100% playthrough without Chocobo farming;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:38 PM;That's the only other way to get KOTR materia.;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:40 PM;I'm almost making a backup save and going straight to the final boss;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:44 PM;aaaaand I just read the Gold Chocobo requirements;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:44 PM;"I'm cheating on this shit, I don't care";;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:45 PM;I think I'd just beat Emerald tbqh;;
Treble#5035;15-Sep-17 08:45 PM;Tho if you want more than one I suppose you need to do... both...;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:50 PM;Wow;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:50 PM;A random gold chocobo just appeared in the stables;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 08:51 PM;*I had nothing to do with it*;;

Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 09:14 PM;I didn't;;

BrunoBunno#1489;15-Sep-17 09:16 PM;IT JUST HAPPENED THAT I HAD 99 ELIXIRS;;
BrunoBunno#1489;15-Sep-17 09:16 PM;AND THERE WERE MANY MAGIC POTS;;

Mirron#9949;15-Sep-17 11:06 PM;I don't really see much issue with cheating if all you're doing is cutting down on grinding myself.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Sep-17 11:24 PM;that or if you've already beaten the game;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:53 PM;I only cheat if it's really grindy;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:53 PM;I had to cheat on XIII-2 to get the slot machine fragment;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:53 PM;"Tried to use a rubber band on my controller, but after 3h it didn't work";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Sep-17 11:56 PM;If I feel something is worth cheating in a way to achieve something I would have to normally work for;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Sep-17 11:56 PM;I probably won't play at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Sep-17 11:56 PM;that being said;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Sep-17 11:57 PM;I stopped playing XIII-2 after not being able to get the fragments for the minigame in Serendipity;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Sep-17 11:57 PM;as well as not finishing Sazh's dlc because fuck both and I did everything that was worth doing already lol;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:58 PM;I only cheated in Serendipity because it was unreasonable;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:58 PM;And I was almost getting all the fragments;;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:59 PM;"Btw, if you still want to get that last fragment, do you want the CT table?";;
Marcello#4574;15-Sep-17 11:59 PM;It was really a pain to find;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Sep-17 11:59 PM;"nah, plus I played this way back when it was a console exclusive so that would be of no use to me anyway lol";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:00 AM;if I were to play it again I wouldn't bother at all;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:00 AM;"Yeah, me neither";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:00 AM;I only did it for the achievement;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:00 AM;ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:00 AM;yeah I've tried being a completionist;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:00 AM;not cut out for the job;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:01 AM;It was fine until Serendipity;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:01 AM;I cheated on XIII too for the treasure achievement;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:01 AM;"Actually, I unlocked it right away";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:01 AM;But everything else was legit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:01 AM;Did you also have a huge amount of difficulty with getting Academia's map to 100% exploration;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:02 AM;I remember that shit was so fucking frustrating;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:02 AM;The last Academia?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:02 AM;one tiny little pinch and it took me forever to get it filled in;;

Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:03 AM;"I think that was fine, I'm not sure";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:03 AM;I can't remember which version it is right away;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:03 AM;The worst one was the platforming version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:03 AM;the opposite version of the Adam rampage one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:03 AM;like the good future version or w/e;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:04 AM;oh yeah the final version in 500AF was annoying too;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:04 AM;4XX you mean?;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:04 AM;Just checked it;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:04 AM;400 is the battle zone version;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:05 AM;4XX is the day and peaceful;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:05 AM;And 500 is the one with the platforms;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:05 AM;yeah that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:06 AM;specifics™;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:06 AM;"But anyway, iirc it was fine to get 100% exploration";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:06 AM;"Even maxing out the crystarium was easy, I didn't have to grind at all";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:06 AM;Just had to kill that easy superboss twice and done;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:07 AM;I forgot how I maxed it out actually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:07 AM;I know it was definitely not as time consuming as XIII;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:07 AM;It wasn't too bad in XIII because the PC version has easy mode;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:07 AM;I should play it XIII-2 and LR again I miss those games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:08 AM;though I don't support Square's bullshit ports;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:08 AM;🤔;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:08 AM;I don't know if I would replay XIII-2 any time soon;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:08 AM;I prefer the other 2 games;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:09 AM;"Well, it runs just ok";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:09 AM;You can cap it to 30fps and it will be fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:09 AM;I know;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:10 AM;I just don't feel like they deserve me giving them more money for such a lame port;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:10 AM;of course my one $20 is meaningless over the amount of profit gained over the years the game has been available but I live what I preach so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:10 AM;yeah lol;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:11 AM;"Also, they seem to have learned from their mistakes";;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:11 AM;LR is a huge improvement over the 2 previous games;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:12 AM;And I think XV will be decent;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:12 AM;it better be fucking amazing given how much they hyped it up;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:12 AM;even if it was a glorified NVidia commercial;;

Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:12 AM;Let me see if there is some sort of analysis;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:17 AM;don't count on it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;I mean this is the same Tabata that promised that they would optimize the Pro patch to achieve 60fps;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;and that was a complete lie;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;3 of these problems are really basic stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;all they did was unlock the framerate;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;but I guess if you stare at the ground that is 60fps;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;"If they don't address those issues, they are very incompetent";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:18 AM;must've been what their benchmarks were based on;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:19 AM;yeah given how much Tabata expressed he wanted this PC version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:19 AM;and how he thinks current gen is not enough for what future FF titles want to achieve;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:19 AM;the PC version better be one of the best ports of all time;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:19 AM;Also take note it's a very early version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:19 AM;no reason for it not to;;
Dinoken2#0946;16-Sep-17 12:20 AM;Given Square's history I doubt it.;;
Dinoken2#0946;16-Sep-17 12:20 AM;But here's to hoping.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:21 AM;"Considering how LR had graphic options, true 4k and good scaling, I think those issues will be addressed";;

Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:21 AM;"I mean, those are pretty basic stuff";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:21 AM;just like they fuck up a lot of other stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:22 AM;"```,  LR had graphic options, ```, from what I heard these do little to nothing";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 12:22 AM;and the game is still internally a 7th gen game at heart;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:22 AM;They also said they are working to lower the requirements so most people with similar hardware to the current gen will be able to run it well;;
Marcello#4574;16-Sep-17 12:22 AM;They actually do;;

Mirron#9949;16-Sep-17 12:50 PM;FFXI remastered?;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:03 PM;It's getting ported/remade/remastered (not sure which) for mobile.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-17 02:03 PM;A MMO on mobile?;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:04 PM;"Yeah, it's probably gonna have some typical gacha system or whatever.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-17 02:04 PM;"in other words, free to play with pay to win microtransactions";;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:04 PM;"After All the Bravest and that FFXV Empire game, I basically have no interest in SE's mobile scene, so I'll just stick to playing XI on PC.";;
Dinoken2#0946;16-Sep-17 02:07 PM;Man that's disappointing.  I was hoping they were going to condense XI down to a single player game now that it's pretty much over.;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:09 PM;"Well, it's more or less condensed to a single player game on PC.";;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:09 PM;Since you can party with overpowered NPCs now and they replace players in all content except the hardcore endgame stuff.;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:10 PM;"I think the party size in XI is 6, so you can get 5 NPCs.";;
Dinoken2#0946;16-Sep-17 02:11 PM;Ah I see.  I might need to finally get around to playing it then.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-17 02:19 PM;Is it still subscription based?;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:20 PM;Yep.;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:20 PM;They recently re-opened the 14 day free trial for those who want to try the game out.;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:20 PM;Just fair warning that it still uses PlayOnline and it's a really bad system.;;

Dinoken2#0946;16-Sep-17 02:28 PM;Bah subscription based.  There goes that idea.  Whelp I'll just stick to considering playing XIV.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-17 02:31 PM;which becomes subscription based after a while;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-17 02:31 PM;level 35 I think;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 02:32 PM;It is way more worth it than a dead game still requiring you to pay;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-17 02:32 PM;only to end up doing most of the content solo;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:34 PM;"XIV becomes subscription based once you buy it, so it works the same way as WoW. The free trial is unlimited time with a level cap and gameplay restrictions.";;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:34 PM;"Also, XI still has an impressive community going.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-17 02:34 PM;Is it still worth if I hardly play it in the first place?;;
Valvadrix#4224;16-Sep-17 02:35 PM;"If you hardly play, you'll definitely not get your money's worth.";;

monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 01:42 AM;"if it's the sexist thing, i mean, there were no permanent female party characters, out of the two (arguably) major women in the game, one of them has a weird oedipus-y relationship with noctis and then she dies halfway through the game, her death being used to move the plot forward. which, yes, can be done well, but i think it wasn't done well in this instance. it felt forced and it also felt like, through the shape of the narrative, that the main reason she died was to deny noctis a girl, even though her death had much greater consequences. you could make the argument that this is because the game is through noctis's viewpoint, this excuse being used to explain why the Episodes are extra paid content, but it just felt like we were supposed to be upset that noctis can't be with his arranged wife. big whoop for him. she's the one who died., and the other character is cindy, and i don't feel like i need to explain that at all. you'd just be feigning ignorance if you asked about that., of the others, there's iris, who did basically nothing but give you a stuffed animal and some potions, who apparently was given more background in extended content that nobody cares about, and aranea, who honestly is the best female character in the game but only appears sporadically unless you exploit some weird glitch to keep her in the party. she plays a more major role in, once again, content that is separate from the base game., it just felt like this game had the least amount of focus and development and agency in its female characters out of the ff games i've played. i've never even felt like an ff game had fanservice before, but i haven't played X-2, which i'm told is like softcore porn";;

Dinoken2#0946;22-Sep-17 09:03 PM;"I think it's just the mages.  Freya doesn't look anything like a traditional dragoon, nor does Zidane really look like a thief.  Steiner looks like a classic knight, but not a fighter from FF1.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Sep-17 09:08 PM;`Nor does Zidane really look like a thief.` And that's why he's the best thief;;

Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 11:12 PM;Both Hope and Vanille have good Magic stats though. And Hope/Vanille have the same roles except Hope can buff and Vanille debuff. Why I think of Hope as the White Mage more and Vanille the Black.;;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 11:28 PM;"It doesn't really matter. Magic don't usually do a lot of damage, you just want to stagger the enemy as fast as you can, so that's why Lightning is the best ravager, or 'black mage'";;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 11:28 PM;"However, Hope gets access to Thundaga first, iirc";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 12:37 AM;Yeah Hope has easier access to higher black magic and that's where Last Resort is;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 12:37 AM;Whereas Vanille's is in White Magic?;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 02:06 AM;I get the reasoning behind why Hope is seen as a Black Mage. I think that either works and it's all about how you weigh different aspects both have.;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 02:06 AM;I'm not sure how to view Lightning and Sazh though. I guess Lightning is a Red Mage kind of.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:07 AM;Lightning's basically a Black Mage who uses elemental weapons;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:07 AM;I believe Lightning was based on red mage.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:08 AM;"Either way, she uses elemental weapons";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 02:09 AM;"I mean, I tend to think of enelemental stuff as Red Mage stuff. And she has Medic.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 02:09 AM;I don't associate Medic with Black Mages at all.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:10 AM;True;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:10 AM;I guess maybe more like a red battlemage;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:10 AM;Yeah I'd call Light a red battlemage and Hope a red mage.;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:15 AM;"To be honest, you can't really describe XIII's characters with job names";;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:15 AM;Otherwise they are all Red Mages;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:16 AM;They do have things their playstyles were based on though;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:16 AM;"Lightning was meant to resemble a red mage through and through, Snow was meant as a warrior, etc.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:17 AM;It's kinda like with 12;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:17 AM;I disagree lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:17 AM;"7, 8, and 12";;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:17 AM;All of them can become anything you want;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:17 AM;"Like there's no job classes in 7, but I'm sure pretty much everyone here would consider Aerith a White Mage";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:18 AM;"or at the very least, a Summoner";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:18 AM;9;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:18 AM;It's like 9 is what I'd say.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:18 AM;There are no job classes but you can tell as fans of the series what everyone is meant to be.;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:19 AM;With XIII it's even more different;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:19 AM;Nobody will agree with each character's 'job';;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:19 AM;"It's a bit different but in keeping with the Lightning example, her initial Crystarium set up has her using black magic, white magic, and physical combat... like a red mage.";;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:20 AM;She was better as a Commando for the most part of the game;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:20 AM;"Plus, people have generally agreed each character has specific strengths, more than the others. Like Lightning is best Ravager.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:20 AM;Fang's best Commando;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:21 AM;+before getting Fang;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:21 AM;"Actually, before upgrading Fang";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:21 AM;I'd consider Light to be a Red Battlemage;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:22 AM;Each character is diverse enough to make it impossible to precisely describe each;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:25 AM;Other than stats each character can be almost identical... if you unlock the other parts of the crystarium.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 02:25 AM;But we're basing it just on the three they already have access to.;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:26 AM;Then Lightning would be just as good as Fang lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 02:26 AM;"Well, at anyrate, I should be going to bed real soon here. Gotta get up early (for me at least).";;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:26 AM;"Also, iirc, Fang already has the Saboteur role unlocked, so that makes her a black mage too";;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 02:26 AM;"Yeah, me too, it's very late here. Good night";;
monokomonoe#8934;23-Sep-17 01:13 PM;I thought Hope was the best ravager?;;
monokomonoe#8934;23-Sep-17 01:14 PM;Or is it that Lightning's cast speed outweighs her lower magic stat;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 01:15 PM;Light is faster;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 01:16 PM;"...and will always be, no matter the referential /physicsjoke";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 01:17 PM;Hope has the highest magic power and Lightning is faster so that probably makes it's likely subjective based.on whomyou prefer;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 01:19 PM;The chances a lot of the time though for a while if you're using Hope is that he should be party lead to lessen damage seeing as he also has the least hp so I tended to use him as rav in paradigms with just ons;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:50 PM;as a matter of fact;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:50 PM;Vulkan as an API is pretty neat;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:50 PM;unless you're making a AAA game;;

Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:50 PM;"Oh, yeah";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:50 PM;and other similar one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;is of no use to the common user;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;It wasn't designed for regular games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;or regular apps;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;The deprecated Mantle?;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;I see;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;Duuude;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;Mantle was awesome at that time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:51 PM;yeah it was more for getting the most out of your GPU that you possibly can;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:52 PM;if you want to just generally create apps with 3D acceleration;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:52 PM;"I had a AMD GPU, so playing Battlefield 4 with Mantle was amazing";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:52 PM;DX11 and OpenGL4 are fine;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:52 PM;It was literally a 30fps improve over DX11;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:52 PM;that's the power of low level graphics programming;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:52 PM;We can thank AMD for Dx12 and Vulkan;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;DX12 also supports SLI regardless of hardware;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;which is something interesting to note;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;of course most games don't use that shit anyway so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;it is just a cool type thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;I still highly dislike OpenGL though;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;There was a lot of rumours about Dx12 supporting multi-GPU setups of any brand combinations;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:53 PM;but tolerate it enough because I like how simple GLSL is;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:54 PM;"It was very hyped, but I could consider it a failure";;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:54 PM;OpenGL seems like the best API for simple stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:54 PM;I hope you aren't talking about;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:54 PM;when you made that statement;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:54 PM;I don't even know what you are talking about lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:55 PM;sit down for a short history lesson;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:55 PM;long ago;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 07:55 PM;But OpenGL seems like trying Unity before going into Unreal (engine);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:55 PM;GPUs couldn't do shit graphically speaking;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:55 PM;so OpenGL and early DX (9 and older);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:55 PM;had this system called the FFP;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:56 PM;basically generic shaders and simple rendering stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:56 PM;handled by the GPU;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:56 PM;It was easy to use;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:56 PM;but really really bad for performance;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:57 PM;OpenGL had it the easiest since you could plot vertices just by calling simple functions;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:57 PM;"glVertex(...), glTexCoord(), etc....";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:58 PM;"DX had it too but with a more logical design setup, you simply sent the GPU a pointer to the vertices and it would copy it and setup shit to send to the GPU";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:58 PM;basically it was bad;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:59 PM;"then programmable shaders were introduced, and there was not ever a need to use that again";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:59 PM;and now the FFP is simply emulated;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 07:59 PM;for compatibilty reasons;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:00 PM;Very interesting;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:00 PM;I want to learn this kind of stuff one day;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:01 PM;I spent way too long wasting my time with load electronics;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:02 PM;this stuff has been a huge part of my life for 4 years now;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:02 PM;made more mistakes than I could count;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;and still have many more to make unfortunately;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;I find it fun;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;```made more mistakes than I could count```;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;Don't we all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;from a learning perspective;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;I wouldn't say unfortunately;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;and just seeing things come together;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:03 PM;"I made a lot of mistakes too, but they just made me a better script kiddie";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:04 PM;"true, you have to fuck up in order to get better I guess";;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:04 PM;"Like I spent a whole month learning C++ classes and implementing my own containers like vector, graphs, binary search trees, priority queues, and such";;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:05 PM;"It was such a pain because I was screwing up a lot of simple stuff, but it was fun at the same time";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:06 PM;"I still don't know it very well at all, mainly because I made doing stuff in C++ more of a side hobby rather than taking time out to learn it like I did with other stuff I really care about";;

Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:08 PM;Pragma once is the C++ way tho;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:08 PM;I know but I don't think all compilers support it even now;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:08 PM;and a lot of old heads just prefer the guards;;

Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:09 PM;Unless you are using a 20yo compiler;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:12 PM;easy to make mistake;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:12 PM;"Yeah, that's right";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:12 PM;harder to fix them as well;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:12 PM;It's also the time to split your code into .cc/cpp and .h files too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:12 PM;and on top of that the compiler takes forever to pull it all together;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-17 08:13 PM;yup;;

Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:17 PM;Fair enough;;
Marcello#4574;25-Sep-17 08:17 PM;It's like learning C before going to a higher level language;;

Otherwise the story is middling at best and the leads - Sephiroth especially - are not compelling. But! It's worth a play at least once, when you're more established.";;
GooeyGungan#8237;02-Oct-17 01:32 PM;"Yeah, I had heard about Sephiroth's melodrama-ness. Okay. Thanks for the advice!";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Oct-17 06:08 PM;It also depends on what you're looking for in the mods;;
Ripwars#9539;10-Oct-17 06:08 PM;Usually i look on nexus but theres bearly any;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Oct-17 06:10 PM;most of the good ones for FF were done on the original versions mainly;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Oct-17 06:10 PM;especially for IV - VI;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Oct-17 06:10 PM;I think PC version mainly has shit like bug fixes;;

Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 11:21 AM;IX doesn’t get all that much attention.;;
Blue#9087;16-Oct-17 11:41 AM;I think the reason why ff9 isn't more paid attention to is because it was released at the very very very tail end of the ps1 era;;
Blue#9087;16-Oct-17 11:41 AM;and people were moving onto ps2 by then;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 11:43 AM;Square Enix did it themselves by developing IX alongside both X and XI;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 11:43 AM;But for some reason making IX the only one not on the PS2.;;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 11:47 AM;I don’t feel that would really have benefited IX any.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 11:47 AM;"Graphically it would have, and IX may have even been the first voice acted FF.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 11:54 AM;And Square did it again by releasing 10 on Steam shortly after 9;;

Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:04 PM;But was otherwise true to it.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:05 PM;"...uh, what's the difference between it being a GameCube or PS2 game?";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:06 PM;Different aesthetics primarily.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:06 PM;"Not really, the GameCube is almost on par with the PS2, technically speaking.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:06 PM;Um;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:06 PM;"Almost because it's a bit more powerful, and multiplatform games used to look better on the GameCube.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:07 PM;I didn't say technically. I wasn't talking about the tech.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:07 PM;I said _aesthetically._;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:07 PM;Given it's nature as a nintendo console most games on it were 'cutesy' looking almost.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:07 PM;"So you are considering the exclusives, not the console itself.";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:08 PM;The console itself doesn't tell anything about how the games look like;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:08 PM;"The tech of it doesn't, no.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:09 PM;_However_ the aesthetics of most of its games do.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:09 PM;Just like any Nintendo console it has a reputation.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:09 PM;"There's no reason CC couldn't have looked like FFX, as you said, for instance.";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:09 PM;*exclusive Nintendo games.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:09 PM;Other than they wanted to stay true to the nintendo aesthetic.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:09 PM;Not GameCube games;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:10 PM;The GC has a lot more non-Nintendo games than you would think;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:10 PM;Why are you so pedantic and argumentative all the time.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:10 PM;FFCC is a non-Nintendo game.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:10 PM;It follows the aesthetic.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:10 PM;Because you keep insisting the GameCube has its own aesthetics.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:12 PM;"Which is false, what you are probably talking about Nintendo games for the GC instead.";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:13 PM;One example: Metal Gear Twin Snakes is the remake of Metal Gear Solid (PS1) and it was built on top of Metal Gear Solid 2 (PS2).;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:13 PM;It looks nothing like any other GC game.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:14 PM;"Maybe only a few, but not with the same aesthetics you are talking about";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:16 PM;It's a generalization.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:16 PM;"You know, those things that exist?";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:16 PM;You're also acting like games NOT made by nintendo for the system didn't match the aesthetic.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:16 PM;I countered that argument.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:17 PM;I'm not arguing that there aren't games that _don't_ have the 'nintendo' aesthetic.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:17 PM;But they're outnumbered enough to make a generalization.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:17 PM;"Sorry, but it was a poor and imprecise generalization then lol";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:17 PM;I don't think they are that outnumbered.;;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:18 PM;"Not really. It’s a generalization so it has issues as any generalization goes, but with that in mind it’s plenty accurate.";;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:19 PM;"Also as far as tech goes the GameCube was better than the PS2, though I haven’t looked into that claim enough to totally ascertain its veracity.";;

Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:24 PM;"Because, and this is the last time I'm saying this";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:24 PM;"I'm not saying exclusives outnumbered non-exclusives, or rather, i'm not saying nintendo games outnumber non-nintendo games.";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:24 PM;"I'm fully understanding what you are trying to say, I just think it's a really poor and imprecise generalization.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:24 PM;I was saying that even a substantial amount of third party titles still follow the Nintendo aesthetic.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:25 PM;As it is with _most_ Nintendo consoles.;;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:25 PM;You aren't really elaborating on why it is.;;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:25 PM;"You're just claiming it's a poor and imprecise generalization, and not going beyond that.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:26 PM;The whole conversation even started with FFCC.;;

Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:26 PM;"Beyond it being a generalization, and therefore subject to issues that exist with any generalization, what is the problem?";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:27 PM;"Still, I don't think it's fair to generalize it about the GC and I disagree with CC following that specific aesthetic.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:28 PM;"That's literally the design aesthetic of FFCC, though. Cute and stylized.";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:28 PM;> Cute and stylized.;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:28 PM;well;;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:29 PM;now that's a really vague style for me.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:29 PM;"The person that compared it to IX is literally right, it's the same style and it's a style that when compared to most nintendo titles, matches.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:29 PM;Or is at least similar enough to be a part of the trend.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:30 PM;"(For that matter, CC and IX share certain monsters and literal straight designs)";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:30 PM;"If cute and stylized is enough to define a game, then whatever lol";;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:30 PM;"They do, and that was me.";;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:31 PM;Marcel;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:31 PM;That's literally what defines a generalization.;;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:31 PM;And I don't see it really as an issue when plenty of people use realistic as a trait for Sony/Microsoft games.;;
Treble#5035;16-Oct-17 12:31 PM;"It's not perfect, it's just enough to be a trend.";;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:31 PM;"Also yeah, that falls right in line with my comment on beyond the issues inherent in a generalization.";;
Mirron#9949;16-Oct-17 12:32 PM;"So, again, we return to you backing up the claim in a meaningful sense as being wrong beyond it being a generalization.";;
Marcello#4574;16-Oct-17 12:34 PM;"It's Marcello, actually, and that's not a generalization, it's just being very vague when categorizing the games by aesthetics and defining a console with 661.";;

Dinoken2#0946;20-Oct-17 10:03 AM;Auto battle is designed to make grinding easier.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:03 AM;i'm just saying auto battle is not something that should be a selling point;;

Dinoken2#0946;20-Oct-17 10:04 AM;They're old games that require a bit of grinding.  Auto battle makes that more streamlined.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:04 AM;well we clearly don't agree on anything here;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:05 AM;Not necessary at all if you're​ really good.;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:05 AM;5 is grind city for class levels.;;
Marcello#4574;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;Auto battle in the Steam version automatically repeats your last blitz move;;

mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;you'd be spamming it anyways;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;it just makes it so you don 't have to manually input it every time;;
Marcello#4574;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;"Not really, otherwise it wouldn't be called autobattle";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;that is pretty good;;
Marcello#4574;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;But anyway;;
Marcello#4574;20-Oct-17 10:06 AM;Good morning/whatever to you all;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Oct-17 10:07 AM;Also autobattle just has your characters repeat their last action on repeat (unless they run out of MP then they switch to attack) so you can't really rely on that for anything aside from grinding.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Oct-17 10:07 AM;Good morning!;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:07 AM;similar to Persona 2 then;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:09 AM;Decent portion of the bosses in VI you can just whack at.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:09 AM;Not a ton of elemental resistances.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:10 AM;And if you clear out the dungeon beforehand you'll have plenty of levels to survive.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:10 AM;except when it decides to do that multiple party bullshit;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:10 AM;especially so when inactive party members don't get passive experience;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:10 AM;so you find yourself extremely underleveled unless you take your time to grind with literally every character in the game;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:11 AM;"i'm looking at you, tower of kefka";;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Oct-17 10:11 AM;Giving out of party party members EXP was one of the best gameplay improvements ever.;;

mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:12 AM;he's not really good;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:12 AM;Otherwise I switch it around a fair bit.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;but i like equipping him with STR espers so that his normal attacks hurt;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;then I get him to dual wield cards;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;"shit's cool, man";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;Setzer is decent for random encounter cleanup.;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;Does alright damage.;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;Basically all I used him for.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;sadly his str stat doesn't get really high;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 10:13 AM;But unreliable.;;

Rockinpanda#0475;27-Oct-17 10:10 AM;Hey guys! Im looking to get into final fantasy 4. Which version should i play?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 10:11 AM;PSP;;
4976#3971;27-Oct-17 10:12 AM;"I'm not too sure about this, but I believe the DS version is usually regarded as the tough version, and PSP is easier.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 10:12 AM;The PSP version is the definitive version;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 10:12 AM;"Difficulty isn't relevant, the PSP version is how it was meant to played.";;
Rockinpanda#0475;27-Oct-17 10:17 AM;ah ok. Thanks alot;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 10:18 AM;"just only play the main game, don't play interlude or the after years until you've had a break or you'll burn yourself out";;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 10:42 AM;Ds is also valid tho tbj;;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 10:42 AM;Tbh;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:05 AM;Valid;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:05 AM;you have a curious definition of the word valid;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:06 AM;"the DS version expects you to either plan out how to get the right augments in advance or grind to make up the difference, out of all FF games, you shouldn't have to grind in IV";;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 11:07 AM;I mean from what I understand the ds is the only version in the west that matches the difficulty of the original Japanese version;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:10 AM;"perhaps, but I'd say the overall experience is more important than just difficulty, the essentailly 16-bit nature along with character-specific mechanics that more accurately reflect the original version make it more definitive in my eyes, , also there's the fact that the DS doesn't even have the post-game, which is a shame because IV's post-game is actually somewhat enjoyable";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:10 AM;that the PSP version is also a Complete Collection helps too but I'm a sucker for a good deal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 11:11 AM;Has FF ever been a difficult franchise?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 11:11 AM;I mean lets be honest;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:11 AM;"oh, right, the PSP version also has party switching in the end and post game which while not reflective of the original is certainly nice";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:13 AM;"also it has auto-battle which is a must at the more tedious parts, , only real good thing about the DS version is that it lets you buy certain items you can't buy in the 2D version";;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 11:14 AM;I mean tbh the psp version of 4 is the one that I experienced first but if they want to play the ds version I would say that it's also plenty valid - I eventually played it to experience the voice acting and augment system when I wanted to replay 4;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:14 AM;I feel like the 3D version is better for a second playthrough than a first playthrough;;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 11:17 AM;That may be to be fair;;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 11:18 AM;To some the pixel style and lack of voice acting can be a deal breaker so that necessitates playing the 3d version;;
Treble#5035;27-Oct-17 11:18 AM;Overall IV is an experience that shouldn't be missed out on;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Oct-17 11:23 AM;"`To some the pixel style and lack of voice acting can be a deal breaker so that necessitates playing the 3d version`, , If that's the case you'd be better off not playing early FFs at all (or really any of them before X if you find voice acting necessary) because you'd clearly be looking for a kind of experience that isn't there";;
Ddeathscythe#9442;27-Oct-17 04:54 PM;"Just curious. But besides the fact that there are sprite limitations for SNES FFVI, is there a reason why the Magitek Armor from the very beginning of the game look so different  then the concept art?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:02 PM;because concept art is just the base design;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:02 PM;and you partially answered your question anyway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:03 PM;sprite limitations mean exact designs don't always work so you have revise them so that they don't look bad;;
Ddeathscythe#9442;27-Oct-17 05:04 PM;Got it! I am working on sprite project for FFVI. And I really liked the concept art for the Magitek armors and I was thinking that I would like to revert those sprites to be in more line with the concept art.;;
Ddeathscythe#9442;27-Oct-17 05:05 PM;"But wasn't too sure if the Magitek Armors were supposed to be visually different. As in, the soldier's Magitek Armors are supposed to be visually different than Terras.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:05 PM;nah it's just what they were able to resonably do at the time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:06 PM;"Magitek Armor in general was really tough on FFVI, if you've ever seen a mod with having them outside of the sections of the game that are supposed to have them";;

Ddeathscythe#9442;27-Oct-17 05:08 PM;Thanks for the heads up. I think the only mod that I would want to try is a visual one. But that is defnitely something I need to be aware of. And does those glitches apply to all versions of the game? OR just specific ones?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:10 PM;it would apply to the GBA and SNES version specifically;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:10 PM;since those platforms have the biggest limitions visually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:11 PM;you're limited on color depth;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:11 PM;limited with memory so only a finite number of graphics can be loaded at one time before you run out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Oct-17 05:12 PM;"It applies to any and every game that was made back then, not just this one.";;
Ddeathscythe#9442;27-Oct-17 05:13 PM;Thanks for the information. I am currently working on a sprite mod for FFVI on Steam. And I just wanted to check on any sprite related stuff I was thinking about working.;;

Toast#9118;11-Nov-17 09:42 PM;"So I started playing the mobile port of War of the Lions not long ago and was a little confused as to what was going on around when I beat the runaway rogues in the first chapter. When I look up a video on the plot (Oni Black Mage's RECAPitation), I see that apparently when the game starts there's supposed to be a cutscene explaining the basics of a 50 year war that ended in failure and caused 2 rulers to dispute over who raises the heir to the throne since the king died not long after. Instead it starts off by showing the cutscene of Delita riding on his Chocobo trying to locate Ovelia. Did I accidentally skip something or is the games first cutscene literally Delita riding his Chocobo?";;

Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:13 PM;I got like barely into act 2 the last time I played but that was less because of the battle system and more because my desktop crapped out;;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:14 PM;Makes sense. The gambit system actually feels good. I would have been fine with 15 if it was Gambit;;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:14 PM;Yeah I could understand that;;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:15 PM;Or allowed you to switch the party lead like VIIR is.;;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:15 PM;Right? I am really hoping that VIIR turns out okay;;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:15 PM;because if it's glorified 15 I'm going to be sad;;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:15 PM;Even T-0 did that playstyle better;;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:16 PM;Yeah;;

Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:20 PM;"You know, for your 3 playthrough. Ranger or knight might be a good upgrade for Luneth. You can spellblade with the various elemental blades or arrows";;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:21 PM;I might do Ranger;;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:22 PM;Because I'm planning on crossing Ingus into Knight since that seems to make the most sense as a progression;;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:22 PM;That it does. Scholar might also be interesting since they get double-bonus out of using items (unsure if that applies to using Staves as items);;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:25 PM;The Wiki says 'all items' used by a scholar have double potency. I suppose that would speak to staves if they can use them in battle;;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:25 PM;"Yeah, absolutely.";;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:25 PM;Either way I'll figure it out haha;;

Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:26 PM;That's true!;;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:26 PM;"idk how I feel about Sage. I think I want to keep my mages specialized, but I think Sage has better access to higher level spell charges";;
Ayz#1491;23-Nov-17 07:26 PM;"Memory tells me that they get 7 in every level, but that might not be right";;
Treble#5035;23-Nov-17 07:26 PM;It does - than red mage at least.;;

Malfred#1000;25-Nov-17 02:17 AM;Around 6 months;;

I enjoyed 12 on ps2 at the time just never ended up finishing it, also is it “too late” to start in ff14? I’ve been pretty hooked on p5 so I’d imagine I’d be trying to get these games around Christmas, hopefully on sale";;
Treble#5035;25-Nov-17 11:04 AM;"I would go ahead and say that you would probably enjoy The Zodiac Age, and it's never too late to start FF14!";;

Treble#5035;25-Nov-17 11:10 AM;"Oh, and also, XIV is free until level 20 for each base class and then you have to pay!";;
Shadynasties#3231;25-Nov-17 11:10 AM;Dang! Looks like I’ll be milking as much free content for 14 as I can lol;;
Treble#5035;25-Nov-17 11:11 AM;"That is unless they added a time limit; it's been over a year since I played and even longer since before I subscribed.";;
Shadynasties#3231;25-Nov-17 11:13 AM;I’m going to give it a go! P5 has been nailing the Turn based RPG itch I’ve been having so I wanna finish it before I start investing in other lengthy games. Been missing the JRPGs on Xbox and the Black Friday sale of PS4 was the spark I needed lol. Got the major 3 finally 😃;;
Treble#5035;25-Nov-17 11:14 AM;Aha P5 is a particularly long one too lmao;;
Shadynasties#3231;25-Nov-17 11:15 AM;"I’ve been enjoying it quite a bit so far, I just finished the first palace yesterday. I picked up Horizon, P5, berserk and the band of the hawk, nier, and kingdom hearts 2.8. So even just with those you could say I have my hands full lol";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Nov-17 02:29 PM;Then DS;;
Malfred#1000;25-Nov-17 02:51 PM;Then PC;;
Ayz#1491;25-Nov-17 02:52 PM;PC is worse than DS? That's rough!;;
Ayz#1491;25-Nov-17 02:52 PM;Wasn't sure if PSP held up without the Augments;;
Malfred#1000;25-Nov-17 03:17 PM;More that the PSP version is an enhanced version;;
Malfred#1000;25-Nov-17 03:18 PM;And the DS/PC version is a 3D remake;;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Nov-17 03:24 PM;I think the PSP version also has auto battle aswell if I'm not mistaken.;;
Ayz#1491;25-Nov-17 03:25 PM;Does PSP have different content? I saw a screenshot of Yang and Dark Cecil in the same party. I didn't think they ever met;;

Silverx1987#9781;25-Nov-17 03:29 PM;I-VI aside from III had GBA versions.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Nov-17 03:29 PM;FF4 also made it to the DS;;

Aruu#2066;27-Nov-17 08:00 AM;"That's why the FF series left Nintendo and went to Sony; FFVI barely got through the censors, and then FFVII was suggested and Nintendo just noped and wanted to tone it all down.";;
Deleted User#0000;27-Nov-17 08:01 AM;Nah. 7 was going to be for the N64 but that idea was quickly scrapped since of the limited size of cartridges;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Nov-17 06:48 PM;"Yes they stack, gear wise. Once you've mastered the ability, you don't need the gear anymore. To expand on the stacking: Let's say you have a headgear and accessory, both with Level Up, and you equip both. Instead of getting 1 AP towards Level Up, you will get 2 AP. (I think the amount doubles per gear, so 2 AP becomes 4, and so on.) You know you've mastered the ability when you see three stars.";;

action warrior#8892;02-Dec-17 03:40 AM;FF is a bit of a weird series to me because I can't guarantee any recommendations but I think 12 or even 13 would appeal to someone who specifically wants something like 10;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Dec-17 05:34 PM;I mean some of the more generic parts of the story like going on a journey with a character who blahblahblah super important;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Dec-17 05:35 PM;yeah ToS's story can be summed up as a kids version of FFX's story;;
Treble#5035;02-Dec-17 05:35 PM;Grandia 2's main similarity with X is that the primary antagonist group is the world's main religion.;;

Lily#9263;03-Dec-17 10:17 AM;nah I mean like kingdom hearts and the crystal chronicles etc;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 10:17 AM;"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is the one that immediately comes to mind regardless though, and I suppose if you count KH then that as well.";;

Leon#9542;03-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Tactics is best spin-off;;

Leon#9542;03-Dec-17 10:21 AM;Curtain Call on 3DS;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 10:21 AM;Both of them seem to be very good though.;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 10:21 AM;Based on a quick review check.;;
Leon#9542;03-Dec-17 10:21 AM;"I think they might be the same, just Curtain Call has more songs";;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 10:22 AM;From what I can tell they operate the same but Curtain Call has more songs and characters.;;

Lily#9263;05-Dec-17 03:53 AM;I don't think you do;;
Lily#9263;05-Dec-17 03:53 AM;Pretty sure the odds of winning are heavily stacked against you no?;;
Lily#9263;05-Dec-17 03:53 AM;In any case I lost it but I have a save from just before the match;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;05-Dec-17 03:54 AM;You're not really missing much by losing the tournament;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 04:20 AM;I think the only difference is getting the trophy;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 04:20 AM;I wasn't sure;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 04:21 AM;Also the odds of winning are 50/50 when it comes down to.it but Blitzball sucks and is hard so it may be more like 70/30 lol;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 04:21 AM;Having the Jecht Shot makes it easier but not by a whole lot;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;05-Dec-17 04:39 AM;Jecht shot makes it boring though.  I've been winning games by 5 to nothing;;

ShiggyDig#9513;07-Dec-17 08:39 PM;For FFXII are there any bad license combos for some characters? I'm playing the game for the very first time and I've been mixing the characters with licenses that fit their personalities or what seems to work with their design;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Dec-17 08:41 PM;not really no;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Dec-17 08:41 PM;game is pretty easy now so the job setups you choose really don't matter as much;;

ShiggyDig#9513;07-Dec-17 08:43 PM;Awesome ty;;
Malfred#1000;08-Dec-17 01:58 AM;The only bad choice in regards to licenses is which of your Mist attack upgrades you choose on the character with the Shikari job.;;
Malfred#1000;08-Dec-17 01:58 AM;Since that can lock you out of the license for the Yagyu Darkblade.;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;08-Dec-17 11:33 AM;"Yeah,  the disc will work fine.  Just that in order to use the codes, you'll need to setup a US psn account";;

Marcello#4574;16-Dec-17 10:23 PM;It won't be separate games;;
Marcello#4574;16-Dec-17 10:23 PM;All they are going to do is milk an entire game into several smaller pieces;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:12 AM;of course it will;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:12 AM;Not because of how they want to expand it or fragment it to death;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:12 AM;I mean Square has shown us in the past 7 years;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:12 AM;where their priorities are;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:13 AM;none of this is surprising at all;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:14 AM;glad it's FF7 getting it and not 6 though lmao;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:14 AM;I'd disown Square if they tried that bullshit with 6;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:14 AM;I think ultimately that FF7.R will be a _decent_ game.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:14 AM;But that they're kind of out of hand with it.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;I have more hope for the inevitable 5 and 6 remakes because they'll probably be more like 3 and 4.;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;"I really want them to not fuck this up, honestly, because I like VII so much and I can't pretend they aren't going to get greedy with this one";;

Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;I hope they **don't** remake any more games at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;because it was fucked from the start;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;outsourcing development;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;then that went wrong;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;so they had to bring it back in house;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:15 AM;they have no idea what they're doing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;should've just went back to telling people no;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;like they used to do;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;Agreed;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;They're going to remake the games. :HOHOHOHOHO:;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;They're going to probably remake all of the games pre-FFX before it's done.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;Let's be realistic.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;"idk man, fucking up VI is the last straw for me";;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:16 AM;Which is really sad if they actually do;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;"They want the games to at least have 3D graphics, and voice acting will be a plus.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;I'm not even an FF fan anymore;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;Because there ARE generations of gamers who do not want to play sprite games.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;There are people who will actively not play FFVI because it's got 2D graphics.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;"Square wants people, everyone, to play those games.";;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;"They won't touch any more games besides VII, I'm certain of this";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;well if Square made good games they wouldn't have to;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:17 AM;I think you're going to be surprised.;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;VI won't sell nearly as good as VII;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;Because whether you want to admit it or not Square does listen to their audience.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;"Nah.  X-3 is probably gonna happen, and they've implied they're going to remake VIII after VII.";;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;They are just remaking VII to build as much hype as they can;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;And the biggest thing other than VIIR that the audience wnats;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;VI and VII will sell just as well;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;wants;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;"And they are failing really bad at this, at least for the fans";;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;is remakes for v and vi;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;VI and V might get chibi style remakes eventually.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;they are the most requested;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;I think they'll be easy-peasy remakes for the Switch and maybe PS4.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;Maybe even as early as next year.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;VII is getting it first because it is easy to sell VII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;with little effort;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:18 AM;VI is one of the most requested for the fans;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;And that's it;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;But also Dino is right.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;who do you think is buying it?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Tales fans?;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;They said they're going to remake VIII and IX after VII if it sells well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Souls fans?;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;_Which we know it will_;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;"It won't be as ambitious as VII, that's for sure";;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;If anything;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;I hope it doesn't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;but it will;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;It will be like IV on PSP or DS;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Oh I expect it will get a full style remake.;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;I don't;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Or at least VIII and IX;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Nah;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:19 AM;Just not multiple titles.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;I entirely expect V and VI to be IV-style;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;I expect a 2D XV more than a fully remade VI;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;But also;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;not for 3DS;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;Probably for the Switch.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;It'll be for the Switch and PS4;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;probably look like Secret of Mana;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;Since the 3DS is dying down.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;The only reason VII is getting it first is because it is easy to sell VII and anything related to it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;even a piece of shit;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;Yes.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;I'm not even sure it's getting it first;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;It just got announced first;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:20 AM;it has nothing to do with VII as a game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;but the fandom backing it up;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;To ramp up series hype for FFXV.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;same with VI being a close second;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;I suspect V and VI get IV DS style remakes eventually on the Switch with PC/PS4 ports.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;Square doesn't care about their SNES games besides IV.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;We'll probably get another IV remake.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;IV will get a super duper remake one day;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;calling it now;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;See I'd assume it would be Switch only but then Secret of Mana is 100% the style they'd go with for eventual V and VI remakes and it's PS4/Vita exclusive.;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:21 AM;Like Dino said. I doubt it will get a full remake;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 10:22 AM;That _IS_ a _FULL REMAKE_;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:22 AM;Eh;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:22 AM;Not like VII;;
Marcello#4574;17-Dec-17 10:22 AM;Far from it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:22 AM;"It's a full remake to a DS style game, not a modern triple A style.";;

Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 05:48 PM;It was changed up for the new one but the 1v1 mode may be it's saving grace.;;
dustin789#4008;17-Dec-17 05:49 PM;didn't previous dissidias  already do 1v1 but with support? I must be missing something here;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 05:50 PM;"No, previous Dissidia's were basically 1v1 purely with the added option of an assist";;

Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 05:51 PM;I believe so.;;

Leon#9542;17-Dec-17 05:56 PM;like there's a rock-paper-scissors sort of thing going on with the roles that's not going to work with 1v1;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 05:56 PM;unless they've literally changed or added something that makes it intrinsically different.;;
Leon#9542;17-Dec-17 05:57 PM;"we'll see, but I doubt it";;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 05:57 PM;i think they probably had to have.;;

Leon#9542;17-Dec-17 06:00 PM;"there's no info I can find about 1v1 that isn't just the game has it, so I guess we'll have to wait for the game to actually come out to see if they changed anything";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:07 PM;"the game was not made for 3v3s, it was made for 1v1s";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:08 PM;and the 3v3s suck hard because of that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:08 PM;now I'm not saying 1v1s are going turn it into a diamond;;
Leon#9542;17-Dec-17 06:08 PM;"Original Dissidia was made for 1v1s, NT is a pretty different game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:08 PM;but it will definitely help;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:09 PM;because the current mechanics are godawful for 3v3s and it is pretty obvious that they mainly tested this stuff in a 1v1 setting;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:09 PM;given the lack of clarity when fighting and the shear amount of chaos there is in every match;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:10 PM;doesn't showcase any kind of skill being required other than finding someone who is worse at the game and killing them 3 times;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:12 PM;"no actual objectives outside of that either, so I don't see how the game was designed for 3v3s when the other 2 players on your team mean absolutely nothing most of the time";;
Leon#9542;17-Dec-17 06:12 PM;"Well I agree with all of that, I just don't think 1v1 is gonna be that much better of an experience and is going to come with a lot of its own problems";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:13 PM;I say 1v1s will be better in terms of having more drawn out fights;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:13 PM;yes the core mechanics are still the same;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:13 PM;but the fights will be clear in 1v1s;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 06:14 PM;it's why I found some kind of fun in the original Dissidias since they weren't exactly the best case example of amazing fighting mechanics either;;

A certain chest will give you the light blue upgrade. Then you travel to the Chocobo Lagoon, and dig in shallow water to get more Chocographs. Another chest in the open world will give you the Red Upgrade. This one can climb mountains. Go back to the forest, and two more spots open up. After a while, you'll get a chest that gives you the Dark Blue Chocobo. This can go swimming in any ocean (and climb mountains). Go back to the Lagoon, and you have the whole area to dig. Around the Red upgrade, you can start finding Chocograph Pieces. Six in total. Once you have all six pieces, you can get the mythical Gold Chocobo, and visit the Chocobo Air Garden.

Marcello#4574;08-Jan-18 07:09 PM;Making backups is against Nintendo's TOS though;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:10 PM;thats pure cheese;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:11 PM;besides you have to be a serious level pirate to draw actual litigation;;

Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:36 PM;noh I'm sorry;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:36 PM;now;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:36 PM;I ask in terms of FF3;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:36 PM;Is Black Magic really good towards the end game;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:36 PM;Mid-End game I mean;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:38 PM;"Sure, but you're better off with a sage for endgame";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:38 PM;to combine the best magic of all casters together;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:38 PM;but ain't sage basically red mage;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:39 PM;and can it cast the highest level of all magicks?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:41 PM;it can cast every magic;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:41 PM;and no it isn't like a red mage outside of that since red mages can use swords;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:42 PM;"regardless, Sages are better than the individual mage jobs separately because of this";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:42 PM;your white mage can be your black mage or summoner;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:42 PM;vice versa for your black mage;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:43 PM;currently I just have mechanic girl as white mage;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:43 PM;and Arc of circles as Black Mage currently;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:44 PM;well when you get access to Sage you can turn those two into Sages;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:44 PM;that's typically how a general playthrough goes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:44 PM;dedicated mages -> Sage;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:45 PM;everyone else -> Ninja;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:45 PM;or whatever you want;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:45 PM;in 3D version Ninjas aren't as OP as they were before so other options are available;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:45 PM;ninjas got nerfed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:45 PM;yup;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:46 PM;in the original NES version you would actually just run 4 Ninjas;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jan-18 07:46 PM;and just plow through the last bosses of the game;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:46 PM;ooooop;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;08-Jan-18 07:46 PM;is the ninja still good in the remake;;

Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:14 AM;"Hmm - not sure that's the type of question that they mean to see in channels like this buuuut my answer for this question is FFX. It's got simple, elegant gameplay and a good leveling system, a stunning story, stellar cast, and overall is up there as not just a FF great, but a RPG great as well.";;
Dinoken2#0946;09-Jan-18 07:25 AM;"My top 5 FFs, , 1.  VIII - Nostalgia, 2.  IX - Characters are perfect, also nostalgia, 3.  X - Story and gameplay are 👌 also nostalgia, 4.  XII - Story, characters, gameplay are good, 5.  V - Gameplay and characters.  Exdeath is one of my favorite villains.";;
hahapopi#7051;09-Jan-18 07:27 AM;"My top 3:, 1. XV: The characters and the tragic plot is what makes me absolutely love this game (Also the first game to make me cry), 2. X: The themes and Jecht as a villain really makes me dig the game, 3.  IX: Kuja";;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:59 PM;and Gau;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:59 PM;in seperate parties;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:00 PM;Gau is a beast if you let him leap back into the Veldt a couple times;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:00 PM;save your strong party with Celes for Kefka;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:42 PM;with gau you have to think of him as a slow roast;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:42 PM;the further in the game you go;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:42 PM;and once you a have bit of freedom of an airshipp you can go back and let him leap;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:43 PM;there are some incredibly strong enemy attacks you can coax out of that little fucker 😛;;
Dispo96#7127;09-Jan-18 09:43 PM;"I bet.  Don't really undersatnd him, just got him but the dude that came on the screen and explained it, seemed like a bit of work lol";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:44 PM;think of it this way;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:44 PM;when you chose Rage;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:44 PM;you are having Gau assume the role of that monster;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:45 PM;"that includes their moves, so a physical type attack and a special attack";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:45 PM;sometimes a crazy spell or something;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:45 PM;but he also assumes their status;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:46 PM;so if its a flying anemy he gains float status;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:46 PM;and in challenge runs he can be really useful;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 09:47 PM;since some of the Rage form he can assume will grant protect or reflect or what have you;;
Dispo96#7127;09-Jan-18 09:47 PM;Seems pretty OP in the long game.;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:35 PM;to what he is going to learn;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:35 PM;he Leaps;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:35 PM;and when he comes back he has more Rages;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:36 PM;go to his Rage screen;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:36 PM;and look at the list;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:36 PM;if you see a decent list;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:36 PM;move on and stop leaping;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:36 PM;ok perfect;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:37 PM;now when you are in a fight you choose Rage and pick a monster;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:37 PM;he will become that monster;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:37 PM;1 physical attack/one special or magic attack;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 11:37 PM;some status effect;;

4976#3971;11-Jan-18 08:06 PM;I guess it's like that so it's all together.;;
4976#3971;11-Jan-18 08:08 PM;It might be like that because of Redx2 though.;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;11-Jan-18 08:25 PM;"So for FFIII, I'm deciding if I should make my boy Arc Ninja Or Magus";;
4976#3971;11-Jan-18 08:27 PM;I'd lean towards Magus.;;
Sylvie#3260;11-Jan-18 08:27 PM;is there an item in FFV that improves Steal?;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;11-Jan-18 08:28 PM;Yeah I'm trying out Magus rn;;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;11-Jan-18 08:29 PM;"Seems pretty good, although I'm not sure if anyone here brought Magus to the end game";;
Jester Of Hemwick#8010;11-Jan-18 09:23 PM;"Just a question but is this team solid for FF3 currently (got blessed by Earth Crystal), , Luneth: Black Belt, Arc: Magus, Reina: Devout, Ignus: Ninja (might switch back to Knight but Ninja's pretty nice)";;
4976#3971;11-Jan-18 09:27 PM;Seems fine to me.;;
4976#3971;11-Jan-18 09:28 PM;"I believe my end game team was, Ingus: Dark Knight, Arc: Devout, Refia: Dragoon, Luneth: Magus";;
4976#3971;11-Jan-18 09:28 PM;Honestly as long as you have a devout for healing it'll probably be good.;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;11-Jan-18 10:24 PM;If you Rage into a monster that flies you will get float;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;11-Jan-18 10:25 PM;"There are very few Rages that give you an other positive status effects. Most however, will give either excellent elemental protection/absorption";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;11-Jan-18 10:41 PM;O;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;11-Jan-18 10:43 PM;i think Gau would be awesome if they updated his rage system;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;11-Jan-18 10:43 PM;i mean he can rage a King Gehemoth 😛 he should cast Meteor if he dies 😛;;

chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:45 PM;does ffx not have any exp leveling like the rest of the games?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;@chwoods#6004 not really no;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;the Sphere Grid is a little weird hey? 😛;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;yeah;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;very;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;it took me a while to get used to it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;think of it like a guidelines;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;you can follow it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;You wont see the traditional level cap of 99. There really isn't a true cap;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;or deviate;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:49 PM;the only cap on that system is literally filing the whole grid;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;but you can tell when you look around on it a bit;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;that there is a semblance of order;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;the -a and -aga spells being furhter along;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;and the locks on the crazy stuff;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;it really just allows you to make your characters in whatever fashion you like;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;what version are you playing?;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;"alright, but does the game become less linear?";;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:50 PM;the remaster on pc;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:51 PM;no unfortunalty not;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:51 PM;FFx is very linear;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:51 PM;its FREEDOM point is rather late;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:51 PM;alright;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:51 PM;dont let that detract from it thouhj;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:51 PM;is it just interesting for the story?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:52 PM;it seems to flow along with Yunas pilgrimidge right;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:52 PM;so in that sense the story only serves to get you to Yuna's end point;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:52 PM;but there is quite a bit of stuff you can do to remove that really bad linear taste;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:52 PM;once you get the airship;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:52 PM;is there a big open map like in any other of the games?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:53 PM;its not what you might call op0en world;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:53 PM;oh?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:53 PM;oh i know what you mean;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:53 PM;its not like the others;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:53 PM;i would say its more like really massive screen transitions;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;since FFX was the firest FF on ps2 you ahve to excuse them for trying a bunch of new shit 😛;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;"yeah, does it get better with x2?";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;ugh;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;im the wrong person to answer that;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;i dont want to prematurley give you a bad opinion of that game;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;XD;;
chwoods#6004;12-Jan-18 05:54 PM;yeah;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;12-Jan-18 05:55 PM;the combat in x-2 is alot of fun;;

Sylvie#3260;14-Jan-18 09:41 PM;What makes the other GBA remakes other than V and VI controversial?;;
Hardin#0379;15-Jan-18 12:31 AM;"Colors and audio were degraded. FFIV actually used the North American difficulty as a base instead of the Japanese difficulty, and provided players the option to choose their final party. So I guess it's controversial because some people disliked these changes? V and VI on GBA suffer the same color and audio degradation but it's extra content and better translations kind of makes up for it plus difficulty wasn't altered.";;
Hardin#0379;15-Jan-18 12:33 AM;FFI on GBA introduced MP for the very first time over the D&D spell slots which some people may dislike. I can't see ANY reason FFII on GBA would be disliked other than graphical and audio degradation.;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Jan-18 10:37 AM;"(And besides the other games that have been on GBA now have definitively better versions. But yes, that's right, it's the other versions of V and VI that are controversial. PlayStation versions suffer from PlayStation loading times, mobile/PC versions have odd graphics.

Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:37 PM;It's so much better than Tetra Master since there is some reward for it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:37 PM;i mean you can really break ff8 with cards;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:37 PM;i loved that;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:38 PM;I'm actually watching a speedrun with someone using cards to make game easy early;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:38 PM;im not a fan of speedruns;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:38 PM;XD;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:38 PM;fucking agdq;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:38 PM;im also very odd so take that as you will;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:39 PM;but it is true tho;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:39 PM;i mean you can beast mode disc1-3 with just 4-5 cards modded;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:39 PM;im unfortunalty at the point where im farming curse spikes ><;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:39 PM;the cards just dont do it after a certain point;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:43 PM;I sometimes struggle getting Siren and Edea's cards. The card group was interesting add. Although I'm not sure if I did fully go through Zell's crush quest.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:43 PM;oh yea the pig tailed girl!;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:43 PM;yea Edea's card and Siefers if you dont get it early were a big apin;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;but not nearly as much as Laguna and Alexander;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;"I know I see that scene in Galbadia when he see's her, he does push ups so fast that he puts the other trainees to shame 😆";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;XD;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;i used to hate Zell;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;he was the pre-Tidus to me;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;now i love him;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:44 PM;he can deal soooooo much damage;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;"Squall: They call me the machine, Zell: Machine as in breaks the machine";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;HAHA;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;That Research Hall scene was great;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;i just had a flashback of Burt Kriesher;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;XD;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;THE CALL ME THE MACHINE;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;XD;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;I don't really know him;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;oh dude;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;omg;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 07:45 PM;I see him in Dissidia NT though;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:46 PM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paG1-lPtIXA;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 07:46 PM;watch this 😛;;
Kaizer#1510;18-Jan-18 08:46 PM;Is it okay to sell all the treasures you find in XV?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 09:42 PM;"No, some sidequests require certain items/treasures";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 09:42 PM;that aren't unique;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:31 PM;Speaking of FF8 eariler. Did it have any more hidden scenes? I recall if Rinoa is in the party with Squal when heading back to Balamb to warn about the missle attack. There a scene with her seen on second floor during Garden mobile scene. Wondering if other characters have missible scenes like this;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:31 PM;i beieve there are a few;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:31 PM;i think there are some with Irvine for sure;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:32 PM;i dont know about the rest of them tho;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:32 PM;"i play ff8 100% sometimes, i havent touvhed the file in a while ill have to check 😛";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:33 PM;I don't usually have Irvine in my party. It's always Squal and Rinoa. I think 3rd I switch round who ever got lowest level;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:33 PM;i avoid Rinoa like the plague until later game disc 3;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:33 PM;for Angelo Search;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:34 PM;usually squall dead and selphie and zell do all the work in my files 😛;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:37 PM;Squal is mostly my OP main 😆;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:39 PM;hes too op;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:39 PM;if you ask me;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:39 PM;i mean hes the main protag so i get it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:39 PM;but he has two things about him that piss me off;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:39 PM;a) always 255% accuracy;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:39 PM;and since you pull the trigger for extra damage;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;you can never get a critical;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;not traditionally;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;b) since he has no need for accuracy;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;Hit-J is useless;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;and you always land attacks with status effects regardless of blind status;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;thats crap;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:40 PM;"Yeah, I found it odd having that accracy. I think the trigger meant to be his contorlable critcal";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:41 PM;indeed;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:41 PM;only Selphie ever gets to 255% on her own;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:41 PM;and at least with her you can crit with a good Luck-J;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:41 PM;Can perm boost states only at LV up though;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:41 PM;yea;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:41 PM;but its really sparse;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:42 PM;ike you have to literally level them up one by one to make it proportional;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:42 PM;which is ok i dont care;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:42 PM;but the way every FAQ i read for reference has GF listed is so boring;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:42 PM;Strength Magic or Defense;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:43 PM;but you can stat boos without leveling tho;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:43 PM;"Str-up, Vit-up etc";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:43 PM;highly farmable;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:46 PM;Isn't the Jp version the only version that allows access to Junctional Apocolipse? I know Ultimeche last phase draws them and cheat devices allows players to have access to it and it's OP with Ultima. Can heal from every element.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:46 PM;you cant junction apoc;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:46 PM;at all without PAR;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:46 PM;because you cant stock it with out PAR;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:46 PM;"Yeah, wondering if Jp version had access to it";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:46 PM;i dont think so?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:48 PM;nope it isnt as far as i can tell;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:48 PM;im looking at the JP version junction list;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:48 PM;its only castable;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:48 PM;for some odd reason tho there are guides that have its junction stats listed;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:48 PM;whiich is super weird;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:50 PM;It can be junction with cheat device. I've done it on my mess around runs when bored;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:50 PM;ok so you can stock it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:50 PM;but you cant obtain it normally;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:50 PM;so the answer is actually no;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:50 PM;since its only drawable and castable int he final fight;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:50 PM;and this game is so broken already its actually kind of pointless to even PAR it into your magic list;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:53 PM;True;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;i think if ff8 got a fresh coat of paint;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;with some gentle tweaks;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;and some added material;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;would be a phenominal game;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;I wonder if a remake is planned after 7's;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;you know they will;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;I would personally try to find a way to make the junction system more appealing to a wider range of FF fans;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:57 PM;its kind of the trend in all areas of the market;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:58 PM;not just games;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 10:58 PM;"I think VIII is great, but the system felt less fleshed out than materia was";;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 10:58 PM;"though I'd agree that without it, it wouldn't be the same";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;"I think some people didn't like the junction system which harmed it, but I actually like it.";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;i loved it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;i immediatly found the workaround for the draw thing;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;i dont know why ppl complain so much;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;FF9 felt strict but it was bareable with the story and characters;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;ff9 was a real standout;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;in terms of the progress of each game;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 10:59 PM;it was wonderfully stylized;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;there is a lot of attewntion to detail;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;I could never do the time attack for Excalibur 😆;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;I just don't have that RPG speed;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;FFIX is probably my personal fav of all the ps1 FFs;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;but VIII is up there;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;ps2*;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;oh 9;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:00 PM;sorry;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;my favorite is and always will be;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;Mystic Quest;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;Needs a remake;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;I enjoy all 7 8 and 9. I tend to get bored early game of 9 but I enjoy the last 3/4;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;yea i agree;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;theres alot of that optional missable stuff in disc 1;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;Mystic Quest honestly did what it said on the tin;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;introductory RPG that was simplified;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:01 PM;yup;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;I respect it for what it did;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;its just a classic;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;😛;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;And honestly I think it deserves a better reputation;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;i half think that most people never made it past the t-rex;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;so they go this game sux;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:02 PM;I think people just have never played it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;its old asf;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;llike me 😛;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;T-Rex is fun 😆;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;so youre prolly rifght;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;They just hear what they say on the internet and agree;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;t-rex is a skill check;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;XD;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:03 PM;haha;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:04 PM;"I think only flow with 8 is there is a risk being trapped in Balamb town. Say if party is bad, got next to nothing with potions and money. Player can't leave till they beat Fujin and Raijin.";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:04 PM;they canleave;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:04 PM;Zell's next door neighbour can let you out;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;takes 30 seconds;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;I don't think I knew about that;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;yea you just talk to the little prick;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;and he eventually aloows you to get out;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;i did think i was stuck there once upon a time;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;and when i did manage to beat them i forgot to draw Pand;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;Xd;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:05 PM;i was so pissed;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:06 PM;"Don't worry, I've had worse";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:06 PM;I littery played the game many times when I was young till end with many missable GFs;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:06 PM;I didn't know I can draw from bosses;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:06 PM;friggin Eden;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;Ultima and Omega weapon without Hero/Holywar or Limits;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;is a hell of a challenge;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;My mind read Siren as Scan for some reason I think and thought I had it 😆;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;oh no!;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;thats a shitty one to miss;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;Omega I need Heros. Ultima I'm fine with;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;since you need a level 100 Siren to refine Dark Matter out of 100x Curspe Spikes;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:07 PM;><;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:09 PM;"Yeah, after finding out I littery checked every boss for GFs";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:09 PM;damn ff8 end game is actually deep!;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:09 PM;😛;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;FF8 has a mythable lore that Squal died during the parade and disc 2-4 was all a dream;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;yea ive read it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;its quite convincing;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;😛;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;but i dont think its accurate;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;Only thing I wasn't getting is how his chest got healed;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;That's only plot;;

Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:10 PM;I wasn't sure about;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;Makes sense;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;i wish there was some change made;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;like i literally 2 shot edea;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;there should be an alternate sequence;;

Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;She was fun try play as till she leaves;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;yea;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:11 PM;now;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;you have touched my favorite idea;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;for 8;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;my only sincere wish while i played this game;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;was that i never got to play as the legacy characters;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;Edea and Seifer only?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;i wanted to use Kiros 24/7;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;his limit is SEX;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:12 PM;His Blood limit fun to use;;

Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:16 PM;I haven't tried but I could probably edit the available characters on emulator.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:16 PM;im going to record it;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:17 PM;I can sorta remember that awesome attack. I wasn't carried away with Ward's Hypoon though. Lagoon's Desperardo fun but it's a 1 burst damage if I recall;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:17 PM;yea;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:17 PM;Massive Anchor andDespo are 1 hitters;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:18 PM;it didnt make any sense to me though;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:18 PM;i mean;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:18 PM;they are on the ragnarok with you at the end;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:21 PM;Boo I can't upload it :(;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:22 PM;It's fine. Don't worry;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:23 PM;I can remember the game quite well.;;

Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:25 PM;Not my fav but I love how he uses them;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:25 PM;i think theres a little nbit of Yuffie in his limit break;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:25 PM;or was it Cid;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:25 PM;which one had the Limit Blood Brawl?;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:26 PM;Err...;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:27 PM;Can't remember;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:27 PM;its Cid;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:27 PM;Cid and Yuffie were my least used characters in FF7;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:27 PM;t it was called Big Brawl;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:27 PM;"It was alway Cloud, Vincent and Nanaki";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:27 PM;Yuffie and Vincent for me;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:28 PM;Vincents mechanics were fun;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:28 PM;and yuffie had a mini omnislash;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:28 PM;I'm not a fan of theives is why I don't use Yuffie but Doom was OP against Emerald if I recall. I managed it under time limit without maxing her Lv;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:29 PM;"Yeah, it was Doom I think";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:29 PM;i didnt know you could doom Emerald?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:29 PM;wtf;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:29 PM;"No, her Lv4 limit Doom. At Lv 99 she can tear it apart because they equil Lv I think";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:30 PM;All Creation is her l4 Limit;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:30 PM;There's a guide on GameFAQ by AwesomeSteve I think mentioned it. I could never beat Ruby and Emerald without it 😆;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:30 PM;"Ops, guess I got name wrong";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:30 PM;its 1 hit tho;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:30 PM;I thought one of them was Doom;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:31 PM;I must be mixing it up with another. I hadn't played in many months;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:31 PM;in any case 😛;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:38 PM;I wish zombie made it so I didn't get experience;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:38 PM;I could set up some really funny healing chains with Drain set to Status Atk-J;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:39 PM;Drain damage?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:39 PM;Yes if you've got drain on SA-J;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:39 PM;And you hit a zombid;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:39 PM;I recall Yunalesca is the Queen of Zombie and Death in FF10;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:39 PM;It heals the zombie and you take damage;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:40 PM;But if the whole party is zombie they can heal each other by attacking;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:40 PM;Like that  healing rod from ff6;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:40 PM;Seymour Mort was the king;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:40 PM;"Hadn't played preior to FF7. Except first one. I got bored a mop though with the grinding with a Red Mage, Knight, White Mage and Black Mage team";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:40 PM;Zombie + full life;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:41 PM;I have never played the original ff1-3;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:41 PM;Final Fantasy adventure was it?;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:41 PM;I just recall it was on android and it was about 4 crystals and garland with side quests. Even after grinding crazy hours I couldn't get far;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:41 PM;With the onion knight;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;"Well, the first three are worth going into just to find out the history and heritage of the series";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;I hear going 4 Knights would cheese the game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;But you'd be better off going with any other one;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;I've played almost every other;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;Just not the of Gameboy ones;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;"Those are the adventure ones, different than the first three";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:42 PM;I hadn't played 15 yet. The casing description sounds like another repeat of FF12.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;"I don't have much to say about them ,I don't know them very well";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;I won't play 15 because im an asshole;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;I'd say that's a disservice to both XII and XV;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;And I dontblike the direction Squeenix is going;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;They're vastly different games;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;Though I'd say XII is much better;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:43 PM;Especially the remaster;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:44 PM;"12 was mostly getting revenge and Ashe throne back, I thought it was kinda same with Noctis. But I can't say since I hadn't played, the trailers reclaim your throne was off putting for me";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:44 PM;yea i always get confued with those numbers;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;XV's story is reallly eh;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;I watched the episodes cartoon thingy;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;the game just doesnt appeal to me;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;"Worth a playthrough, but absolutely not more than half price";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;im too much of a classic fanboy;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;😛;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:45 PM;It's half finished;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;Haven't they been flooding it with DLC with multiplayer being one for like £60?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;Not that expensive;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;Might be $s;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;You can buy the season pass which includes all episodes and multiplayer for like 25?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;and there in lies the issue;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;a seasons pass;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:46 PM;....;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;"Yeah, the game should include all that shit within it";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;Sounds like EA with Battlefront;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;It's not that bad;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;i mean just finish the fucking game;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;and then release it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;But that's not to discount how bad it really is;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;They spent YEARS hyping XV;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;Released an unfinished title;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;No Man's Sky;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;"I think FF7 going to be in parts with remake, I don't mind long as it's not rent";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;rofl;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:47 PM;it is episodic;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;im not impressed;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;NMS was at least slightly justiable because indie dev whatever right;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;no nonononono;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;I never really took note of it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;it wasnt about being an indie;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;It's understandable though with the amount of 3D power they putting in. I read you can litterally explore the entirety of Midgar large scale model;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;it was blatant false advertising;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:48 PM;im sure its going to be very pretty;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;i just cant bridge the gap;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;the ARPG gap;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;ff7 was never an ARPG;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;so imho it shouldnt be now;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;I can imagine it being Kingdom Heart-ish with the game play;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;but square wants money;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;yup;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;And arpgs sell;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;its ok;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;look at the backlash from SW fans;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:49 PM;i would say FF are just as hardcore;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;"As long as they don't screw up the story, I'm gonna buy it";;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;EA are just pure greedy. SE are actually not like that from what I know;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;Not day one though;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;god no;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;SE is sort of a mixed bag;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;well i might just for the lawl;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;to stream it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;money to be made off those fucks on day 1;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;I mean I've been waiting years so might as well;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:50 PM;yea;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;same deal with kh3;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;"Come out, wait for reviews";;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;Buy if good;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;but that will most likely be a finished proiduct;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;most likley lol;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;i cant spell tonight;;
Nova#7705;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;£70 first day release ultimate package is pushing it personally with SE but it includes all future DLC being added so it understandable. Computing power gone insane since the old days;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:51 PM;yea;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:52 PM;"Ah, it costs 80 CAD to get a new base game nowadays";;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Jan-18 11:53 PM;"I remember when 1 pound was 2 canadian dollar, so 140 dollar day one release";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:54 PM;i hate our exchange rate;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:55 PM;lets see how far the dollar goes up when we win the Amazon bid 😛;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 11:55 PM;MUHAHAHA;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Jan-18 12:10 AM;When calgarians express surprise that we didn't win the shortlist;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Jan-18 12:10 AM;...;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 12:11 AM;i didnt even know Calgary was bidding;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 12:11 AM;its looking like Toronto is the big CDN pick;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 12:11 AM;i dont know if we can get it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 12:11 AM;we arent offereing the insane tax breaks the US cities are;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 12:12 AM;but from a distribution stand point it makes the most logical sense;;
Corneria#4076;19-Jan-18 03:59 AM;is ff12 a bad ff?;;
4976#3971;19-Jan-18 04:00 AM;Not at all.;;
4976#3971;19-Jan-18 04:00 AM;"Definitely different than all the rest, but I wouldn't really call any of them bad.";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:10 AM;12 is actually quite good;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:10 AM;Takes some getting used to if you are more familiar with traditional FF games;;
4976#3971;19-Jan-18 04:16 AM;It definitely has my favorite world of all the games.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Jan-18 06:30 AM;It's also Leon's favourite game ever;;
Marcello#4574;19-Jan-18 06:30 AM;"Hi, Leon :FFOC:";;
Leon#9542;19-Jan-18 06:33 AM;:FFOC:;;
Leon#9542;19-Jan-18 06:34 AM;"took me 3 minutes to see, I'm getting slow";;
Leon#9542;19-Jan-18 06:34 AM;"also yes, XII is best";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Jan-18 12:14 PM;XII is 4th best.;;
Bloom#5541;19-Jan-18 12:20 PM;X is my favorite;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 12:41 PM;so uh;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 12:41 PM;what should my rough stats in FFX be around zanarkand dome?;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 12:41 PM;because I swear to god most people say you don't need to grind but most common enemies kill me in two to three hits;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 12:54 PM;The dome can be a difficulty spike.;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 12:54 PM;I'd say to grind on the pathway leading up to it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 01:19 PM;"Wait- what?! The Dome a difficulty spike? Someone's having trouble?! I what? The only time I have trouble in X (even on replays) is *those two bosses*. One, TB-chan defeated recently, and one he has coming up. Hopefully you should know who I'm talking about. But yeah, at that point, I'm one shotting most enemies.";;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:20 PM;Depends how you play! The regular battles can be pretty tough once you hit the dome if you're not prepared;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:24 PM;I mean yeah I can just run from each fight and cheese my way through bosses but that's not really easy.;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:24 PM;Or fun for that matter;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:25 PM;"Uh let me put it into perspective, I'm at the dome and like 15 or so nodes away from having Yuna unlock Holy";;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:25 PM;"Okay, you could do with grinding a little.";;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:25 PM;What enemies are getting you?;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:25 PM;Exactly;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:25 PM;Ironically mostly the machines or anything that isn't one enemy;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:26 PM;Defender Z? Easy;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:26 PM;Ohhh they can be *tough*.;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:26 PM;those machinas? yeah I tend to die in like 2 or 3 rounds if they ambush me;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:27 PM;To help you can use provoke so they won't use their really hard hitting attack;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:27 PM;And demi works too! Given they have tons of HP;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;I do that to easily kill Defender Zs;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;"But yeah, if you are struggling, just drop back and grind a little.";;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;Those are the easy enemies;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;It's when they start having 2-3 turns before I can do anything that I'm screwed lol;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;oh yeah also;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;do I ever get access to the airship again?;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;Yeah! You do;;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:28 PM;After Yunalesca I guess? Kinda got spoiled lol;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:29 PM;"Aww no! :HAHAHAHAHA:  Yeah, after her.";;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:29 PM;"Alright, thanks";;
TB or not TB#6552;19-Jan-18 01:29 PM;Now to see if I can't cheese my way through her;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jan-18 01:30 PM;"Oh geeze, good luck, she *is* tough.";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 03:41 PM;i almost exclusively ran from Defender Z's;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 03:41 PM;they arent worth the AP when comparewd to the other machina that you can fight in the Dome;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:46 PM;"As a kid, I would run from battles from time to time";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:46 PM;"but now, I never run";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:46 PM;or almost never run;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:46 PM;"I mean, there are those exceptions";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 03:46 PM;it was more about the time to Ap ratio;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 03:46 PM;for me;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:48 PM;"as a kid, it was different reasons, ranging from back attacks/ambushes to low on heals/mana";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:52 PM;"In fact, my first playthrough of 4, I ran away *a lot*, and I had gotten to that one dungeon (trying to avoid the name, due to potential spoilers) near the end of the game with a boss rush. I was so underleveled, I had two options: Grind for countless hours against one enemy I could actually defeat (there was no leaving the area BTW), or start all over and abandon that save.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:54 PM;So I started over;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:54 PM;made sure not to run away so much;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Jan-18 03:54 PM;Had a much easier time;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 03:56 PM;Defender Z is the only enemy i ran from outside of an optional dungeon;;
Bloom#5541;19-Jan-18 04:37 PM;I always ran from battles as a kid. I can 100% guarantee that when I first played X (The first Final Fantasy I played) that I ran from most of the battles after I was halfway through the game.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:38 PM;ok;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:38 PM;did you just want to progress?;;
Bloom#5541;19-Jan-18 04:40 PM;"Yeah, as a kid I just wanted to get through the game. My hours for my first playthrough of X was only about 20-30 hours. My most recent playthrough was 60-70 though.";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:41 PM;sweet;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:41 PM;my last good file was over 300 hours;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:41 PM;haha;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:42 PM;Rikku only challenege takes forever;;
Bloom#5541;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;Holy! That's a lot of hours 😂;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;its artificially high;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;because you have to spend countless hours stealing;;
Bloom#5541;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;Yeah;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;was fun tho;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;thankfully it was in the original FFx release;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:43 PM;i dont think i could do it with the remaster;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:44 PM;dark aeons and all;;
Bloom#5541;19-Jan-18 04:46 PM;I've only played the remaster since I don't have a PS2 to play the original releases. But I'm probably gonna buy one soon even though most of the games I know I'd buy are already remastered for PS3 or PS4.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:47 PM;i have multiple copies of the games and i got another ps2 the other day at t a flea market;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:47 PM;if you ever need one and you arent in like Bangladesh;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;19-Jan-18 04:47 PM;ill send one;;

moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 02:53 PM;So in ff6 is there a reason I've stopped getting experience from fights?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jan-18 02:54 PM;you're probably on the Veldt;;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 02:57 PM;Yea?;;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 02:57 PM;Some random guy keeps popping up after fights;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:08 PM;that would be Gau;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:08 PM;😃;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:08 PM;hes a playable character you should guve him some dried meat 😃;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:08 PM;he might be hungry;;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 03:19 PM;"He's going to starve, I don't have any lol";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:19 PM;IIRC You can buy some at the nearby town;;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 03:19 PM;Ah;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:20 PM;"Gau, the Cait Sith of VI, or the Quna";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:20 PM;Quina*;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jan-18 03:21 PM;"yeah so, way Veldt works, no exp, though you do get AP, no original enemies, only ones you've seen before (i.e. are on your bestiary), Gau can learn monster techniques on the Veldt for use as rages, use learn to end a battle, then wait for him to come back by fighting more battles, but make sure there's space in your party for him";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jan-18 03:21 PM;rages are sort of blue-magic but it's more like they turn him into that enemy in terms of AI;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jan-18 03:21 PM;so you lose control of him for that battle;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:22 PM;Think Kimahri but less cool;;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 03:23 PM;Ah;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:31 PM;@moshi..mo#4014 think Kimarhi but better;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jan-18 03:31 PM;I really hated the Veldt shenanigans;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:31 PM;lol Kimarhi you have to develop way farther to even be a remote match for how good Gau is;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jan-18 03:31 PM;Also Gau;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:31 PM;Gau is awesome;;
Marcello#4574;26-Jan-18 03:31 PM;It takes a lot to make him any decent;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:32 PM;that it does;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:32 PM;but it takes very little to make him useful;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:32 PM;mny of his early rages come with slight protection or float;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:32 PM;and many have decent spells and abilities;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:36 PM;You must be smokni something to think Gau's useful;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;i am indeed smoking something;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;and for someone who plays FF games to challenge myself;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;Gau is a laugh;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;hes actually so fun to Rage with;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;"So, you're saying he's the RIkku of VI?";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;um;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:45 PM;no hes definitly kimarhi;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:46 PM;i mean objectively yes;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:46 PM;Gau is shit;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:46 PM;but when you factor in what encounters he has to learn from before the Veldt he is less than ideal;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;26-Jan-18 03:46 PM;and most of them only giving either float or berserk status;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:48 PM;Ha!;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 03:48 PM;Gau *is* shit;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jan-18 03:52 PM;there are definitely some rages that are situationally useful;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;26-Jan-18 03:53 PM;but that doesn't justify how obtuse the mechanic is overall;;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 03:56 PM;"I mean, free party members why not";;
moshi..mo#4014;26-Jan-18 03:56 PM;I'll mess around with it what's the worst that can happen;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jan-18 04:00 PM;Yeah.... **gets war flashbacks**;;
Vaan#4529;27-Jan-18 11:25 AM;"In FF V, is it possible to get the Gil turtle as a bestiary entry in the sealed temple?";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;27-Jan-18 11:42 AM;Hmmmmm;;
moshi..mo#4014;27-Jan-18 01:31 PM;How is gau bad? He starts off with a bunch of different stuff and hits about as hard as everyone else?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Jan-18 01:36 PM;"He's basically perma berserk + Confu (minus hitting allies), and I just never liked that kind of combination";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Jan-18 01:36 PM;"Or simply put, use one of his rages, and you lose control of him";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Jan-18 01:37 PM;It's also why I don't like Vincent's limit break;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Jan-18 01:39 PM;Mog's Dance is slightly better/more bearable cause better options (IMO).;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Jan-18 01:41 PM;"Plus, I just never really liked Blue Magic";;
moshi..mo#4014;27-Jan-18 01:43 PM;I haven't minded so far;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Jan-18 01:43 PM;Gau is okay;;
moshi..mo#4014;27-Jan-18 01:43 PM;Just free damage;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Jan-18 01:44 PM;He's not the WORST unit;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Jan-18 01:44 PM;But he can do hella damage;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Jan-18 01:45 PM;"To be honest,I never really payed attention to the Tutorial on how to use his Rage";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Jan-18 01:45 PM;"Then again, who the hell pays attention anymore";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Jan-18 01:46 PM;You say something? Sorry I wasn't paying attention;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Jan-18 02:54 PM;you are right that FFV doesn't allow you to verify integrity anymore;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Jan-18 02:54 PM;Have you tried closing and reopening the game?;;

Obi#8861;27-Jan-18 06:22 PM;Do you think I could post this question on the FF reddit ?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;27-Jan-18 06:22 PM;absolutley;;

Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 06:34 AM;"In FFV, I cannot get down the wind drake after I am joined by Krile and bound to Exdeath's castle";;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 06:34 AM;I found a topic on the steam discussion with the same problem: https://steamcommunity.com/app/382890/discussions/0/360670708794507259/;;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 06:34 AM;But I cannot verify game integrity: https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285480625820008448/406914280139653150/unknown.png?width=446&height=435;;
Marcello#4574;28-Jan-18 06:35 AM;That's odd;;
Marcello#4574;28-Jan-18 06:36 AM;Uninstall the game and then install it again;;
Marcello#4574;28-Jan-18 06:36 AM;You won't lose your saves;;
Marcello#4574;28-Jan-18 06:37 AM;"Also note you can't land on any place, you need to land on the grass";;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 06:44 AM;"I already tried uninstalling and re-installing, twice, once on my SSD and the other time on the my HDD";;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 06:45 AM;"And yes, I am aware of what and where the drake can land, I even went on to look at a walkthrough to see what they did after Krile joins t he party, and I went to the exact same spot, it didnt work";;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 06:45 AM;I also tried rebinding the key to another key but it didnt solve it either;;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 09:27 AM;"Another idea I received:, Try plugging in a controller. I'm sure a button will work on it. When I started the game I could not land the sea ship without a controller.";;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 09:27 AM;I'll try that;;
Obi#8861;28-Jan-18 10:30 AM;Doesnt work either :/;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;28-Jan-18 10:42 AM;It is very strange that FFV doesn't allow integrity verification;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;28-Jan-18 10:51 AM;I know;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;28-Jan-18 10:51 AM;I looked around for a solution last night while I was getting my genji armor;;

XV is good but was incomplete at launch, the situation is much better now because of various updates and dlc (if you get it, get the Royal Edition on console or the Windows Edition cause they include all the stuff so far) and WoFF is legit good";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 10:56 AM;it's gotten worse;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 10:56 AM;or well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 10:56 AM;WoFF is good but that's a spinoff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 10:56 AM;but yes you should play it anyway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 10:56 AM;XV? nope avoid it like the plague (which is gonna be hard because Square is aggressively milking it);;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:56 AM;Type-0 isn't new on PS4 and is quite old but that's a fun game as well;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:57 AM;Dissidia NT is kind of jank rn;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;Fuck so all the new ones suck...;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;Is remake of x on ps4?;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;no one said that though?;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;Lemme ask google;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;we both said WoFF is good;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;Spinoff as in?;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:58 AM;as in not XV or whatever;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:59 AM;Yeah I heard good. But was hopeful for a more.hype tbh lol;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:59 AM;not numbered;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:59 AM;not mainline;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 10:59 AM;etc;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:59 AM;Fair enough;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 10:59 AM;Orry running on 3 hours of sleep and the flu lol a little loopy;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:00 AM;Oh snap there is a x/x2 on ps4;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:00 AM;I never played x2;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:00 AM;"but yeah I'd say XV actually is a very fun game, it's biggest issue was just large chunks of the story and game missing on release which has been addressed";;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:00 AM;Type-0 is a remaster of a PSP game but it's also a good game;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:00 AM;yeah X/X-2 on PS4 is nice;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:00 AM;there's a XII remaster too;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:01 AM;and straight ports of VII and IX with built in cheats for some reason;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:01 AM;What's straight ports mean;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:02 AM;I literally bought a ps4 3 days ago lol;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:02 AM;"well not really remastered or significantly improved or anything, just the same game as it was before";;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;as opposed to X and X-2 which are graphically upgraded quite a lot and have the International edition content;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;That's just on the ps store? Or they sell physical copies;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;Gotcha;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;VII and IX are PS Store only;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;X/X-2 and XII are available physically;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;as are XV and WoFF and the other actual new games of course;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:03 AM;I still have my PlayStation with ff7 in my garage I wonder if she still runs;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:04 AM;Shit I gotta hit up this PlayStation store see if any of the old rpgs I have are available;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Feb-18 11:05 AM;"The Final Fantasies available on PS4 are... VII, IX, X, X-2, XII, XIV, XV, WoFF, Type-0";;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:06 AM;Dissidia NT too if that counts;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Feb-18 11:06 AM;"Oh, I guess it does because I counted spinoffs";;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:07 AM;the gaps where VIII and the XIII trilogy should be in that list bother me lol;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:07 AM;ports and remasters please Square;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Feb-18 11:10 AM;"Yeah, you're not the only one that thinks that way lol";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:10 AM;Those games can probably be excused on the bases that they'd make a total of like five bucks for squeenix;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:11 AM;At least 8 is somewhat popular with hardcore ff fans;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:11 AM;VIII would sell on nostalgia alone and XIII has a pretty solid sub-fanbase as well;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:12 AM;There aren't enough XIII fans to sell enough copies to make their money back;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:12 AM;off of remasters? idk about that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:12 AM;"VIII might do it, XIII isn't exactly nostalgic, it's not even 10 years old";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:13 AM;And PS3/Xbox 360 isn't exactly what you'd call a retro console;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 11:14 AM;they would never be considered retro;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 11:14 AM;but they are old consoles;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Feb-18 11:15 AM;like 15 years old;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:16 AM;"It puts the games in a weird situation where they're old but they don't *feel* old, so consumers just end up feeling confused and don't buy it";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:16 AM;"Like, PS1 is very definitely old and retro, an 8 remaster would probably make an okay profit";;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:16 AM;"idk about no sales though, I got curious and looked and on Steam for example XIII has more owners than any other FF save for XIV and VII, and that's with the notoriously bad port";;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:16 AM;so it definitely has an audience I think;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:16 AM;But for 13 your average Joe Dickhead would be like Didn't this *just* come out?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:17 AM;"And besides, what's there left to fix? Square fingers? Maybe some HDR and 4K support?";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:17 AM;"Okay I guess if they actually took a second stab at, yknow...*porting* 13-2 I'd appreciate it";;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:18 AM;I would pay 10$ for a 8 remastered;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:18 AM;"For real, if a 13-2 remaster comes out that just runs properly when you hit the go button would be an improvement on the steam port of 13-2";;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:18 AM;No more then that though I don care that much to card battle;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:19 AM;I think VII and IX go for a bit more than 10;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:19 AM;not a lot more but a bit;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:19 AM;15;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:19 AM;Just seen 7 there;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:19 AM;7 I would pay 15 bux for especially when I can sell my.pjusical copy of 7 for 100$;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:19 AM;lol the steam port of XIII-2 was a travesty and I still find it hilarious how then the steam refund system comes out and SE is like oh shit as Lightning Returns for Steam mysteriously gets delayed and isn't heard from again for a long time;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:20 AM;Perfect condition and case perfect still;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:20 AM;cause they need to actually make it work this time to keep the money;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:20 AM;13-3's port is actually *fucking fantastic*;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:20 AM;yeah it is;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:20 AM;It's like...the only good pc port;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:20 AM;cause they actually worked on it lmao;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:21 AM;From 13-2 being actually unironically *literally unplayable* to 13-3's buttery smooth 60fps;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:21 AM;steam's refund system was a good idea I guess;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:21 AM;now games have to work or the money's going back;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:21 AM;Yeah I blame nobody for refunding 13-2;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:21 AM;When I buy a game i expect it to work;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:22 AM;If I have to finish porting your game when I buy it then you need to be paying me;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:22 AM;I'm actually really sad about it cause XIII-2 is my favorite of the three and one of my favorite FF games period;;
Lillelaps#8753;24-Feb-18 11:22 AM;but with the port they were apparently just like does it start up? ok good release it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:22 AM;Squeenix doesn't feel that way;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:22 AM;As we can see;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:22 AM;Ehhh contract says we have to port 13-2 to pc. Oh it works on toriyama's laptop? Great ship it.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:23 AM;And then it was never looked at again;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 11:26 AM;What's port mean exactly;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:27 AM;To take a game developed for a console and make it work on another console/on PC;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:29 AM;"In this case, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of 13-2 worked fine";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:30 AM;"But when it was released on PC, the game simply does not work. You hit Play, the game runs for a bit, and then crashes.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:30 AM;And that's if you're very very lucky.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:30 AM;There are other issues.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:30 AM;1) Game crashes when saving while steam cloud sync is enabled.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:31 AM;2) Any audio configuration that isn't 2 channel stereo or 5.1 channel surround produces an incredibly loud buzzing noise.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:31 AM;"3) Rain has a white texture, making rainy scenes almost impossible to see.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:32 AM;"4) The game has a built-in frame limiter, which causes massive framerate dips regardless of what kind of hardware you have in your rig.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:33 AM;"5) The game executeable is missing a flag called Large Address Aware, which means that as soon as the game attempts to use more than 2GB of RAM, it crashes.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Feb-18 11:34 AM;Final Fantasy 13-2 for Steam is just straight up *not finished*. I don't think it's a stretch to call it *literally unplayable* without a hint of irony.;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 12:07 PM;Jesus;;
TNSxPAPA#8430;24-Feb-18 12:07 PM;That's pretty pathetic for such an insanely huge company;;
Malfred#1000;24-Feb-18 12:37 PM;The size doesn't matter much;;
Malfred#1000;24-Feb-18 12:38 PM;"But it is pathetic for such a big company, when it has studios with a lot of PC dev experience";;

Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:02 PM;well the Steam versions of XIII-2 and Lightning Returns include all the dlc so that's a nice bonus;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:02 PM;especially for LR since it's a good port;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:02 PM;ooo nice.;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:02 PM;if you play XIII-2 on ps3 again I recommend grabbing the story dlc at least;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:02 PM;"i see there's a PC version of XV coming, but seeing how i've already got the game and the season pass on PS4, i'm assuming it's not going to be worth the cost.";;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:02 PM;i have them from my original ownership.;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:03 PM;"lol yeah, and even then they're releasing the Royal Edition of XV on console which has all the dlc so anyone buying the game now gets everything regardless of platform";;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:03 PM;I can't even play XV on pc though lmao I have a shitty laptop from years ago and XV is going to make it explode;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:04 PM;i'v ehad XV since launch.  i've just been stuck in Chapter.... 2?  3?  the one where you reach the smaller city and meet Gladio's sister.;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:04 PM;XV had the bad luck to come out around the same time Fallout 4 devoured my soul.;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:05 PM;I always have a hard tiem trying to play games like the modern Fallouts lol;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:05 PM;I just end up running around being a dick to all npcs and goofing off;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:05 PM;the storyline gets sidelined;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:06 PM;"*nods* the trick for Bethesda games is, do the main story first, only doing side quests that you get along the way that dont' take you too far off course.  Then once you've gotten that out of the way, you go into Explore/Loot/Goof mode and see all the little details the devs put into things that most games overlook.  Bethesda don't have the most original storywriters, but their world designers are the best out there.";;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:07 PM;yeah the worlds are neat;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:07 PM;I just love abusing npcs and glitches;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:07 PM;"also Fallout 4 put in Settlement Building, which i've sunk 200 hours alone into, bulding my perfect community of settlements across the wasteland.  i may have a problem.";;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:08 PM;lol if it's fun it's fun man;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:08 PM;I've probably put a triple digit number of hours into Devil May Cry 4;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:08 PM;so I know the feel I guess;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:08 PM;"but Dark Pixel's latest review has kicked me in the FF zone, and I feel like I should *finally* beat XV before i move onto replaying older titles.  I've got X and XII HD begging for attention, too.  not sure which order to play.";;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:10 PM;does the order really matter? they're all separate;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:10 PM;except the obvious X-2 and XIII sequels;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:10 PM;"XV-related question.  I'm usually a 100%, at least in terms of questing/story if not achievements.  and right now i'm so bogged down in side quests and hunts, I'm already 10 levels over the next story quest.  should i just start ignoring the side stuff?";;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:11 PM;some of it's interesting (the jeweler/reporter) and others are ... not (the scientist and her samples).;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:11 PM;"Bethesda doesn't know what they're doing with Fallout and they never should have gotten the IP, their Fallouts don't fit the spirit of Fallout, , and they haven't had a truly good writing team since Morrowind";;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;lol speaking of that I'm playing Fallout 1 on Steam;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;"or at least attempting to, I get destroyed so much";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;I hope you're using Fallout Fixt >_>;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;"as for XV Idunno man, I usually just do whatever I currently feel like";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;more seriously you should look up a build;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;"i would have agreed on 3, but i find myself really liking 4, even if its a step backward from New Vegas.  Honestly, i find Morrowind painful to play, to this day.  Oblivion was crap.   Skyrim I thought was decent, main story aside.";;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;I'm not spoiler wary so I looks up missable lists to make sure I do what disappears;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:12 PM;that game comes from the era of RPGs where builds were important;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;"`Honestly, i find Morrowind painful to play, to this day.`, , Sad.";;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;*nods* Used Fallout Fixt and find a good Sniper build for your first time.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;I'll grant Daggerfall has better gameplay than Morrowind;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;but Morrowind has never really bothered me;;
4976#3971;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;"Morrowind is great, but I am atrocious at it.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;though I do use some changes;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;like State-based HP;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:13 PM;and Madd Leveler;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:14 PM;oh dont' get me wrong.  Morrowind has a great story and world.  but the teethgrindingly slow walking speeds?  Incredibly limited travel services?  FPS style melee combat with a hidden die roll mechanic meaning you still miss even when you hit?  No Magicka Regeneration over time?  GAH.  I'm waiting impatiently for Skyblivion to finish.;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:15 PM;sorry Skywind.;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:15 PM;"Skyblivion, too, but i want Skywind *much* more.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:15 PM;the travel services were part of the charm;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:15 PM;the die rolls were normal back then;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:15 PM;the lack of magicka regen was also normal for TES games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:16 PM;and is not a problem if you use potions like the devs intended and don't just hoard them;;
4976#3971;27-Feb-18 12:16 PM;The biggest problem with those is if you go from Skyrim to Morrowind rather than the other way around.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:16 PM;*shrug* wasn't a problem for me;;
4976#3971;27-Feb-18 12:17 PM;It is for a lot though.;;
4976#3971;27-Feb-18 12:17 PM;I definitely had that problem at first.;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:18 PM;"i'm an old school gamer but i'm a late comer to Fallout/TES.  I was a Baldur's Gate/Infinity Engine man back in those days.  I started with Oblivion and Fallout 3, though i've gone back and played the others.";;
4976#3971;27-Feb-18 12:19 PM;The only Baldur's Gate I've played was Dark Alliance on the PS2.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:19 PM;HAHAHA;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:19 PM;barely a Baldur's Gate game lmao;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:19 PM;those werne't BG games. those jus tused the names.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:20 PM;"Daggerfall is the best TES game in terms of gameplay, Morrowind has the best world and lore (unless you count Shadowkey), Oblivion has the best side quests, Skyrim is shit, ESO manages to be a jack of all trades and actually has a pretty interesting story in places but it's an MMO which I'm fine with but, you know";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:21 PM;Fallout 2 is the superior Fallout;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:21 PM;Baldur's Gate's only flaw is that it runs on AD&D;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:21 PM;"I disagree on Skyrim, but otherwise, I agree.   , , New Vegas is probably the best objective Fallout game, for me, overall, though I've put more hours into FO4 than any of the rest.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:22 PM;I'll recant a bit: Skyrim has great atmosphere;;
4976#3971;27-Feb-18 12:22 PM;"I've only really played FO4 because I don't like using VATS and the shooting in 3 and NV sucks, or I suck at it.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:22 PM;but yeah I'm really not a fan of AD&D;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Feb-18 12:22 PM;I didn't like 3 cause it was kinda short;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:22 PM;I liked Skyrim but I mostly just went around pickpocketing every single npc and hoarding loot;;
Lillelaps#8753;27-Feb-18 12:22 PM;I haven't finished the story still;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:23 PM;"I grew up on 3.5 and moved to Pathfinder, I can deal with it, I'm even actually learning the system, but I don't like it";;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:23 PM;"FO4 *would* have been a great game if they hadn't removed Skill Checks from all the dialogues, and given you such a strict character background it was impossible to really play different characters.  In some ways FO4 was more of a JRPG in terms of character progression.   It's really odd.";;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:23 PM;"AD&D is horrible an di grew up on it.  i'm a Pathfinder man, all the way now.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:26 PM;"man if they made video game adaptations of all the Pathfinder APs like they are for Kingmaker, hell even for the side modules, and the Pathfinder Society Scenarios, I'd be very happy";;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:26 PM;Hear hear.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:27 PM;Dream version: Each adventure unlock in original release order (since real world date corresponds to Golarion date) so that you can see all events as they occur in world.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:27 PM;Though they'd have to uh;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:27 PM;"@Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440 FO3 was made by its DLC.  The main game was meh, but The Pitt, and Point Lookout as well as the revised ending of Broken Steel elevated the game in my mind.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;change part of Rise of the Runelords so that the world destruction scenario can't occur;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;RotR would be awesome as a video game.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;I was running it for a group;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;but we stopped mid-chapter 2;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;just ran out of time;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;plus some players graduated;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:28 PM;sad;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:29 PM;😦 my game never finished either.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:29 PM;my pipe dream is to run all Golarion content in order for an extremely large group;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:29 PM;but that'll never happen;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;27-Feb-18 12:29 PM;even ignoring the fact that content releases faster than it can be played;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:30 PM;"i'm going to repost my earlier question since it got overlooked in the side-discussion.  XV-related question.

Thelitedragon#4507;27-Feb-18 12:38 PM;So go ahead and beat the game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Feb-18 12:39 PM;And then come back for the hunts and post game bosses and dungeons;;
Barachiel#7845;27-Feb-18 12:40 PM;"PERSONA!!!!  Um sorry.  Follow-up question, and one that's a bit odd.  Does that make sense narratively?   right now it' sjust a road trip with the bros, and while there's a disaster happening, that ticking time clock that most RPG usually have (Literally in LR: FFXIII) hasn't surfaced yet.";;

Lillelaps#8753;28-Feb-18 10:05 PM;I'd think you'd need to ask it first;;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:06 PM;Why is my monks evasion so low? The monsters miss more on my warrior than him and I'm wondering why. His constant damage taking makes mana consumption brutal;;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:07 PM;In final fantasy 1 dawn of souls might I add;;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:26 PM;"Better yet, why does my warrior have higher evasion than my monk???";;
Thelitedragon#4507;28-Feb-18 10:27 PM;The monk is what's known as a investment class;;

Thelitedragon#4507;28-Feb-18 10:28 PM;"Like the thief, he starts pitiful";;

Thelitedragon#4507;28-Feb-18 10:28 PM;"At higher levels, the monk outclasses the warrior in damage";;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:29 PM;He certainly does.;;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:29 PM;"Well, I guess my next question is asking if I have the best gear for my party or not.";;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:29 PM;I dunno how you wanna go about answering that;;
Thelitedragon#4507;28-Feb-18 10:29 PM;The monk usually does not need much equipment;;

Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:32 PM;Mhm.;;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:34 PM;So I guess I'll knock the best equipment one by one. What's the best equipment for Knight?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;28-Feb-18 10:36 PM;The best stuff in the game is usually found in those dungeons;;
Thelitedragon#4507;28-Feb-18 10:36 PM;The last one has 40 floors;;
Soul#0549;28-Feb-18 10:38 PM;"I mean I figured where they'd be, but I wanna check if I have them already or not.";;

Malfred#1000;03-Mar-18 01:05 PM;It depends entirely on how much of the optional side stuff you end up doing on each.;;

Thelitedragon#4507;03-Mar-18 04:04 PM;uh;;
Lillelaps#8753;03-Mar-18 04:04 PM;It is not though. The PSOne Classics line was literally the ps1 games with no changes whatsoever. Not ports like FF7 and FF9 on ps4;;

Thelitedragon#4507;03-Mar-18 04:05 PM;"PS1 Classics don't exist on PS4, only a limited amount of PS4 exclusive PS2 Classics with Trophy support";;

Malfred#1000;14-Mar-18 01:34 PM;The Soulsborne games aren't hard per sé.;;
Malfred#1000;14-Mar-18 01:35 PM;They just punish failure a bit more severely than most other games.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Mar-18 01:37 PM;"I wouldn't say that, I'd say they unfairly punish you, cause you were supposed to know that one enemy was supposed to swing five times in a row the first time you encounter them, or that one enemy will roll down a giant boulder, crushing you, with no way of knowing it's coming.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Mar-18 01:37 PM;And then call it hard;;

PotaBo#0031;14-Mar-18 01:44 PM;I do okay at them though;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;14-Mar-18 01:45 PM;The Soulsborne games _aren't_ like that though. They usually let you encounter enemies alone for the first time in open areas so you can watch them and learn their patterns.;;
Lillelaps#8753;14-Mar-18 01:46 PM;Soulsborne wants you to be careful and deliberate in your actions;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;14-Mar-18 01:46 PM;And then take advantage of the opportunities when they occur.;;
Lillelaps#8753;14-Mar-18 01:46 PM;You can't just run into every encounter and mash attack;;
Malfred#1000;14-Mar-18 01:49 PM;"Yeah, they are very fair all told";;
Malfred#1000;14-Mar-18 01:50 PM;The expectation isn't that you know that there's an enemy behind that corner;;
Malfred#1000;14-Mar-18 01:50 PM;"Just that you learn from the mistakes you made, when it surprised you";;
Lillelaps#8753;14-Mar-18 01:51 PM;"And that you're careful and observant enough, and ready for the possibility that it might be there";;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;14-Mar-18 01:51 PM;"@Malfred#1000 That's a good point, and serves to remind that Death in Dark Souls is just another tool for conveying the games' lessons.";;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;14-Mar-18 01:52 PM;Rather than as a punishment or failure state.;;
StardustHoopa#2085;15-Mar-18 04:17 AM;I haven't played any of the Souls games yet.;;

Pecca#5742;15-Mar-18 07:38 AM;I doubt King's Field has bosses on the levels of DeS;;
Malfred#1000;15-Mar-18 07:38 AM;World Tendency was the only thing that wasn't carried over in some fashion.;;

Pecca#5742;15-Mar-18 07:39 AM;I have 500+ hours in it;;
Pecca#5742;15-Mar-18 07:40 AM;It was my first game in the series;;
Malfred#1000;15-Mar-18 07:41 AM;Fair enough. Maybe my PoV is different since I started out with Demon's Souls.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;15-Mar-18 07:43 AM;Same.;;
Malfred#1000;15-Mar-18 07:43 AM;"While Gwyn's was a memorable fight, it was only because he was the culmination of the journey.";;

Cyran#2122;19-Mar-18 01:57 PM;"So, I never thought about this. But, in the world of ruin your characters are auto leveled down to match Celes (or the current party's average level), , So, say you keep celes at level 20. But you get your stat bonuses on the rest of your party say up to... level 40., , When you get Sabin in the WoR due to Celes only being 20 does his level also go down to 20? and from there do the rest of the characters then become 20 if you don't level celes or Sabin up? And if so, do they lose any bonuses that they gained in WoB to get up to level 40 or is this a way to get extra stats on a lot of characters?";;

Malfred#1000;27-Mar-18 07:43 AM;It is a decent game;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 07:43 AM;No;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 07:44 AM;It's bad;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 07:44 AM;Good story with gameplay that just doesn't work and is flawed as fuck;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:20 AM;The gameplay is fine. They tried doing a weird thing where your attributes raised as you used them rather than having levels.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:20 AM;Which means that you can take advantage of weirdness.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:20 AM;But if you play it straight then it ends up feeling pretty similar to 1 with a better story.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:21 AM;"(The better story in this case is basically just anime Star Wars but w/e, it was 1988)";;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:52 AM;But the dungeons suck and you're either too weak or too overpowered;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:53 AM;There's no balance;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:54 AM;Most of the weapon proficiencies are worthless because playing unarmed is the most powerful weapon;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:58 AM;I've been playing through and it's all fine. Sometimes I have to grind a little.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:58 AM;It's pretty much the same gameplay loop as the first bunch of Final Fantasies.;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:58 AM;Literally the progression is the worst part;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:58 AM;EVERY enemy in the entire game has the same benefits;;

Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:59 AM;So battles become boring;;
Socindwich#0753;27-Mar-18 08:59 AM;With little reward;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;27-Mar-18 08:59 AM;That's not really why battles are interesting.;;

chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 12:12 PM;"on the wiki it says you can swap party members freely in the gba port of 4, does that mean the certain characters that you may not be able to use for *certain* reasons can still be used after things happen to them?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 12:36 PM;Yes;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 12:37 PM;You have to wait til end game though;;

chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 02:56 PM;also how do i use things from equipment? some of my items say casts ___ when used;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 02:56 PM;how do i do that;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;29-Mar-18 02:59 PM;In most RPGs you just use the item from your inventory in battle;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;29-Mar-18 02:59 PM;I don't remember doing that in 4 tho;;
Trickster#9840;29-Mar-18 03:06 PM;"@chwoods#6004 After you beat the final boss and watch the credits, the post-game dungeon opens up and you  got deposited right outside the crystal tower, I think. , To use an item you have equipped, click on items and press up to select it mid battle";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:07 PM;no in ff1;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 03:07 PM;In those games something like the Fire Rod can be used to cast Fire but it breaks when this happen;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:07 PM;but alright;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:07 PM;ah ok;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:07 PM;so i cant be wearing it?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 03:08 PM;If you have another you can use it. You can use a rods power still if its equipped but again it breaks;;
Trickster#9840;29-Mar-18 03:09 PM;Not in ff4 iirc;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:09 PM;ah ok;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:09 PM;thank you;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:10 PM;last thing about ff4;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:10 PM;what version should i get?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:11 PM;"ive played it on pc but i perfer having a real copy, so im thinking between getting a snes or just getting the gba version";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 03:11 PM;No not in FF4 butt its worth mentioning this becomes a mechanic in FFV;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 03:11 PM;GBA or PSP is the best option;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:12 PM;so gba then?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 03:12 PM;Yup;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 03:12 PM;alright cool;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 05:15 PM;I'd go with PSP personally;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 05:15 PM;The remastered music is great and it comes with After years;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 05:16 PM;yeah the PSP version is the way to go;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 05:17 PM;the DS/PC/mobile version is worth a playthrough too since it's all 3D and that makes it feel different and whatnot;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 05:17 PM;no reason to play any other versions;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 05:23 PM;DS is considerably harder though so tread carefully;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 05:33 PM;I'd say do PSP version *then* (some time down the line) DS version;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:19 PM;i really enjoy the music though;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:20 PM;and the psp looks like it was made by fans in unity;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:20 PM;Its the best lookin version imo;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:21 PM;🤔 the PSP version looks fantastic;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:21 PM;best looking version by far imo;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:21 PM;Unlike FFV/6;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:21 PM;the 3d one looks okay but the 2d style just looks like it was made in rpg maker;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:22 PM;the overworld looks nice;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:22 PM;"you are aware the game was a 2D game originally, yeah?";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:22 PM;yes i know;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:22 PM;the PSP version looks like it always did but not pixelated to hell;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:22 PM;ive played a lot of the snes ver;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:22 PM;You cant pull off those visuals in RPG Maker. Watch the Meteor animation and tell me RPM can do that;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:24 PM;"okay okay, im not trying to argue, i personaly dont like the psp version and like the more pixelated version and wanted a ver closest to the snes version";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:24 PM;GBA will work;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:25 PM;"yeah, but then you're missing Interlude and The After Years which is actually quite a bit of content";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:25 PM;TAY is eh imo the tales are the best part imo;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:25 PM;well i can still play after years on pc if i want to but ive heard its just the same game over again;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:26 PM;what is the interlude?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:26 PM;TAY is NOT a repeat this is a lie;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:27 PM;oh?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:27 PM;doesnt it have the same sorta plot points or at least the same final boss?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:28 PM;Find out for yourself its better to go in blind;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:28 PM;i might play it after i finish all the main line games up to 9 or 10;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:30 PM;Just be wary when you reach The Crystals tale you will get your butt kicked hard;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:31 PM;i might have to buy a psp;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:31 PM;the pc versoin looks horrid;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:32 PM;Ff4 pc is DS;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:32 PM;i mean after years;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:33 PM;that ui;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:33 PM;jeez;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:33 PM;thats like ff6 port level of ui;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:34 PM;Its just the DS models instead of sprites its not that bad;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:34 PM;no the characters are fine;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:34 PM;the battle ui is bad;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:35 PM;and lazy;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:36 PM;You do realize the UI is the same as DS right?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:36 PM;yeah;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:36 PM;still;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:36 PM;So whats the issue then;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:36 PM;its not good?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:37 PM;Except it is;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:37 PM;at least thats what i think;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:37 PM;Except its fine;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:37 PM;"its fine, but not good";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:38 PM;they could have at least made it so the action box and the health boxs lined up;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:38 PM;Ff4 PC doesnt do that either;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:38 PM;i know;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:39 PM;im not saying any of them on pc or ds has good ui;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:39 PM;psp is the best looking out of the ports;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:40 PM;its just square and their porting;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:40 PM;You expect a port of a DS's game UI to be different? Especially when nothing was wrong with it in the first place?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:41 PM;`You expect a port of a DS's game UI to be different? Especially when nothing was wrong with it in the first place?` That's this fanbase in a nutshell;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:41 PM;I know;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:41 PM;"uh, the ds version has a way different battle ui?";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:42 PM;No it doesnt DS and PC are identical check your info;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:42 PM;so the ds has 2 screens;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;hp is on one screen and the actions appear on the top when needed;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;Bottom screen is for the map in ff4DS;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;and that;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;does pc have 2 screens?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;no;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;You **can** have two monitors though :P;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:43 PM;Ok but a PC has a significantly larger screen wheres your point;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:44 PM;yeah but the game doesnt support it does it?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:44 PM;ok so the screen is bigger;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:44 PM;why couldnt they have put a better ui then?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:44 PM;Cause there's nothing wrong with the DS UI;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:44 PM;Is there a need to change a perfectly functional UI? No;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:45 PM;the pc ui isnt the same as the pc;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:45 PM;If anything the PC boosted the pixelation of it;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:45 PM;Meaning it made it look cleaner;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:45 PM;DS and them pixels are hard to look at uggh;;

chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:46 PM;how?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:46 PM;didnt you say that the pc and ds have the same ui?;;

Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:46 PM;the DS UI looks slightly better but honestly who cares really?;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:47 PM;it's fine and doesn't detract from the game;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:47 PM;Exactly at least its not distractingly unpolished or somethin;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:47 PM;then why is it being defended?;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:48 PM;what do you mean?;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:48 PM;cause you're complaining about it I guess;;

Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:48 PM;when it doesn't really matter;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:48 PM;Why not just play the game for the game instead;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:48 PM;im sorry;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;im really sorry;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;"the UI on pc is uglier, yes, I agree";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;i lost it a little bit;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;but idk it's just not a big deal imo;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;it doesnt matter;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;You're fine;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:49 PM;i just really dont like squares porting;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:50 PM;Tbf there ports arent always top notch anyway cough FF5/6;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:50 PM;But they're not the worst things ever;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:51 PM;There not M Night Shamalan films;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:51 PM;"they arent, but isnt it an issue that people are puting up with sqaures shit just because?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:52 PM;"No, I think it's an issue that people are complaining about minor changes in the first place";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:52 PM;"but would you rather have a good port that lives up with the original or a port that isnt that great, and is only okay";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:53 PM;I mean if I can play a great game on a platform where it didnt originate from and still enjoy it isnt that what matters?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:53 PM;isnt this where the issue is?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:54 PM;you are just accepting the port because you can play it;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:54 PM;Like lets say my first time playing FF6 was IOS cuzz i didnt grow up in the 90s well i'd like the game still cuzz FF6 is amazing;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:54 PM;what if it had the same graphics?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:54 PM;would you rather have that?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:55 PM;Not everyone had that chance to play FF6 on SNES i know i didnt;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:55 PM;i didnt either;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:55 PM;Ok but would I know what FF6 looked liked before? No cuzz afaik this IOS version is the only one I know in this fake scenario lets say;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:56 PM;so?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:56 PM;if it doesnt matter what it looks like for them why not make it the same for the people who wanted a new way to play the classic?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 06:59 PM;my close friend played ff6 on ps1 when he was a child with his father because his father played the snes ver and wanted to play it again;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 06:59 PM;The best reason I can find that they changed the visuals was to appeal to kids growing up in the smartphone age. Those kids never got to play FF6 before so they have no opinion on what it looks like yet until they decide to research the game after they play it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 06:59 PM;"Cause they're porting something, not remaking it, and most of the time, companies hand the porting to a third party";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:00 PM;Exactly;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:00 PM;so they decided to put more work into remaking all of the graphics?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:00 PM;that doesnt sound like a port;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:01 PM;Well they HAD to rework the graphs for a simple UI interface remember no controllers;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:01 PM;what about ff7 on the phone;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:01 PM;they figured out how to do it there didnt they?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:02 PM;they could have just put a dpad on it;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:02 PM;Ff7 was a 3D game reworking the visuals would take more work;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:03 PM;"Look, the only people who want everything to be exactly the same are the same people who would rather just play the SNES version anyway";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:03 PM;but they reworked the menu ui so it was easy on phone right?;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:03 PM;why didnt they just do that?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:03 PM;Because it looks like ass;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:04 PM;"also yes, but you have to remember how much it costs for someone to buy a snes copy of ff6 and a snes?";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:04 PM;They had the opportunity to update it cuzz its a 2d sprite game so its much easier to rework visuals;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:04 PM;so its more of a remake then;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:04 PM;right?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:04 PM;Emulator still exist;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:05 PM;Rework imo but call it what ya will;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:05 PM;If it was remade much more differences would exist like FF6 being 3D instead of 2D sprites;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:05 PM;"they do, but a lot of people dont know how to use them and they are also not moral for everyone";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:07 PM;Lmao Olay;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:07 PM;yeah but that still doesnt mean it isnt;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:08 PM;Its not a remake just redone visuals everything else is exactly identical. Use FF2 USA vs FF4 DS as an example of a Remake;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:08 PM;"Look dude, I know you're a purist, but that's just not how the world works";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:08 PM;"im not, i just wish the ports were better";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:09 PM;like dawn of souls;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:09 PM;Im not a fan of its design choice either but if it was the only way I could play FF6 in 2018 id be happy;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:10 PM;"It doesn't matter what you think, what matters is what makes SE the most money";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:10 PM;Yeah at the end of the day its all $$$;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:11 PM;Don't fall under the delusion that SE somehow cares about you or the fans;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:11 PM;First off they don't give a rat's ass about *anyone* outside of japan;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:12 PM;"Second off, enfranchised players won't buy new product, especially fans of the NES/SNES titles";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:12 PM;New players on phones aren't used to pixels and don't want to see them. They want high resolution graphics.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:13 PM;Pixels and aliasing are anathema to new players.;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:15 PM;then why does octo have pixels then? do you think new people who arent into rpgs will play a game with a complex system for gameplay and a 20 hour story?;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:15 PM;Unless the game diliberately uses a pixel art style;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:15 PM;well yeah;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:16 PM;Because it's not a final fantasy title;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:16 PM;how does that make a difference;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:16 PM;Octopath is on a console first off so bad example secondly the pixel art is a homage to classic games;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:16 PM;its made by the same people;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:16 PM;Because it's a new title and not a port. They want final fantasy fans to buy it.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:17 PM;They may not like you but they know how to use you. They're not stupid.;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:17 PM;Your giving an example of a mobile port vs a brand new game on a console those are two widely  different subjects;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 07:17 PM;"Ignore Sazh, he likes to talk out of his ass";;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:17 PM;does that make a difference?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:17 PM;He's picking on new players won't buy pixels;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:18 PM;Octopath is a game primarily designed for old school rpg fans to buy;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:18 PM;Im so excited for Octopath on hat note;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:18 PM;same;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:18 PM;I mean it looks cool;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:18 PM;I'm not buying a switch for it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:18 PM;But it's cool;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:19 PM;"With games like the old Final Fantasies, the pixelated look was a result of system limitations. You really couldn't have made it look much better on the systems they originally came out for. With the re-releases and ports, they've wanted to upgrade the visuals a bit now that those limitations are a non-issue, but without too much cost ie simply make them smoother. The results are mixed, sure, but I'd think that's the idea. With Octopath Traveler however, the pixelated look is a deliberate artistic choice, and not because of limitations";;
Nigg#3182;29-Mar-18 07:20 PM;I mean it's a really nice RPG for switch owners but I can't see a release on other platforms for it;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:20 PM;"i know from my experience when i was just starting out with ff, i got one and was put off by it from its large system and difficult story";;
Nigg#3182;29-Mar-18 07:20 PM;maybe steam;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:21 PM;so something looking nice wont make people go towards it unless its really good looking;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:22 PM;also what about mega man and their ports?;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:22 PM;Megaman is a different company entirely;;

Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;Megaman 11 looks fine though;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;his running animation was a bit jank;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;that was about it;;

Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;all Megamans do;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;Legacy Collection is finr;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;the classic series at least;;
Lillelaps#8753;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;X and such is faster;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;Yeah but it's aimed at old players;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;Legacy that is;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 07:24 PM;They were banking on old fans re-buying it;;
chwoods#6004;29-Mar-18 07:25 PM;"but many people bought it even though they didnt like it, i know because most of my friends got it even though they have never played one before";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:02 PM;Lmao;;
Nipsey#3540;29-Mar-18 08:02 PM;i have been using exdeath;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:05 PM;"So what you're asking is, what magic user in the FF franchise would beat everyone else in a fight?";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 08:06 PM;Exdeath;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:06 PM;Probably Exdeath;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:06 PM;Vivi is up there;;
Nipsey#3540;29-Mar-18 08:08 PM;so i made the right choice using exdeath;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:08 PM;Well I mean it depends on the game's stats;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 08:09 PM;Yeah honest i have no clue how Exdeath loses in his own game;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 08:10 PM;Were speaking of power on different terms. You shoulda asked for sheer numbers game cuzz Exdeath does not have the most magic in the FF series;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:11 PM;Record Keeper has its own stats system that's balanced so that nobody is super crazy OP;;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 08:11 PM;Exactly if it were the games most superbosses outclass Exdeath;;
Nipsey#3540;29-Mar-18 08:11 PM;would offensive magic be better than master of magic;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:12 PM;You'd have to ask someone who plays record keeper;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:12 PM;Which is like;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 08:12 PM;Four people;;

pokemongenius#1474;29-Mar-18 08:12 PM;Which is not me :miss:;;
Nipsey#3540;29-Mar-18 08:15 PM;is significantly more higher than much more;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;7;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;Lmao;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;6;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;"If you've played crisis core, might as well play 7";;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;lmao;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;Crisis core is a spin-off of 7;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;6 is the essential game smh;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;"So, play 7";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;so should i just wait for the remake?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;no;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;KEK;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;HA;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:43 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;You'll be dead by the time the remake comes out;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;You mean the vaporware?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;Yeah fuck no;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;Get a ps1 emulator and play 7;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;And there's no guarantee that the remake will offer the same experience;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;Play 7 as it is;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:44 PM;I'd say play 6 tbh;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:45 PM;alright what are your thoughts on final fantasy 15 and type-0?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:46 PM;Do not play type-0;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:46 PM;XV alright;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:46 PM;Don't expect too much;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:46 PM;XV is okay but not gonna blow your mind;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:46 PM;Stay as far away from type-0 as you can;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:46 PM;It's part of the 13 mythos and is somehow even worse;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:47 PM;"Fabula Nova Crystallis is not Final Fantasy's high point, to be sure";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:47 PM;i must ask whats else is wrong with type-0?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:47 PM;You know how 13 plays itself by mashing the A button?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:47 PM;You don't even have to mash in type-0;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:47 PM;Just hold A;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:47 PM;Type 0 is also a stupid name;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:48 PM;smh;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:48 PM;"To be fair, that's how it is in XV";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 09:48 PM;Nothing's really wrong with Type-0;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:48 PM;At least in XV you aren't micromanaging 12 people from the start;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:48 PM;really hold A? not even the telltale games do that;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:49 PM;Nobody really plays Final Fantasy for the engaging gameplay;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:49 PM;but i saw gameplay it looked like crisis core;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:49 PM;Okay it's a little more than just holding A;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 09:49 PM;That's cause it's a PSP title;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:49 PM;wait what serious i thought thats why its so popular!;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:50 PM;You also have to look at people;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:50 PM;"No, final fantasy is all about the lore";;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:50 PM;I mean I like the static command RPG system;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;Nobody would say that turn based RPGs have good gameplay;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;They are carried by their amazing stories and engaging characters;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;🤔;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;Except for 13 whose story is a dumpster fire;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;That's debatable;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;I really enjoyed 6's gameplay;;
Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 09:51 PM;and 5's;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:52 PM;"Yes, everyone likes 6, it is the pinnacle of gaming.";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:52 PM;okay what what persona 5 i'm planning to buy that is it about the gameplay or the  lore as well?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:52 PM;"Both, really";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:52 PM;Well;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:53 PM;"If you're into the whole Japanese life simulator thing, the lore is there";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Mar-18 09:53 PM;It's basically a visual novel;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:53 PM;I wouldn't go that far;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:53 PM;But it's extremely text heavy;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:54 PM;If you liked Catherine you'll probably like P5;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;29-Mar-18 09:55 PM;"i've been really going out of my way to play these JRPG games I'm just baffled to be honest i taught it was all about the strategy, gameplay stuff like that";;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:55 PM;Persona 5 is as much about fusing Personas and dungeon crawling as it is about slice of life simulation;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:55 PM;JRPG games are just fuckin' weird;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:55 PM;^;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 09:55 PM;But that's the whole reason I play them;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:56 PM;Most of them are locked off to you until you become the sort of weeaboo that is to weeaboos what weeaboos are to normal people.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;29-Mar-18 09:56 PM;"And school simulator, don't forget that";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 09:59 PM;Anime is your first step into weeaboo;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Mar-18 10:00 PM;Though one could argue that being a weeaboo is not a positive thing;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Mar-18 10:00 PM;It is a very negative thing;;

chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:39 PM;How do I set up Edgar as a dragoon;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:39 PM;In ff6;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:39 PM;A guide for some fights says to use him;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:40 PM;This game is too much for me;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;09-Apr-18 08:41 PM;you need to get the dragoon boots and equip them to him;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;09-Apr-18 08:41 PM;there he's a dragoon;;
Socindwich#0753;09-Apr-18 08:47 PM;I made Locke a dragoon;;
Socindwich#0753;09-Apr-18 08:47 PM;It's amazing;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:47 PM;I forgot what it's called;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:47 PM;But in the place where you bet items he won't jump;;
Socindwich#0753;09-Apr-18 08:47 PM;Because the moves he uses are random;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:49 PM;Well duh;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:49 PM;But he attacks with his sword;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:51 PM;And he doesn't jump;;
chwoods#6004;09-Apr-18 08:53 PM;I'm just getting tired of ff6 in general;;

Malfred#1000;10-Apr-18 01:42 AM;"It says follow-up, so that's probably true";;
Malfred#1000;10-Apr-18 01:42 AM;I just remember it as being released before Type-0;;
Malfred#1000;10-Apr-18 01:43 AM;Although I think that's because Type-0's project name was Agito XIII;;

La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:06 PM;I've been recently testing out jrpg titles that I've recently bought (Disgaea 4 & Valkyria Chronicles) and i found myself trying to figure out what is exactly a turn base game can you guys help me out with that question;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:07 PM;"Anything that stops you in your tracks to have and fight, and then you get a menu of let's say, attack, magic, summon, item and guard";;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:07 PM;First your group attacks;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:07 PM;Then the enemy group attacks;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:07 PM;Boom;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:08 PM;would Valkyria Chronicles be considered turn base or is it a Tactical JRPG;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:08 PM;No clue what that game is;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:08 PM;Do you;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:08 PM;Attack the enemy and then they attack and you can't do anything about it?;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:09 PM;Valkyria Chronicles is one of those weird hybrid turn based games.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:09 PM;But it's closer to a tactical JRPG.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:10 PM;"What JRPGs have you played, Troy & Abed?";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:13 PM;"I've played (Pokemon Blue & Emerald, FF Crisis Core, Mega Man battle Network,Shaman King, Disgaea 4, Final Fantasy 13) I've Beaten (Tales of Xillia) and out of the ones I played in terms of combat I disliked (Disgaea 4 & FF13)";;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:13 PM;"Cool, the only one I don't know anything about in that list is Shaman King.";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:14 PM;its was basically a Game Boy Advance pokemon x persona rip off;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:15 PM;So in that list the only two that're not some kind of turn-based are Crisis Core and Tales of Xillia.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:15 PM;Pokemon could be considered pure turn-based: you select your action for the turn at the same time as the enemy then the RNG determines whose action goes off first.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:16 PM;FF13 uses a variant of what classic Final Fantasies referred to as the Active Time Battle system. Where you have a speed that determines how frequently you can act and you select your actions from a menu.;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:17 PM;"Oh, i fucking hate that";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;FF13 takes the idea of the ATB system and kinda...mutilated it;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;"Kinda, yeah.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;Kinda?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;Understatement;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;It sucks that you can only control one person at a time.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;It may have committed some light treason;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;That's my only gripe with it.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;"(Mmm, Arrested Development)";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;11-Apr-18 01:18 PM;Yeah 13 sucks and doesn't deserve to be called Final Fantasy;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:19 PM;I disagree.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:19 PM;"Hmm, I played Megaman Battle Network 2 but I've forgotten exactly how it plays.";;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:20 PM;I don't really like MBN;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:20 PM;I know it has like a deckbuilding element where you have to build your suite of actions between battles.;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;11-Apr-18 01:20 PM;Because i never know where to go;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;11-Apr-18 01:20 PM;"Call em: Lightning Begins, Lightning Reloaded, Lightning Returns <a:hahagif:394630721165197322>";;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:20 PM;"But yeah, I don't remember the combat mechanics.";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:21 PM;some point in Mega Man Battle Network i always get stuck you can move your megaman in this 9 square red grid;;

La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:26 PM;how would FF15 Combat compare to Tales of Xillia and FF: Crisis Core would it be considered the same or is it something entirely different.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:45 PM;It's definitely not turn-based.;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;11-Apr-18 01:45 PM;It's closer to Crisis Core than other Final Fantasies.;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 01:52 PM;Oh I forgot to mention I played Ni No Kuni 1 Demo but didn't enjoy the combat but I plan to pick up Persona 5 in the future would Persona 5 be a good choice for me?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Apr-18 01:54 PM;I've seen people who hate turn based combat still love Persona 5;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Apr-18 01:54 PM;Its worth giving a chance if you're even remotely into JRPGs;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;11-Apr-18 02:05 PM;"hopefully I plan to explore JRPG's a bit more I have Persona 5, FF Type-0, FF15, FF7R, DQ8, Star Ocean left to pick up";;

Ringabel#3038;14-Apr-18 02:34 PM;Hey guys I am so lost in FFVI;;
Ringabel#3038;14-Apr-18 02:35 PM;I've gotten to the WoR and I've gotten a few characters but I have no idea what to do.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Apr-18 02:35 PM;"@SanDimas1988#9581 Yo okay so, just so you know, you don't have to start from 1. All the numbered games are, y'know...their own game.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Apr-18 02:36 PM;FF2 is not a sequel to FF1;;
SanDimas1988#9581;14-Apr-18 02:36 PM;Oh I know. But these games are classics for a reason. May as well check them out;;

DepWek#5890;14-Apr-18 02:37 PM;O like ffce;;
Silverx1987#9781;14-Apr-18 02:37 PM;The only downside I see not starting from the first one is that you may never ever play them once you start with one of the higher numbered entries.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Apr-18 02:37 PM;I might get around to FF1 one of these days;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Apr-18 02:37 PM;But I gotta finish 12 first;;
Silverx1987#9781;14-Apr-18 02:37 PM;Because they're pretty bland compared to the rest of the series.;;

DepWek#5890;14-Apr-18 02:39 PM;VI and VII seem most popular;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Apr-18 02:39 PM;VII is the most popular with the general public. Ask any given gamer what their favorite FF game is and probably 9 times out of 10 it'll be FF7;;
DepWek#5890;14-Apr-18 02:40 PM;Fair enough;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Apr-18 02:40 PM;With FF fans specifically? Probably 6.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 12:58 PM;I'm playing on Vita;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 12:58 PM;the PSOne emulation;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 12:58 PM;"PS1? Yeah, it doesn't";;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 12:59 PM;Oh ew;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 12:59 PM;I went to that little house outside Narshe that teaches you the basics... it told me about the little sparkly save points but I dont thinik it mentioned anything about saving on the game map.;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 12:59 PM;The PS1 version isn't the greatest;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 12:59 PM;Its playable;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 12:59 PM;I mean;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 12:59 PM;Seems completely fine to me;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;but I've never played an FF game before... so...;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;The loading times are...... Yeah;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;I can't stand load times in encounters where they were never there before;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;Hmm... mine doens't seem that bad... the only bad load time is when I first boot up the game.;;
CupcakeGamer#1065;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;i've played so many;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;If you play the other versions you'll see what I mean;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:00 PM;Maybe PS1 emulation on Vita supports 2x disk speed;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:01 PM;Or perhaps it's just that you don't have a benchmark to compare it to;;
CupcakeGamer#1065;19-Apr-18 01:01 PM;FF8 is my fave;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:01 PM;You can change disk speed to fast versus normal;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:02 PM;It didn't make much difference to me for my IX playthrough but YMMV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:02 PM;"Also, why have I see some websites where the sprites are all different than what I have on my version?";;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:02 PM;Because they updated the sprites for the mobile and PC versions;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:03 PM;"Mine look like the old SNES ones, which is great... whereas the others are this weird updated kinda style";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:03 PM;ah... ok... I certainly prefer the ones on the Vita;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:03 PM;That's a very common sentiment;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:03 PM;:kefka:;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;Yeah... there's that little bastard... haha;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;I also completely suck at turn-based combat;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;this is my first foray into it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;Apparently I'm still very early in the game so maybe I'll get the hang of it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;"Oh, make sure you hop into config and change the battle type to wait if it isn't already";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;"Yeah, did that.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:04 PM;You can also change the speed of combat;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;did that too... haha;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;Wait is default;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;I thought;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;Is it? I thought Active was default;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;Maybe I'm confuzzled;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;Wait was always default when I played;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;It is defaulted to wait. I happened to go through config early on and had to look up what that menat;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:05 PM;* meant;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:06 PM;"6 isn't overly difficult, no FF really is";;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:06 PM;You should be fine;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:06 PM;"I don't have much in terms of attacks right now. HOpefully once my options increase, it'll make more sense";;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:06 PM;Oh by the way;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:06 PM;Wait for Shadow;;
Thelitedragon#4507;19-Apr-18 01:07 PM;You'll know what I mean when you get to it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:07 PM;"Yeah.. yeah... I got that too ;_0";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:07 PM;😉;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:07 PM;And something about Suplexing the train. I think that comes up when I do Sabin's scenario;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:07 PM;I don't really use Shadow anyway;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:08 PM;"Out of curiosity, once I finish up those three scenarios, how far through the game am I?";;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:09 PM;Not even halfway id say;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:10 PM;That's what I figured. Wasn't sure if it was 10% or 40% or somewhere in between.;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:11 PM;The halfway point isn't until much later;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:11 PM;I still can't believe the depth of this game given it's age. The whole mechanic with changing outfits in South Figaro during Locke's scenario... I was blown away that a game from 20 years ago had that depth.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:12 PM;Today it is considered primitive obviously... I was just really surprised.;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:12 PM;"Terra, Locke, Celes, Realm, only characters you'll ever need";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:12 PM;"Ha, everyone seems to have a different answer for that.";;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:13 PM;Don't get attached to Cyan;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:13 PM;Once you finish Sabins story you'll never want to use him again;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:14 PM;Haha.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:16 PM;I travel a bunch for work. Was on a cross-country (USA) flight the other day. Decided to download FFVI on my Vita on a whim for the flight. I started playing when we took off and literally didn't put it down until we were coming in to land. Have no idea where all those hours went... ha;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:16 PM;The sad truth is although FF6 has the largest cast not many get significant development cuzz Square didnt know who to focus on. Although Terra is widely considered the protagonist its often debated her status gets overshadowed by Locke and Celes;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:17 PM;"I've heard that. At first, Terra seemed to be the protagonist. The more I play, she seems to have dropped in that category. Since I just finished Locke's scenario, he seems like the new protagonist. But I'm sure as I complete the other two scenarios, my perception will change again.";;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:17 PM;Terra is the main character and nothing will change that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:18 PM;Haha.;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:19 PM;I can make the arguement that Terra has alot more significance than most ppl credit her for but i can see where the arguement comes from;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:20 PM;I also haven't micromanaged stats or equipment for the characters yet... it just hasn't seemed necessary this early in the game. I don't think I have any amazing equipment to mess around with yet. I apparently missed the Genji Gloves from that dude who asks me to join the resistance;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:21 PM;What I've heard is that I don't really start learning new magic/attacks/etc. until second half of the game. Same with better equipment. Is that the general consensus?;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:21 PM;Micro management gets too deep too fast dont worry about it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:22 PM;Ha. Cool. I'm kinda looking forward to that.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:22 PM;Right now I just equip whatever I have in terms of weapons/clothing/relics;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:22 PM;Its impossible to get max stats anyways;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:26 PM;I still can't believe I didn't know about being able to save in the world map... ugh... I've only died a couple times but once was to the boss at the end of Locke's scenario (thing that comes out of the wall). I hadn't saved in quite a while and ended up having to go back quite a ways... knowing that would have saved me a good 30 mins. Not the end of the world but definitely annoying.;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:29 PM;You must be new to JRPGS cuzz thats a common feature being able to save on the map. Granted if you had played Dragon Quest all the time then i wouldnt blame ya for not knowing;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:31 PM;"Regarding combat, what is the deal with changing orders... or levels? I don't get that. Order is the order they attack in... but then one of the messages I got from the Narshe school mentioned something about attack and defense being halved if you're in the back row/level...";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:31 PM;and yes... never played a JRPG or even a turn-based combat game before this one.;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:33 PM;That explains everything. Yes changing rows affects damage taken from enemies and damage dealt to enemies;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:35 PM;How do you change rows?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:36 PM;"Assuming high-damage, low HP go to the back row and the tanks go front row, generally speaking?";;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:37 PM;Late game everyone should be in the back;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:37 PM;Thanks for the help by the way. I'm five hours in and really enjoying it. But I still feel like I barely have a clue what I'm doing.;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:37 PM;In battle or in menu. In battle hit left or right after ATB charges. In menu go toward the character portaits and double click them if that doesnt work try Order in the menu (i dont recall whats in the menu atm);;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 01:38 PM;Late game everyone should be using magic or double jumping;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:38 PM;I can change the order during battle by going left and re-ordering them that way. Does that change their row as well?;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:39 PM;You cant re order in battle only change rows;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:40 PM;"OK, so when I go left... that is for rows and not order. I thought it said Order when I did that... I'm sure I'm just mixed up. Lot of stuff to digest as a novice.";;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:41 PM;Theres no need to change Order anyways you can hit cancel to cycle through each character who has a charged ATB;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:42 PM;"Right, that's what I thought.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:54 PM;So should everyone pretty much be in the back row?;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:55 PM;Late game your team should be good enough to ignore the damage reduction in back row;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:55 PM;Locke up front maybe because of his physical attack?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:56 PM;"So late game, row shouldn't really matter?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:56 PM;Or do I just throw everyone in the back regardless and roll through this Kefka schmuck with authority?;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:56 PM;Dual Wield Master Scroll Dualcast is so broken;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 01:57 PM;Trust me you hardly need to care late game strategy doesnt really exist xD;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:57 PM;"Being over-powered is OK with me. I'll worry about increasing difficulty when I play future FF games (or Chrono Trigger, or Planescape)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 01:58 PM;Right now I'm just trying to learn and get my feet wet.;;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 02:00 PM;"To increase difficulty would need restrictions or mods cuzz base game is pretty easy imo. If you compare the 2D games 3 and 4 (japanese), and 5 are the hardest";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 02:01 PM;"Ha, considering I don't really know what I'm doing, it's not that easy yet.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 02:01 PM;"Granted, I've only died 3 times in 5 hours... so, I guess that's not terrible.";;
pokemongenius#1474;19-Apr-18 02:01 PM;Mid game you'll know all the tools to plow through the rest;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Apr-18 02:03 PM;That's what I'm hoping.;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 02:56 PM;The only attack that's affected by the back row is the regular Fight command;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 02:57 PM;EVERY thing else does the same damage;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 02:57 PM;And even early game I barely ever use physicals;;
Socindwich#0753;19-Apr-18 02:58 PM;"Edger the archer, Sabin the blitzkerig, Locke the thief and Terra/Celes the magicians";;

Silverx1987#9781;20-Apr-18 02:49 PM;It should be soon after you pick your faction.;;

Silverx1987#9781;20-Apr-18 02:52 PM;But you get it through your faction though.;;
Silverx1987#9781;20-Apr-18 02:52 PM;Or Grand Company rather.;;
Silverx1987#9781;20-Apr-18 02:53 PM;I do remember you need to get a certain type of currency for you Grand Company though.;;
chwoods#6004;20-Apr-18 02:53 PM;ah ok;;
Silverx1987#9781;20-Apr-18 02:54 PM;So I guess just do a couple FATEs and Daily Roulettes while you're getting there so you don't have to grind when you do get the quest.;;
chwoods#6004;20-Apr-18 02:55 PM;daily roulettes?;;

Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:14 PM;yea;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:14 PM;the point of no return is pretty obvious;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:14 PM;just have to backtrack a lot;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:14 PM;but going through the final area is fun;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:14 PM;well;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:14 PM;except for the tonberries;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:14 PM;nah;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:14 PM;free ribbons;;
Silver Haku#5279;05-May-18 06:14 PM;I still need ribbons;;
Silver Haku#5279;05-May-18 06:14 PM;But can't find any;;
Silver Haku#5279;05-May-18 06:14 PM;I have exactly one on tifa;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:15 PM;only game I have ribbons in is IX;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:15 PM;and you get one in the storyline;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:17 PM;I don't think ribbons in IX even block status effects;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:17 PM;grand cross still raped me;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:17 PM;ribbons aren't even that good in IX lol;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:17 PM;yea;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:17 PM;if you need ribbons;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;get the Conformer;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;morph master tonberries in the final dungeon;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;with Yuffies ultimate weapon;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;if you have the sub you can get the Conformer from the crashed/sunken Gelnika;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:18 PM;Never used any character except cid/barret/tifa much;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;also you can morph stat sources from the monster there to beef your party up;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;Yuffie da bes tho;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:18 PM;Doom of the Living is a great limit break;;

Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:24 PM;that's enough of a reason to use him;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:24 PM;I just like dragoons a lot except for Kimahri;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:24 PM;Used freya in IX a lot as well if not the most;;
Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:31 PM;Kimahri was a blue mage though;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:34 PM;...i'm tired;;

Carmine#9363;05-May-18 06:38 PM;Sweden is awesome;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:41 PM;Well I guess it's kinda nice;;
Sclipzer#0168;05-May-18 06:42 PM;We make great metal at least and our nature is good;;

Carmine#9363;06-May-18 02:20 PM;I'm not sure if you have to beat the game...just try playing them I guess;;

Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:52 PM;I'm not gonna;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:52 PM;Get a golden chocobo;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:53 PM;Just so I can get the stuff to beat those;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:53 PM;wat;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:53 PM;you GET a golden chocobo for beating Ruby;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:53 PM;I already beat ultima weapon;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:53 PM;you don't NEED a golden chocobo to get to them;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:53 PM;and you don't need KotR to beat either of them;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:53 PM;"and Ultima Weapon isn't even hard, that's why you have to fight it 4 times";;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:54 PM;"I would need 4x, final attack, quad magic and a w-summon kotr to even consider beating it";;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:54 PM;And I don't have any of those;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:55 PM;wat;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:55 PM;just mime omnislash;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:55 PM;I don't have that either;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:55 PM;all you need is final attack - phoenix;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:55 PM;Because I'm not like you;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:55 PM;To 100% every game;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:55 PM;you're unlike most people;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:55 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:55 PM;because Omnislash is easy as shit to get;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:55 PM;which is why you can get it on disc 1;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:56 PM;actually it's easier to get on disc 1;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:56 PM;I did 3/4 of the side quests;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:56 PM;you got the key to midgar from bone village and went back to midgar and got Tifa's (shitty) ultimate weapon;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:56 PM;Why farm for the things I need for another 6 hours just to beat one or two over powered enemy(s);;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:56 PM;I beat;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:57 PM;Yea I did;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;Ruby Weapon with just w-item materia;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;a ribbon;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;and uhh;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;Organyx;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;or was it a nail bat;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;no Yoshiyuki;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:57 PM;you don't need to farm to beat the weapons;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:58 PM;"if you missed w-item materia, delete your save file";;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:58 PM;lmao;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:58 PM;Well I don't have final attack and that's mandatory;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 04:58 PM;I got the w-item;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:58 PM;"it's only useful for Emerald, not mandatory";;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:59 PM;just don't equip a ton of materia on anyone and Aire Tam Steam won't wipe you;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:59 PM;Materia Steam;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:59 PM;it does damage based on how much materia you have equipped;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:59 PM;that's the only attack that has a chance of wiping you;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 04:59 PM;all you need is mime;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:00 PM;and Omnislash or USE YUFFIE and get Doom of the Living which is a poor version of Omnislash;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:00 PM;Or just play the game how I want;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:00 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:00 PM;it's also faster than Omnislash so you will have more oxygen timer left;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:00 PM;it's possible to beat Emerald without the Underwater Materia;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:01 PM;by that you mean;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:01 PM;not even attempting the challenging content;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:01 PM;and just whizzing through the game;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:01 PM;😦;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:01 PM;Why should I have to?;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:01 PM;you don't;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:01 PM;but you're missing out on fun content by not doing so;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:02 PM;I guess challenges just aren't fun to you;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:02 PM;"if that's the case don't play IX, play VI";;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:02 PM;Sure sure sure;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:02 PM;and say no to joining the Returners 3 times at the beginning;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:02 PM;since you hate challenges;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:02 PM;that will give you the Genji Gloves and make the rest of the game a joke;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:02 PM;Mmhmmmmm;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;"If you played IX you'd probably skip 70% of the side quests, because they're harder than anything in VII";;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;I mean you can just breeze through the main game;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;but you'll be missing the awesome Chocobo Paradise;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;and the fat chocobo;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;and the marble of death;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;and Zidane's ultimate weapon;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;but beating the final boss with The Tower isn't so bad;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:04 PM;I mean I did when I was like 13;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:05 PM;but then I left and got all the chocographs and it was actually fun;;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:05 PM;"Oh no I *hate* challenge apparently, no no no why would I ever do that";;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:05 PM;and then I fought Ozma and died 9 times and figured out what to do and beat it and it was /fun/;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:05 PM;"there's a sidequest that makes Ozma easier, but I didn't do that, because it was annoying";;
Silver Haku#5279;06-May-18 05:06 PM;You must hate annoyances then;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:08 PM;"it involved running around until you meet rare friendly monsters, then giving them a specific gem";;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:08 PM;if I was emulating and had speed up I would've done it;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:08 PM;but I was on original psx hardware and a kid;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:09 PM;also source farming in FF7 is an annoyance;;
Carmine#9363;06-May-18 05:09 PM;and I did that for long enough to make Barret unstoppable;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;06-May-18 11:44 PM;but mostly the same;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;06-May-18 11:46 PM;then again this is comparing to X-2 International and XIII-2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;06-May-18 11:46 PM;so not like that's a major achievement;;

Moiisty#0601;09-May-18 06:50 AM;"Final Fantasy II: 20th Anniversary , This version was released on the PSP. Marking the 20th anniversary of the original Japanese Final Fantasy, Square Enix released the 20th Anniversary collection for Sony's emerging PlayStation Portable handheld. The PSP's optical Universal Media Disc (UMD) allowed greater liberty on the part of game developers. Games could now be cast in higher definition and had greater capacity for content. Square Enix took full advantage of the format, restoring the original PlayStation release's FMV sequences, upscaling and further refining the Dawn of Souls release for the PSP's wider screen, and adding an entirely new set of bonus dungeons known as the Arcane Labyrinths for players seeking a greater challenge., , Later in the handheld's lifecycle, Sony dropped UMD from its portable roadmap altogether, necessitating yet another digital conversion for the PSPgo and the then-forthcoming Vita. Gameplay mechanics for both versions remain identical to those in Dawn of Souls.";;

Bruce#0080;12-May-18 03:20 PM;2nd half or so.....;;
Bruce#0080;12-May-18 03:21 PM;"Basically, you're currently in World of Balance & at a certain point it turns into World of Ruin";;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 03:21 PM;oh ok;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 03:21 PM;like a 2nd story arc;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 03:22 PM;i'm liking ff6 but honestly its so clunky and dated i feel like 6 needs a remake way more than 7.;;
Bruce#0080;12-May-18 03:46 PM;Probably;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 04:36 PM;6 is perfect imo but whatever;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 04:38 PM;If they make a remake I want it in the bravely default graphics on the 3DS;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 04:57 PM;"i mean, no game is perfect";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 05:01 PM;"Yeah, 6 I think has held up far better than just about every FF";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 05:02 PM;"Random encounters and SNES limitations are probably the only thing that would seem dated about it, but it still feels more refined than any of the PSX FFs, I think";;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 05:22 PM;I think what makes me say it is the menus in this game. I'm a stickler with UI and they way menus are designed and I don't think I like these as much;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 05:24 PM;You're not playing the android version are you?;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 05:24 PM;That ones bad;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 05:27 PM;Nah Snes Classic;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 05:27 PM;the ui for all of the games looks bad on the mobile versions lol;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 05:30 PM;The SNES UI doesn't look any differenr from other ff games;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 05:33 PM;the way it looks is the same but the layout/functionality is very different;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 05:47 PM;No?;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 05:47 PM;Still pressing buttons to do things;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 05:52 PM;that is not what i mean lol;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 09:40 PM;ok im on that floating island in ff6 and im not getting good enough rng to get off;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 09:41 PM;...?;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 09:41 PM;Why do you need RNG to get off?;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 09:41 PM;lol what;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 09:42 PM;i keep getting encounters;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 09:42 PM;too many;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 09:44 PM;it just runs the timer out;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 10:02 PM;so run from them?;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:02 PM;you can't run from any of them;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 10:02 PM;then you must be really underleveled if you can't kill them fast enough I guess;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:02 PM;you can't run from any of the encounters there;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 10:03 PM;doing a challenge run?;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 10:03 PM;LLG?;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:03 PM;im 25 lol;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 10:03 PM;as soon as I get the first espers I gain like 10 levels;;
Carmine#9363;12-May-18 10:03 PM;and I do a LLG until then;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:04 PM;if i could have a 4th party member this might be doable lol;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:04 PM;but i cant;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:04 PM;so its not;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:04 PM;idk what to do;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:27 PM;You don't bring Celes if you want a 4th party member;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:28 PM;She joins automatically if shes not in the party;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:28 PM;I never even used Celes that much until the end of the game when you overpower everyone;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:29 PM;Up till then shes just a weaker Terra;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:30 PM;I was like level 30 during the magtek factory lol;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:39 PM;see thats the clunkiness im talking about;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:39 PM;why doesnt the game tell you in that scenario not to bring celes;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:39 PM;just make it so she goes ahead;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:39 PM;or you just can't pick her;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:47 PM;You just have to know some things;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:47 PM;Doesn't bother me much;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:52 PM;i'm sure it doesn't but that's still poor design;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:53 PM;It's still just that one part though;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:54 PM;that's not the only part of the game that is weirdly done;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:55 PM;A lot of games were weirdly done back then;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:57 PM;"No, I can say with pretty good certainty that even back then, games had a consistent set of logic followed throughout the duration of the game. Square clearly did not have the fact that there's like 16 characters important to the story in their heads when coding the game.";;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:57 PM;I'd argue there to be less weird stuff in 6 than 7;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:58 PM;I think the only thing wrong with 7 in terms of logic and coding is the translation is so bad I barely even understood the plot;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:58 PM;The translation is done rather well actually;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:59 PM;What;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:59 PM;Not at all;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 10:59 PM;It's just not the same story at all;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 10:59 PM;I understood it;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 11:00 PM;You just gotta read carefully;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:00 PM;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3vv41c/ff7s_english_translation_was_not_complete_and/;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:00 PM;It's a very different story;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 11:01 PM;I don't get how you can't understand the plot;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 11:01 PM;It's fine what I got;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:02 PM;The way they explained Cloud and Sephiroth's origins was not translated well;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:02 PM;The experimentation and things of that nature;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:02 PM;The translation is just wrong when it comes to that;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 11:03 PM;oh well;;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 11:03 PM;still a fun gam;;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:04 PM;"There's some vagueness and whatnot, but it's pretty damn coherent";;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:04 PM;"Well, yeah it is. It's one of my favorites. As someone in college for game design and someone who looks at content critically I can't be like ok that's how it is";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:05 PM;"It was hugely experimental for the series until then, too. I think some parts could have been more clear, but the vagueness (however intentonal) lended itself to the mystery and ambiguity of some of the plot points";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:06 PM;Having a crappy translation was a common issue for not only FF games from that point in time but a lot of jrpgs from that era;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:06 PM;I'm sure we all remember how disgusting the Ted Woolsey days were;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:08 PM;You can look at games critically sure but that is how it was for games back then(coming from someone who's also studying in the same field but more on the technical side of things);;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:10 PM;"That may have been a sort of standard back then, but that doesn't mean that we can just excuse the fact that it happens. Like with 2-bit graphics. They were standard at the time and thy were good at the time, but they don't look good now.";;
Socindwich#0753;12-May-18 11:10 PM;Sometimes it's funny like Final fantasy 4s translation;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:11 PM;and why do we care whether or not they look good now?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:11 PM;first problem is comparing standards from another era to now;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:12 PM;I can respect how the game was when it came out as well as look at it compared to today;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:12 PM;This reminds me of the conversation brought up in the past about games aging poorly (in the sense that they are no longer good) vs standards changing for gamers;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:12 PM;There's multiple ways to look at it;;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:15 PM;A lot of that is the lack of efficient  technology and text-heavy video games still being a pretty niche market in NA;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:18 PM;"There's nothing that was lacking in technology, it was just translating games with complex stories was not common then";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:19 PM;"hell, just getting them translated alone was expensive";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:19 PM;added on to the other expenses of releasing a game overseas;;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:22 PM;"I said efficient technology. It's so much easier to work a translation when you don't have to worry about things like text limitations (actual screen real estate in low resolution, RAM issues, etc.) the way you did back then";;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:22 PM;Not to mention limitations like cartridge space;;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:23 PM;"And totally. Like you said, much of that is also lack of experience, resources, and so on";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:23 PM;"Yeah, that's part of what I was getting at";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 11:25 PM;"It's weird how, because of the density of the Japanese language and said technical limitations, some older translations (FFVI especially) had so much character";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:26 PM;I'm sure they were always aware of how much space needed to be partitioned for every aspect of their game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:27 PM;"could it have an effect on translation, in some areas where you need to simplify things sure";;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:27 PM;That is not true at all. Content was cut all the time because of cart space.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:28 PM;Just because it was doesn't mean they didn't know;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:29 PM;"as a matter of fact that had to know, or else they'd hit a brick wall while not looking";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:29 PM;often times the stuff that was cut from lack of space were ideas that they knew they couldn't fit in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:30 PM;"it's similar to how things are cut for lack of time, they don't do these things last minute (maybe now they do so that it can be sold back later)";;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:35 PM;You said that they were always aware of the space. That cannot be the case if there's any cut content to begin with.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:38 PM;It can because ideas are never finalized on the first rodeo;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:38 PM;maybe at some point they thought they could do it and then figured it wouldn't work because things changed;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:40 PM;I know 100% for a fact that there are tons of games that had stuff started being coded in and then they stopped because of space;;
SDG#7325;12-May-18 11:40 PM;Nintendo has said in interviews about old game that stuff like that happened frequently;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:40 PM;I'm not arguging that lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-May-18 11:41 PM;I'm saying that they likely knew and if they did have to back pedal it was usually because something else started taking up those resources;;
pokemongenius#1474;13-May-18 08:29 AM;Developers are told the storage limits ahead of time it'd be awkward to say develop Skyrim for the 3DS when its cart space is not nearly enough to contain a game with that magnitude.;;

Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 05:16 AM;"It was like you chose what ending you wanted, and that's what it was in your head. You were like the director of the game for that brief moment. (Not gonna spoil)";;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-May-18 09:51 AM;It's not really a good time for one imo;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-May-18 09:53 AM;"In my opinion, X-2 didn't go in the right direction with the story and writing";;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-May-18 09:53 AM;Maybe it just doesn't appeal to me;;
Leon#9542;24-May-18 10:43 AM;"I liked a lot of what X-2 did. Main issue with it was the inconsistent tone. Things kept jumping between serious and silly, which was very jarring and would sometimes make it difficult to actually take the serious scenes seriously. But I enjoyed it overall, I thought it was neat to see the effects that X's ending had on the world and I liked how Yuna developed.";;
Leon#9542;24-May-18 10:44 AM;"That being said, I'm not really into the idea of a potential X-3, largely because X-2.5/-Will- exist and are very bad. Not interested in seeing any continuation to that mess.";;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:44 AM;Fair points! Thanks for sharing;;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:44 AM;The novel wasn't that bad in my opinion. Did you happen to read the false reports of it online?;;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:45 AM;"There seems to be a lot of misinformation about it, mainly because it's in Japanese and to check it out you have to do it yourself.";;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:45 AM;I saw the fan translation project of it and the very first two sentences I read had a translation error;;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:45 AM;XD;;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:46 AM;"Not saying I read it myself, I don't have the patience to translate it";;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:46 AM;I did read the reports that aren't partial and it seemed to be in the same vein as the games;;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:47 AM;"I understand why you don't like it though, some people can't see Yuna as a singer";;
Dusk Fall#3670;24-May-18 11:47 AM;and take it seriously I mean;;
Leon#9542;24-May-18 01:21 PM;"Yeah, I didn't actually read all of 2.5, my negative views on it are based on summaries from friends who have gone through it. I suppose it's kind of unfair of me to be so dismissive of it when I only have second-hand exposure to it. Ideally I'd read it myself and form my opinion on it that way, but that's not very easy to do, as you said.";;
Leon#9542;24-May-18 01:22 PM;"I actually enjoyed Yuna as a singer though! She already danced as part of sending rituals in X, so I didn't find it too farfetched for her to sing in X-2. I also really love 1000 Words and the scene it's used in.";;
Dusk Fall#3670;25-May-18 03:18 AM;Oh yeah I LOVE that song too;;
Dusk Fall#3670;25-May-18 03:19 AM;♪ They'll hold you forever ♫;;
Dusk Fall#3670;25-May-18 03:20 AM;It's my favorite ballad;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-May-18 06:15 AM;Yeah that fight can just end your game and there's nothing you can do about it;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-May-18 07:38 AM;Use Tranquilizers if all else fails. Barrier helps the most in that fight;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:51 AM;TRICK TO KILLING YAN;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:52 AM;Also you'll want Masamune equipped for Zidane anyways because it gives a bonus to stats on level up (I think it's like the only weapon that does that's usable for Yan fights);;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:52 AM;"Use Soul Blade, which will 100% inflict the Yan with Doom";;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:52 AM;"To make this easier, have Quina along and use Night, then cast auto life on everyone";;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:53 AM;"sometimes a Yan will Snort one of your doods away, or infect them with virus, obviously the latter is curable and should be fixed before the battle ends or they won't get any of that hard earned exp :/";;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:54 AM;just keep the Yans asleep with Night and use Soul Blade with the Masamune equipped and the Yans are pushovers even at low levels;;
Sclipzer#0168;28-May-18 02:50 PM;Can't get masamune on Disc 4 though;;
Sclipzer#0168;28-May-18 02:51 PM;Need the Masamune to inflict Doom with soul blade as well;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 01:31 AM;And GBA has 4 bonus dungeons;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:31 AM;oh ok. so it's just the superior version;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 01:31 AM;"I'd say so, yeah";;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:32 AM;"well good, cuz i just bought the gba cart today lol";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 01:32 AM;"With the PSP version being slightly ahead, but apart from high-res sprites and one additional dungeon, it's not a huge difference";;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:34 AM;"so question, is the princess in the first dungeon somewhere? the one with skeletons and stuff. going back and forth takes awhile LOL";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 01:34 AM;The central room;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 01:35 AM;"IIRC you can literally waltz in, run straight up and get to the boss";;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:36 AM;oh ok nice. black mage keeps dying 😆;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:36 AM;but his magic power is very apparent;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 01:37 AM;Black Mages are meh;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:38 AM;He looks so iconic i had to pick him lol;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:40 AM;this is sort of my start to completing the whole series. I like it so far;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:40 AM;Doesn't seem like ff1 would throw you too many curve balls on where to go exactly?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:45 AM;"As weird as it is, Black mage isn't really op in the original FF";;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:46 AM;"Well, a lot more in the GBA and PSP remakes but still";;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:47 AM;"As Niji pointed out, a lot of things were poorly programmed in the NES and worse, they inflated the difficulty by advantaging the opponents with everything RNG related";;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:48 AM;"Even with my team at level 40, the first goblins could still act before my characters....";;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:49 AM;and thats all fixed on gba?;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:50 AM;feels good so far;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:52 AM;"Yes, it feels so good playing the GBA and PSP versions compared to the NES";;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:53 AM;"You can do most of the game easily if you grind a bit, but as you said, the game doesn't really hold your hand for... half of the game";;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:55 AM;MP and more items diversity too;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:56 AM;"The magic charges with only sleep at the inn or in a Cabin to regenerate them were bullshit, in my opinion";;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:56 AM;I got that feeling right off the bat.;;
Docky#5116;07-Jun-18 01:56 AM;Like no ethers?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:56 AM;Nope;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 01:57 AM;"No Phoenix downs too, and the Raise spell only worked IN FIGHT";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 10:49 AM;"Yeah, I'd even say Black Mages are the worst class of FF1";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 10:50 AM;"I think that of the possible Quadruple same class challenge runs, 4 Black Mages is probably the hardest because of that";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 10:50 AM;"Now imagine having even less leeway in spell usage, in the older version";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 10:53 AM;"About the RNG, NES FF1 had a cyclical Pseudo RNG but with a short cycle (I believe 255 advancements of the seed would loop around). There's a particular group of enemies (A certain number of Ice Dragons in the Ice Cave, IIRC) that, if on the right seed on their first action, will stunlock you to death because they will always prevent your actions (I can't remember the status effect) and by the time they act again, the RNG has looped to the same value";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Jun-18 10:53 AM;So it all happens again;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:16 PM;I’m all trained up. Got all my gear. I’m ready for Kefka. Finally...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:17 PM;"Tonight, I’m taking that asshole down with a metric fuck ton of level 50 characters and lots of Ultima.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:20 PM;Can you cast life 3 on the entire party at once?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:20 PM;Or is it single target?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 03:20 PM;Single 😦;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:20 PM;I should be able to poop on pretty much everyone before they touch me;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:21 PM;Is the dungeon that long?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 03:21 PM;"I meant for the Kefka fight, Life3 will save your ass on the 3rd to last phase";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:22 PM;Oh ha. Yeah. I have all of that. AND a gem box Ultima for his ass.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:22 PM;With a Relm that has 74 magic power.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:25 PM;Celes Relm Strago and terra will have fun with Kefka;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:26 PM;Ultima and grand train.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:26 PM;And life 3 too I guess;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:28 PM;Anyone? Long dungeon or similar to some others?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 03:28 PM;"Oh, sorry, yeah, it's a long dungeon with a bunch of bosses";;
Baguette Cat#6233;07-Jun-18 03:29 PM;"5 mandatory, 2 optionnal, not counting Kefka";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 03:36 PM;Bosses worry me less than the random encounters;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 07:11 PM;I’m actually kinda bummed to complete the game later tonight.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 07:12 PM;I didn’t do absolutely everything and am having some minor FOMO;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Jun-18 07:23 PM;"Missed some dragons (2) and didnt find doom gaze. Oh, and Doma Castle";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jun-18 12:48 PM;"Ok, so having only played VI, what should I know or be aware of for VII? I hear it’s a more linear game. Is that the consensus?";;
Aruu#2066;08-Jun-18 12:49 PM;"It is in a way, in the sense that you won't really ever get lost or not know what to do next.";;
Sclipzer#0168;08-Jun-18 12:50 PM;"It's kinda easy to get lost a bit after rocket town but it's not hard to find where to go next, the map just is very open at that point with no clear pointer where the next location is";;
Aruu#2066;08-Jun-18 12:54 PM;"True, that part is a little tougher, but no-where near as bad as the early games";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jun-18 01:01 PM;VI definitely made me look at a guide quite often.;;
Carmine#9363;09-Jun-18 01:19 PM;That's why I liked X;;
Carmine#9363;09-Jun-18 01:19 PM;if you stop playing for a year for whatever reason all you have to do is open the map and it tells you where you need to go;;
Carmine#9363;09-Jun-18 01:19 PM;same with XII;;
Carmine#9363;09-Jun-18 01:19 PM;probably XIII too;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:20 PM;Hahaha. I got that one.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:21 PM;Feel like I would have put that together somewhat quickly.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:21 PM;The first boss in VI is similar in terms of timed attacking.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:21 PM;Whelk or whatever it was.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:22 PM;The translation is quite goofy in some parts;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:22 PM;"Oh, by the way, I remembered that I beat Kefka without using a single runic from Celes.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:22 PM;She was completely unequipped and died very quickly.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:22 PM;I didn't use Runic at all after the fight when she asked you to near the beginning....;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:22 PM;So did level 74 Relm because she was similarly unewuiped.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:23 PM;Unequipped;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:23 PM;"As I said, the game usually tells you where to go next, even if there isn't a marker or an arrow";;
Thelitedragon#4507;09-Jun-18 03:24 PM;The first boss in IV as well;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:24 PM;Backtracking in the first hours of the game is either impossible or unrequired;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:24 PM;Ok cool.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:25 PM;Ha I used runic a lot. Made certain bosses and encounters a total joke.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:26 PM;"I needed to record the bosses skills, having them nullified would have been annoying for my vidz ^^";;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:27 PM;"Otherwise, even when you leave Midgard, if there is nothing to do in a place, it means you don't have to be there for now";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:29 PM;Oh that’s a good point.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:29 PM;How will I know if there’s something to do?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:30 PM;"Something will happen, or you will be told to go there";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:30 PM;Ok cool.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:30 PM;"But usually, it's along the way";;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:30 PM;"People complained about FF13 being only hallways after hallways, but FF7 was actually rather close in that design";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:31 PM;I’m kinda happy about that.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;09-Jun-18 03:31 PM;It's definitely a game where you won't get lost;;
Thelitedragon#4507;09-Jun-18 03:32 PM;But the feeling of adventure is definitely dimmed when you don't even have the chance to go around to other places and do sidequests;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:32 PM;Except for two spots apparently.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:32 PM;I finished 6 less than 48 hours ago. I’m totally ok with being told where to go right now.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:33 PM;Getting all 14 peeps in WoR was a slog. Leveling them all up and getting all the good gear for each one was a straight grind at the end.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:34 PM;Granted I literally had never experienced turn based combat before VI... so it took a while for me to figure out what the fuck was going on.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:35 PM;"Oh right, the characters that aren't in battles still get some exp";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:36 PM;In VII;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:36 PM;"I forgot the formula but even if you only grind 3 characters to 99, the other characters will level up at a slower pace. I remember having them between 68 and 75 in my 1st playthrough";;

Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:36 PM;"Yes, in 7";;

Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:38 PM;"If you don't count the 2 hidden characters, yes";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:41 PM;And max 3 to a battle?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:42 PM;Exactly;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jun-18 03:42 PM;"Same as FF8, but you can get 4 in FF9";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:42 PM;and 4 in FFVI;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jun-18 03:43 PM;"Again, I compare everything to VI because it’s the only one I’ve played.";;

Sclipzer#0168;11-Jun-18 08:29 AM;Summon materias have really big stat debuffs as well;;
Sclipzer#0168;11-Jun-18 08:30 AM;Also for the all materias iirc the amount of times you can all-cast a spell in a battle depends on the materia level and the magic power is decreased;;
pokemongenius#1474;11-Jun-18 08:48 AM;Yeah using spread magic is always weaker over single target. All must be leveled up to increase the amount of times a linked magic can be used on multiple targets;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Jun-18 11:19 AM;"Yeah, same as it was in VI. Casting over all targets hits for less damage.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Jun-18 11:20 AM;"See, if you just relate everything to VI, we'll be good.";;
pokemongenius#1474;11-Jun-18 02:11 PM;In the remake of FF1 ra spells are only multi hit and damage rolls heavily influence that game. The ra spells are better even if there multi hit but there cost is absurd;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;13-Jun-18 08:31 AM;Same with 12;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;13-Jun-18 08:31 AM;I usually have people start with 10 or 7;;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-18 09:09 AM;Its bad in the sense that its poorly executed. The Junction system was not balanced at all so breaking the game is easy and therefore boring. The game outside of that is fine its hard to get invested early on cuzz Squall is so anti social but it gets better.;;
RazorBlack#8566;13-Jun-18 09:38 AM;Oh no I'm a fan of the series but I have been on the fence with buying 8. And this is coming from someone who thought 13 was pretty decent;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;13-Jun-18 09:45 AM;They skipped that entry;;

pokemongenius#1474;13-Jun-18 02:52 PM;Not can be it is exceptionally harder;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;13-Jun-18 04:20 PM;If you know what you're doing you can snap the game's difficulty in half and breeeeeze through the final boss.;;

Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jun-18 07:18 AM;"@Maximilian#8443 Moogles were supposed to appear in FF2 at the same time as the chocobos. But they were replaced by some beavers instead and postponed to FF3, and even then, they were really minor npcs.";;
Aruu#2066;14-Jun-18 07:18 AM;I believe they're technically fairies.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jun-18 07:19 AM;Their original name is a portmanteaux for Mogura which means Mole and Komori which means Bat;;

Carmine#9363;15-Jun-18 04:34 PM;"Shikari/Knight isn't so great, you lose out on Mystic Armor, which is vital to boost the damage of the Knight or Shikari. Knight TBM is also not so great because it doubles up on Heavy Armor and doesn't do much for TBM other than giving them the ability to use swords and shield";;
Carmine#9363;15-Jun-18 04:37 PM;"My personal favorite combo is Knight/Bushi because it gives Knight access to Mystic Armor (think Excalibur + Genji Gloves + White Robes + Black Mask), and with esper allocation, access to enough magic to become  a useful side healer.";;
Carmine#9363;15-Jun-18 04:38 PM;"But if you're already a Shikari, then some good Shikari combos are Shikari/Red Mage, Shikari/Bushi, Shikari/Foebreaker. The latter two are kind of a boring role since it's a DPS bot with no magic, but your call.";;
Carmine#9363;15-Jun-18 04:39 PM;Shikari Red Mage is great because it gives access to Mystic Armor which is in a word vital for characters whose ultimate weapons are holy/dark elemental because of white and black robes boosting their DPS by 50%;;
Carmine#9363;15-Jun-18 04:40 PM;It also gives Shikari something to do with their MP pool;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Jun-18 01:59 PM;I’d say VI but I’m biased. I thought it was a great game and definitely not too crazy once I got the hang of it.;;

Sunny#7174;16-Jun-18 02:06 PM;VI is a great one for beginners;;

curls224#5819;19-Jun-18 06:19 PM;So I have question I was once in a thrift shop and found a cloud strife cardboard cutout I went to buy it the next month but it wasn't there so I ask was that cardboard cutout worth anything?;;

ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:35 AM;I kinda wonder if someone might have a list of which bosses have morph rewards.;;
ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:35 AM;I got super pissed off that the experiment monster in Hojo's lab gave nothing after five failed attempts.;;
Schwahn#2217;20-Jun-18 11:36 AM;Should have had something like that included with the read-me files;;
ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:36 AM;Yeah. It takes so much risk to morph a boss.;;
Schwahn#2217;20-Jun-18 11:36 AM;You could also check the official thread for the mod;;

ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:53 AM;That'd be nice.;;
ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:53 AM;Just the list of what's morphable;;
ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:53 AM;I like the surprise;;

ChipNoir#3597;20-Jun-18 11:55 AM;Yep.;;
Schwahn#2217;20-Jun-18 11:55 AM;Remember that most bosses have slightly tweaked names and there are new bosses added;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:20 AM;Of course that was eight years ago;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:20 AM;I have since played it properly;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:20 AM;Also great to know;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:22 AM;"I also wanted to point out the strategy you gave as an example for Vercingetorix pretty much only works against it, can be done with characters other than Vanille (although I wouldn't recommend two of the options in question) and doesn't work if you have  decently-developed characters and are aiming for 5 Stars (IIRC a requirement for an achievement)";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:23 AM;That's not the point;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:23 AM;The point is that you can cheese a superboss with little to no danger to yourself;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:23 AM;The other superboss at the end of titan's trials was actually kinda hard;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:24 AM;You really think you can't do that in X ?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:24 AM;And the shao long gui? Who knows. I didn't fight it.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:24 AM;Or in XII ?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:24 AM;Yeah I'm reasonably certain. At least so far.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:24 AM;"Also, doing that with *actually* no danger to yourself costs a whopping 4 Elixirs";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:24 AM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:28 AM;"Just so you know, you can use an instant-death move on pretty much anything in FFX";;

Thelitedragon#4507;23-Jun-18 01:29 AM;Yojimbo?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:29 AM;Wakka doesn't one-shot something just because it's flying;;

Thelitedragon#4507;23-Jun-18 01:30 AM;Like what;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:30 AM;"Yeah, that's the great thing about Yojimbo";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:30 AM;You can just manipulate him;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Jun-18 01:30 AM;Used him to one shot the final boss' second stage though;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Jun-18 01:30 AM;Stupid gimmicky summon;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Jun-18 01:30 AM;That was nice;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:42 AM;I have no idea;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:42 AM;I downloaded a definitely legal copy because my PS3 is broke and I'm not spending 100 bucks on a new one;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 01:42 AM;So no chieves for me;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 06:19 AM;"it's not about the achievements, it's about getting Lulu's ultimate weapon lol";;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 06:20 AM;"and her ultimate weapon isn't even worth it. She has the worst WORST limit break in the game for post-game stuff. Like, just hands down, the worst limit break. I'm so sorry big tiddy goth bby";;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Jun-18 08:35 AM;Its 200 strikes for the curious;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:37 AM;no thank you sir;;
Trickster#9840;23-Jun-18 08:37 AM;"Yeah it's recommended to custom make something for lulu with mag+20%, one mp cost, turbo mp, and something else";;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:38 AM;Probably Break Damage Limit;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:38 AM;I mean that would make sense;;
Trickster#9840;23-Jun-18 08:38 AM;That's auto on the ffx remaster;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:38 AM;?;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:38 AM;You can naturally break damage limit?;;
Trickster#9840;23-Jun-18 08:38 AM;Is that just for aeons?;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:39 AM;afaik the ultimate weapons still have that glued into them;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 08:39 AM;so if there's a natural break damage limit that makes the ultimate weapons crap;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jun-18 08:43 AM;"Nope, there are only 3 aeons that can naturally break damage but that's always been the case: Bahamut, Anima and Magus sisters";;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jun-18 08:43 AM;The 5 others still need the corresponding ultimate weapons to break damage limit;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jun-18 08:43 AM;Lulu's being one of those;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jun-18 08:55 AM;"And the characters still need a damage break on their weapons to go above 9999, even with the cheats in the Remaster Steam version";;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Jun-18 09:25 AM;The damage limit sets a flag that allows you to go beyond 9999 without that flag your stuck at 9999;;
Carmine#9363;23-Jun-18 10:40 AM;that's what I thought;;
Sclipzer#0168;23-Jun-18 02:53 PM;"Bahamut can only break it with his overdrive as well, not with normal attacks";;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jun-18 04:15 PM;Anybody know some good performance tweak mods for FFXV? I've already got Special K.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jun-18 04:16 PM;My computer more than exceeds the recommended so I'm fine with that but just any bugs or such.;;
ChipNoir#3597;23-Jun-18 08:57 PM;Is there a mod or something that can get the PC version of VII to run in windowed mode?;;
Maximilian#8443;23-Jun-18 09:26 PM;Can I still buy a physical copy of ff14?;;
Maximilian#8443;23-Jun-18 09:26 PM;Or will my friends game code work with the digital version;;
Lushis#6255;23-Jun-18 10:39 PM;Does anyone have recommendations on which final fantasy I should go for next after I beat seven? I've beaten ff9 and ff6 in the past and I prefer story over gameplay but I do think gameplay is very important.;;
Maximilian#8443;23-Jun-18 10:40 PM;Which one did you like the most;;
Lushis#6255;23-Jun-18 10:41 PM;6;;
Maximilian#8443;23-Jun-18 10:41 PM;4 or 5;;
Maximilian#8443;23-Jun-18 10:41 PM;Is what I'd recommend;;
Lushis#6255;23-Jun-18 10:41 PM;Thank you;;
Maximilian#8443;23-Jun-18 10:42 PM;"It has the classic ff vibe still, ff5 has a fun job system";;
Lushis#6255;23-Jun-18 10:43 PM;For 4 I've heard the Super Nintendo version lacks too much challenge so should I get the steam/ds version instead?;;
ChipNoir#3597;23-Jun-18 10:57 PM;Or the GBA or PSP version.;;
Lushis#6255;23-Jun-18 11:04 PM;So I should avoid the SNES original?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jun-18 11:16 PM;By all accounts the SNES original is brainless and easy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Jun-18 11:21 PM;the difficulty of all of the 2D versions are more or less the same;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Jun-18 11:21 PM;with the only one different is the english SNES release which was a bit easier than it already was;;
ChipNoir#3597;23-Jun-18 11:37 PM;"And by a bit, that means a total cakewalk.";;
Carmine#9363;24-Jun-18 12:48 AM;4 has a shit ton of story because there are like 3 other games;;
Carmine#9363;24-Jun-18 12:48 AM;there's the afterstory and a prequel to 4 and there's remakes out the ass;;
Burnero gangstero#4162;24-Jun-18 04:53 AM;Is ff xiv good;;
Sweet Darling#3671;24-Jun-18 04:53 AM;Depends;;
Burnero gangstero#4162;24-Jun-18 04:55 AM;I may purchase a ps4 with it soon;;
Carmine#9363;24-Jun-18 08:07 AM;FFXIV is great if you like WoW but prettier;;
Carmine#9363;24-Jun-18 08:07 AM;and with FF references/lore;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Jun-18 10:25 AM;XIV is simply the best subscription-based MMO on the mamrket;;
InfernalMachine#2461;24-Jun-18 10:28 AM;"During this current Steam sale, I bought FF15 and FF12, because my friend highly recommended them. I found that I really like them a lot.

Baguette Cat#6233;24-Jun-18 10:28 AM;"9 and 10, mostly";;

AbroadKew#1016;24-Jun-18 10:48 AM;It does not seem... good?;;

Klay78#3245;24-Jun-18 07:31 PM;"Does anyone know if there is a difference between attacking an enemy vs using GF summons in ff8? Its odd being that gf summons obviously do more damage, so why not always use them? Is there a drawback to that?";;
Trickster#9840;24-Jun-18 08:28 PM;They'll take damage while you're summoning and can be KO'd if you're not careful. Also if you're properly utilizing the junction system you'll eventually do way more damage with physical attacks.;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jun-18 08:38 PM;Your gonna be more overpowered never summon;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 03:29 AM;"if they die while you're summoning them, they lose affection";;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 03:29 AM;GFs with low affection take longer to summon;;
pokemongenius#1474;25-Jun-18 06:25 AM;Hardly any issue spam magic that corresponds to that summons element;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:15 AM;that's...not how it really works;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:15 AM;You just keep using them to increase affection;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:15 AM;because doomtrain and cactuar don't have elements?;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:15 AM;or just win battles with them equipped;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:16 AM;Doomtrain is poison/bio;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:17 AM;regardless the best way to do it is just by summoning them;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:18 AM;"But yeah, the same goes for tonberry, it doesn't have an element attached like Cactuar";;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:18 AM;using magic increases it by like 1/7th the rate of casting magic;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:18 AM;and magic is better off junctioned than used;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:18 AM;so...;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:18 AM;and GFs are decent to rely on;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:18 AM;other than the amnesia side effect 😦;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:19 AM;which your characters would have even if you never junctioned a GF because lolplot;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:19 AM;It's implied they used them before the game takes place;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:22 AM;even though the tutorial on how to use them is canon right when you start playing;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:23 AM;"and you junction Quetz and Shiva right then and there by picking them up at your class terminal, but lol";;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:23 AM;actually you don't even junction them there;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:23 AM;and Zell and Selphie don't come with a GF etc;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:23 AM;so;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:23 AM;kind of weak plot point but meh;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:23 AM;I digress;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:25 AM;They are in the last year of their scholarship;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:26 AM;You won't make me believe they never used g-force before;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:26 AM;And Seifer uses a spell in the intro;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:26 AM;You can't unless you junction a g-force;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:26 AM;"And they have to pass a graduation test really soon in the game, and the whole game proceeds from there";;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:27 AM;"So yeah, the tutorials are cheaply inserted";;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:30 AM;"I don't know how it was localized in the US/english version, but in the french, it's asked if you remember how to junction g-forces and commands, at which you can just answer Yes or No need for this";;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:55 AM;that's not a spell;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:55 AM;that's his limit break he used;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:55 AM;you can use limit breaks without a GF...;;

Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:58 AM;humans in FF8 can't use magic spells at all;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Jun-18 07:58 AM;Unless they get a g-force;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:58 AM;it's still his limit break;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;and Seifer doesn't have a Guardian Force when he's in your party;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;so???????????;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;and you can't junction him...lol;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;he's guardian forceless and still uses that fire spell;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;which is his limit break;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;:No Mercy;;
Carmine#9363;25-Jun-18 07:59 AM;look it u;;

Th3UltimateGamer#6545;01-Jul-18 06:38 AM;"So i asked this over in the questions subreddit but ill copy paste it here to get more opinion. reddit hasnt answered yet.  Hi Guys, im a newcomer here and wanted to know what to play first. I was most interested in FFIII and FFVI, and was wondering which of the 2 to play although i plan on playing both and more if i like what i see, also should i play 3 on DS or NES. Thanks guys, , Edit: There are more than 2 platforms for 3 i now realise, just give me wat u think is best";;
Aruu#2066;01-Jul-18 06:39 AM;FFVI is a good bet to play first.;;
Bounty#0474;01-Jul-18 06:40 AM;"FFIII uses the typical turn-based combat, so it can be a shock going from it to the active time combat that was introduced in FFIV. I would personally recommend FFVI. It's really good, and it's a good starting point!";;
Th3UltimateGamer#6545;01-Jul-18 06:41 AM;So go backwards then;;
Aruu#2066;01-Jul-18 06:42 AM;There's no need to play the games in order in the slightest.;;
Th3UltimateGamer#6545;01-Jul-18 06:44 AM;So any beginners advice for 6?;;
Bounty#0474;01-Jul-18 06:47 AM;"I'd really just say to play it blind. Don't worry about maxing out stats, or getting the absolute best items. Just play it!";;
Bounty#0474;01-Jul-18 06:49 AM;"And about the order, it's not so much the order, so much as that only 3 games in the series use the straight turn based combat, so it's not necessarily the best idea to play the turn based ones and think they are all like them.";;
Bounty#0474;01-Jul-18 06:49 AM;I made that mistake with FFI and II. Probably shouldn't have started with those.;;
Th3UltimateGamer#6545;01-Jul-18 07:37 AM;"thx. tryin out a new series, been playin jjrpgs lately and figured id try out what started it all";;
Bounty#0474;01-Jul-18 07:40 AM;Good luck! ~~I'm not going to get into the origin of jrpgs cause that'll just be a mess~~;;
Th3UltimateGamer#6545;01-Jul-18 07:47 AM;Haha lol;;
Th3UltimateGamer#6545;01-Jul-18 08:01 AM;"How much character customization is in VI, I really liked the idea of the job system from the previous ones, what kind of classes and abilities are there?";;
Aruu#2066;01-Jul-18 08:02 AM;"Characters can learn most spells after a certain point in the game, but they all have unique abilities that are unique to them only.";;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Jul-18 08:23 AM;Gogo is my favorite since you can customize his abilities its funny using Blitz;;

Baguette Cat#6233;02-Jul-18 03:22 PM;"But since they also reduced the difference back in FF11, they somewhat dropped that too for 14 in the 2.0.";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;02-Jul-18 03:22 PM;They went from minuscule differences to literally no differences;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;02-Jul-18 03:23 PM;There used to be like tiny elemental resistances for each race but it was already being ignored by 3.0 content because it literally did not matter;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;02-Jul-18 03:25 PM;Love how summoner works;;

Malfred#1000;03-Jul-18 12:36 AM;I remember Kraken clubs being a big thing among hackers because of how you could cheese nms;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jul-18 12:37 AM;And because Se seemingly didn't care whether they were obtained legally or not;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;03-Jul-18 09:51 AM;Yeah;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;03-Jul-18 09:52 AM;Kraken club was like a 0.1% drop from a hard bcnm;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;03-Jul-18 09:52 AM;Gil though was a problem since they can use that to buy items for multiple mythics and relics the best weapons in the game;;

pokemongenius#1474;04-Jul-18 03:15 PM;5 and 6 are better played on SNES/GBA simply due to the experience being more faithful and enjoyable to the source.;;
pokemongenius#1474;04-Jul-18 03:16 PM;Otherwise any FF game on PC currently is very much enjoyable ive heard wind that some games were not optimized for the PC I believe its 13 so do keep that in mind;;

WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:23 PM;"I've played, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,14,15,tactics, and type-0.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:23 PM;That’s a lot;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:23 PM;I want to play IV;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:23 PM;4 is really good;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:23 PM;The after years not so much;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:24 PM;Type-0 sounds good too;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:24 PM;Type-0 is a good real time ff;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:24 PM;I heard;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:25 PM;15 should've been more like type 0 tbh;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:25 PM;"I want to play the original three as well., I didn’t want to get 15. They changed the plot completely and they got rid of Stella";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;The original 3?;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;FF 1-3;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;2 is really bad;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;I heard but I wanna play it anyways lol;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;I strongly advise against playing the original 2;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;"1 and 3, okay, but not FF2";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;1 is fun;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;A bit grindy;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:26 PM;The original or remaster?;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:27 PM;If you're gonna play ff1. Do the psp version;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:27 PM;"Not so much, you have to avoid reaching above level 15 before upgrading your classes, though";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:27 PM;Ahh;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:27 PM;All the money grind;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:28 PM;"I think you can do that with a level 13 at best, but under that, it gets reaaaaaaaaaaaaalllyyyyy hard to get past some parts";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:28 PM;Cause like spells cost hella cash;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:28 PM;Wow that sucks;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:28 PM;"Money wise.... yeah, it feels like it at first";;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:28 PM;But it gets almost useless past level 24;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:28 PM;Or so;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:29 PM;"Can't remember exactly, I'm sitting on the max gils with 99 of all consumables and still haven't started the last dungeon";;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:30 PM;"I made a video explaining the subtleties of the FF main games until FF9 included, but my mic, thus my voice over, and editing skills were really lacking. It'd make you drowsy ^^";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:30 PM;Lol;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:32 PM;Lolol;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:33 PM;"I still have to get my lazy ass to work on an opening and ending, but for now, I'm dealing with Kefka";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:33 PM;Kefka is bae;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:33 PM;Best FF villain;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:34 PM;You'd be surprised at how neatly they remade him for FF14;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:34 PM;I still discover interesting things;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:34 PM;Ohhh! 😍;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:35 PM;He looks amazing ❤️;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:36 PM;They even kept the crispy FF6 SNES audio for his intro laugh;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:36 PM;Ahh that laugh ❤️;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:37 PM;"I think people type it as Holo holo holo, or something";;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;"But yeah, I'm dissecting the FF14 encounter (the 2 difficulties) and try to find where does this or that mechanic comes from in FF6";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;Ff14 is great;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;I heard it’s amazing;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;It is;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;My favorite mmorpg;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;I only don't wanna play FF14 because $20 only gets you a month of playtime;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;"They didn't stop at the FF6 battles only, they even went for some moments in cutscenes to turn them into mechanics/skills in FF14";;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;And while that makes sense;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;It's cheapter than 20;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:38 PM;It's like 14;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Either way;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Wow that cheap;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;I thought it was free tho;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;I don't find it worth it since I'd have a lot of games to play right now;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;It isn't free;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;You can get to level 35 with a trial version;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Oh well;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;"Tons of FF games, RPGs, stuff like that";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;You get a few free months for buying the game;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;But can't unlock the expansion's jobs;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Ahh I see;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Yeah I've given the trial a spin but it's frustrating how you can't friend anyone;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:40 PM;That sucks;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:40 PM;I only have one other friend I wanna play with but we can't join so I'm not having a lot of fun;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:40 PM;I typically don’t play mmorpg;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:40 PM;Yeah that's just how the trial is;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:41 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:41 PM;Either way I just don't like monthly subscriptions since I would feel pressured to *only* play that game to get the most out of it;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:41 PM;I think you can pause the subscription;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:41 PM;"I got my MMO fix with an SAO game on my Vita, even if it wasn't very multiplayer";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:41 PM;I would feel pressured too. Plus I have other games to play;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:41 PM;"I get where you're coming from, I used to do that only with WoW";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:42 PM;I def wanna get back into 14. But I'm gonna need a keyboard and mouse;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:43 PM;"I mean I *may* get FFXIV sometime if you can pause the subscription sometimes and still have days left in it when you resume, but eh, still not a fan of the model";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:43 PM;Pretty sure you can;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:45 PM;"Not in that way, he means Paying for 30 days, asking to pause after playing 15 days, coming back 10 days later and still have those last 15 days left to play";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:45 PM;Ahhh;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:46 PM;Yeah you can;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:46 PM;Really 🤔;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:46 PM;Huh;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:47 PM;"Unless you play in China, I'm really not sure. They have laws against subscriptions so you only pay for the time you play. But that requires a chinese account, and playing on chinese servers";;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:47 PM;Guess I'm moving to China ¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:48 PM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 please, tell him it's a bad idea";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:48 PM;*besides why would you buy the subscription for more than a month at a time.*;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:48 PM;Lol;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:48 PM;😅;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:50 PM;"There is a 11 euros (or dollars, can't say, I'm french) formula, you can only pay month by month, but it limits you to 1 character per server, with... 10 characters max (I forgot exactly)";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:50 PM;That's only the beginning one;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:50 PM;The regular one let's you do more for the same price;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:50 PM;Well *2 dollars more*;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:51 PM;I guess the big thing holding me back is the fact I don't play many PC games;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:51 PM;And I don't have a PS4;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:51 PM;so;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:53 PM;I'd be fine with it if FFXIV used PS+ cause then I pay more for multiplayer for way more games;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:54 PM;I don’t play PC games either;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:54 PM;*I don't own a pc*;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:55 PM;"Oh right, that pay to play online bullshit -__-";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:55 PM;That sucks;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:55 PM;It's not *that* bad;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 01:55 PM;"Yeah still wouldn't like it, but I would atleast feel like it's more worth it";;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 01:56 PM;Atleast it isn't microsoft. *Need gold to be in a party*;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;08-Jul-18 01:56 PM;That’s true;;
Baguette Cat#6233;08-Jul-18 01:57 PM;"Now I feel somewhat bad, I don't want to give you my vidz, because you might want to play 14 😦";;

WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 02:04 PM;You can iirc;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 02:04 PM;Take most of what I say with a grain of salt;;
Poptheweasel100#8187;08-Jul-18 02:05 PM;Well I'll try sometime;;
WweirdohH#8364;08-Jul-18 02:39 PM;Anybody got a good ffvii 100% guide?;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:34 PM;What you need on VI?;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:35 PM;so how EXACTLY can i get shadow to join me during the floating continent part after i beat Atma weapon?;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:35 PM;do i just have to wait until 0:05;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:35 PM;Are you asking about the whole “wait” thing?;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:35 PM;yea;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:35 PM;is there any way i might mess it up;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:35 PM;"Yeah. So at the end of that dungeon, just select wait and chill.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:36 PM;"At about 0:04, shadow will roll up and then you’re good.";;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:36 PM;"sweet, thanks dude";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:36 PM;"As long as you select wait, and just literally stand there, you’re good.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:36 PM;Shadow is meh if you don't have shurikens;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:36 PM;Or something to throw;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:37 PM;made him throw old weapons i don't use anymore;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:37 PM;"lol i just want shadow bcs hes a badass, his stats might suck but he's just a cool character";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:37 PM;I don't think his stats suck;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:38 PM;He just aint appealing as lets say Sabin;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:38 PM;its mainly because hes suuuPPEr underleveled compared to everyone else in my party;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:38 PM;Yeah he comes and goes which is an issue;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:38 PM;Late game shadow is better than Sabin.;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;"i have locke. edgar, and terra";;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;with me;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;the enemies here are so hard ffs;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;"I use Locke, Terra, Sabin and Edgar";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;Endgame;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;Was thinking about Celes but meeeeeeeeeeeeh;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;Terra does the same shit;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;Except lacks runic;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:39 PM;i ended up dying and now im back at the start of floating continent aaahh;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:40 PM;"Relm, Terra, and Celes are awesome end game.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:40 PM;Locke needs some really rare gear to be really good but it pays off;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:40 PM;i have this useful grind method where i just keep fighting every enemy until the drop to the airship;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:40 PM;Relm is also completely indispensable for power leveling if you so choose.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:40 PM;Gave him master scroll and valliant knife;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:40 PM;its a kinda annoying cycle but eehh it works;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;oh shit i need to buy some scrolls;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;It's a relic;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;Yeah;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;Iirc you only get 1 master scroll;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;and like 2-3 genji gloves;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;Valiant knife is Locke’s jam.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;Yes. Only one master scroll.;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:41 PM;FFVI feels IMO much more polished than VII;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;I’m playing VII for the first time as we speak. I agree.;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;"i havent beat it yet, but it feels nice";;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;VII is awesome;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;it takes a lot from VI;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;Vi is just a masterpiece.;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;^^^;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;"That Yeti dude is pretty ASS, but he has one really good thing";;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;"VII was my first Final Fantasy, its SOO good man";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;Yup. VII is really good so far. But I can’t imagine it’ll overtake VI for me.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:42 PM;In the cult tower he can physically attack;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:43 PM;which is actually useful but other than that he aint worth it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:43 PM;Umaro;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:43 PM;"I think everyones first FF is their favorite, From what ive seen.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:43 PM;except mine;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:43 PM;My first FF was IV but V is my favorite;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:43 PM;Gogo and Umaro are both pretty weak in my opinion.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;Gogo is ass;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;He mimics other attacks;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;but he doesn't have the stats to actually get the best of it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;Well. He can mimic ultima which isn’t too bad.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;True;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;Or grand train.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;Via Strago;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;"my first FF was VII, and I'm currently playing thru VI, i plan to do either IX or IV";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:44 PM;Strago meh;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:46 PM;Cyan is borderline useless. Setzer is only good once you get his “ultimate weapon” in the final dungeon.;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:47 PM;At endgame i kept hitting 9999 with Terra;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:47 PM;Ha. Chainsaw gets a little weak late game. But it’s completely outrageous for the first 3/4ths of the game.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:47 PM;To the point i stopped using trance;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:47 PM;I think FFVII or FFVI are mandatory for anyone who claims they like RPG's;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:47 PM;Yeah. Terra and relm are the most OP magic characters.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:48 PM;Dude. VI changed my perception of video games. I shit you not.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:48 PM;VI is my shit;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:51 PM;The opera scene is unreal.;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:51 PM;"and then he hit himself,  THE ONE time i felt bad for him";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:51 PM;The opera scene was too good;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:51 PM;Honestly my top 3 favorite places in the game;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Jul-18 07:51 PM;What are your others?;;
abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:51 PM;the opera scene stumps almost every other character bonding scene from VII;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:52 PM;My others would be Zozo;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:52 PM;I found it hilarios;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:52 PM;how i use locke to rob a robber;;

abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:52 PM;"the clock puzzle was weird, but cool";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:52 PM;And my favorite place would be honestly the cult tower;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:52 PM;Well 2nd;;

abutchera#3536;08-Jul-18 07:53 PM;i want it to last lol;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;08-Jul-18 07:53 PM;And climbing up was pretty fun;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jul-18 03:53 PM;It's one of the tougher boss fights in the game now that I remember it.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jul-18 03:53 PM;"Focus on the lower ones first since they have elemental weaknesses, it gets easier with only 2 afterwards";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jul-18 03:54 PM;Edgar's bioblaster thing works well too if I remember;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Jul-18 03:54 PM;Not.... really.... I'm a kind of guy who'll spend quite some time to teach all skills and spells available to my characters whenever I can... so maybe I'm usually overleveled;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jul-18 03:55 PM;then switch to drill or chainsaw once you get down to one or two tentacles.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jul-18 03:55 PM;"Ha, yes... if you're overleveled then you'll be fine in any part of VI.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Jul-18 03:55 PM;"but if you're at level, that's a tough fight.";;
abutchera#3536;09-Jul-18 03:56 PM;"sabin and celes are both level 25, so i kinda need to grind lol";;

MABF5#8126;10-Jul-18 03:39 AM;Hey all! I was thinking of picking up either VI or VII on ios. I haven’t played either and would like some advice on which one to get.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;10-Jul-18 03:50 AM;I'd say totally pick up VII;;
Thelitedragon#4507;10-Jul-18 03:50 AM;But take a hard look at the graphics of VI;;
Thelitedragon#4507;10-Jul-18 03:51 AM;If you can take it I'd recommend vi instead;;
MABF5#8126;10-Jul-18 03:53 AM;I’m fine with the graphics. I’m more concerned with the gameplay and story haha;;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 04:22 AM;"hey guys,i'm currently playing FF5 and i have just reached the water crystal in which i have received the new jobs (time mage,summoner etc.) my question is: should i switch the past jobs with these new ones ?";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jul-18 04:27 AM;Only if you want to use the new jobs;;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 04:32 AM;no i mean like are the new jobs better than the older ones or it's just preference ?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:36 AM;FF5 doesn't really work like that;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:36 AM;"There are some jobs worse than others, true";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:36 AM;"But even like that, they still have some relevant passive skills";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:37 AM;"As long as you try to keep at least a healer, either a white mage or someone set with the white magic ability, you can swap them";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:37 AM;"You'll still have, at some point, to stop a bit and level up job levels";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:40 AM;"It's quite a spoiler but each job that you master have their passive skills becoming part of the Freelancer and Mime jobs, with some rare exception like the Knight's Two-handed that still needs to be set";;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 04:43 AM;understood;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jul-18 04:44 AM;Almost all jobs give you a mastery passive;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jul-18 04:44 AM;"Shields, Swords, Daggers, Maces, Staves, etcs.";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jul-18 04:44 AM;"Once you obtain those, your Freelancer learns them permanently";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:44 AM;"Let's say that the most useful short term wise, are the physical hitters like Knight, Samurai, Dragoon, Black, White and eventually Blue mages";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jul-18 04:45 AM;Meaning they can eventually use all weapon types.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 04:46 AM;"But quite farther in game, you'll need to level up the jobs that have a realllly strong last level passive skill, like Red mage for its Dual spell, Ranger for its Rapid Fire, Dancer for its Equip Ribbon";;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 05:44 AM;but the last level passive skills can be only applied to freelancers ?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:51 AM;"You need to equip them to the other jobs, only the Freelancer and the Mime benefit from the passives if the job is mastered.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:52 AM;"Example: I master Ninja with, say, Faris.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:53 AM;"Now, if I go back to Freelancer with Faris, she'll be able to use a weapon in each hand, as if I had set the Twin handed skill";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:53 AM;But without having to actually set Twin handed 😄;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:54 AM;"Other classes like Dragoon, or Samurai, if you want to use 2 weapons, you'll need to set the Twin handed skill first";;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 05:55 AM;"cool,so which jobs do you suggest me to master ?";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:56 AM;"I'd say all of them. It sounds grindy as fuck, but there are monsters that grant you a lot of AP. The last part of the last story dungeon has monsters that only give AP., All in all, you'd want to have 2 casters and 2 physical hitters.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:57 AM;"So try to master physical classes with 2 characters, and get the Ranger last skill Rapid Fire";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 05:57 AM;"And master magic with the other 2, and the Dual Cast red mage last skill";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:00 AM;"Dancer is nice for the Equip Ribbon skill, the Ribbons help by negating almost all ailments (save for slow). Not really mandatory, but it can make some late encounters easier.";;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 06:01 AM;"but there's something that doesn't convice me,red mage is the job that allows a character to use both black and white magic right ?";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:01 AM;Only until rank 3;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:01 AM;The spells above the 3rd rank can't be used by the red mage;;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 06:02 AM;oh;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:02 AM;"So, it can be interesting as long as you haven't unlocked any 4th rank spell, it's true";;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 06:05 AM;but technically what is the final team supposed to look like ? all freelancers with all passive abilities or maxed jobs with other passive abilities ?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:05 AM;Close;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:06 AM;2 Freelancers and 2 Mimes;;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 06:06 AM;mimes ?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:06 AM;"Yeah, the last job in the original game";;
DrIsaac#3812;10-Jul-18 06:07 AM;so the 2 freelancers are the physical attackers while the 2 mimes are the magical one ?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:07 AM;"The mime can set 3 skills, whereas the Freelancer can set only 2";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:08 AM;"So the Mime can set 2 magic skills like Black/White/Blue magic and/or summon, with Dual Cast";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:09 AM;The Freelancer set Rapid Fire and I forgot the other skill;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jul-18 06:16 AM;"Yeah, the second one is a put what you want. I have one Freelancer character with Steal and the other with Jump... I don't even remember why";;

Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 05:00 PM;"Although, considering the not good translation in english, you should open a guide to get Vincent, as the clues and such are.... hard to get by";;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 05:01 PM;There is just 1 part of the main story where having Yuffie can offer some advantage if you unlocked her;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 05:03 PM;"Because you're a 2 man team at that moment, and Yuffie becomes the 3rd if you recruited her";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 05:13 PM;I have her now;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 05:14 PM;Just about to get into Gongaga I think;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 05:15 PM;Think I’m most of the way through disc 1;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 05:15 PM;"At least the half, yeah";;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Jul-18 05:55 PM;Getting Vin was weird for me my sister just kinda knew the safe code from out of nowhere no hints no internet just kinda knew. Weird but cool moment;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:09 PM;How?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:09 PM;Guessed?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:10 PM;I want to power through a bunch of it tonight.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:10 PM;Probably can’t finish disc one but I can probably get through a bunch of sections.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:11 PM;"After Gongaga, you'll spend a lot of time in Cosmo Canyon";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:11 PM;I like to binge play this game.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:11 PM;"Even so, it's an interesting part";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:12 PM;I’d like to get through rocket town;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:12 PM;Tonight;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:13 PM;Uuuuuh....;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:13 PM;"If you're still at Gongaga, you'll need some times";;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:14 PM;Unless you skip all text;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:15 PM;How much time?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:15 PM;What time is it currently for you ?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:15 PM;I have a few hours at least.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:15 PM;4:15pm;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:17 PM;"Yeah, I don't think you'll make it tonight, even if you're a fast reader";;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Jul-18 06:17 PM;Time to pull up that frame advance;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:17 PM;There's an interesting blue materia to get in the dungeon you'll do soon enough;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:23 PM;So there are a lot of cutscenes coming up?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:23 PM;Quite a lot;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:23 PM;"In Cosmo Canyon at least, and some in the next town";;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Jul-18 06:25 PM;What a fascinating story Red XIII said it best;;
Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 06:26 PM;The theme stays in mind for a while;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:26 PM;Ok. Well I’ll try to get as far as I can then.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:26 PM;I’m leaning on a guide to help out.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Jul-18 06:27 PM;Don't rely on a guide *too much*. It might spoil some things;;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Jul-18 06:27 PM;If you dont get Limit 3's in the forest with those mushroom enemies you need to fix that asap;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Jul-18 06:28 PM;He'll be fine;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:28 PM;"If I had more time to fuck around and explore, I would. But my playing time is pretty limited.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:28 PM;So a guide helps me get through a game in an acceptable amount of time.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 06:29 PM;I try to just use it for general direction.;;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Jul-18 06:32 PM;You must have a good non spoil guide;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 08:16 PM;i do actually;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Jul-18 08:16 PM;i know some of the major spoilers just because its an old game and you hear that stuff over time;;

nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 10:05 AM;so apparently I've been following a completionist FFXIII guide that's been intentionally underleveling my characters to make later missions easier.  is it even worth trying to switch guides/builds in chapter 10 if I just want to finish the story?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 10:43 AM;What kind of guide would do that...;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 10:43 AM;Can I see it ? It makes very little sense;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Jul-18 11:03 AM;How would underleveling do that;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 11:11 AM;I have no idea;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 11:11 AM;"Underleveling makes it easier to get 5 stars on a select few missions, but that's it";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Jul-18 11:34 AM;"I would understand for 8, but not for 13";;
nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 01:08 PM;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=329608927;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:09 PM;Where does it mention underleveling ?;;
nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 01:10 PM;"at the end of chapter 9, right before barthandelus";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:11 PM;"As I figured, it aims for 5-stars on missions";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:11 PM;This guide is atrocious from this paragraph alone;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:11 PM;Light/Hope/Fang for *Barthandelus* ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:11 PM;It's possibly the worst team for that fight;;
nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 01:11 PM;man;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:11 PM;Not to mention it's the second worst team for chapters 10+11;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:12 PM;"Sure It has every role and it never dies but as the most popularly used team, it is the cause of the widespread misconception that battles are long and tedious, but easily beatable";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:12 PM;Because it's such an overly defensive team for that point in the game;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:13 PM;So to answer your earlier question;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:13 PM;"If you just want to beat the story, yes, you can switch guides";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:14 PM;This one is an abomination;;
nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 01:14 PM;is switching now gonna screw me in terms of builds?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:15 PM;"It shouldn't, especially considering you're barely into Chapter 10 (I suppose)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:15 PM;Man this guide;;

nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 01:18 PM;"haha yeah in retrospect, there were some red flags";;
nearly#7704;22-Jul-18 01:19 PM;I guess that's what I get for just trying to follow a guide and not bothering to learn upgrades/progression myself;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:24 PM;Unfortunately I have no idea where to find a good guide;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Jul-18 01:24 PM;"Might have to make one myself, someday";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Jul-18 04:57 PM;"For most of the optional bosses in 10, you'll want armors with Auto Life, Auto Potion, Def + 20%, and the fourth slot either Auto Protect, or Stone Proof/Ribbon. Oh, and get rid of **all** of your potions and Hi-potions and only carry X-potions";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Jul-18 04:57 PM;"and yes, Auto Protect, Def+20% do stack even with Def at 255";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 09:40 PM;"I mean, if you're determined to play 9 then for sure get the PS4 remaster";;
Manga#8846;23-Jul-18 09:41 PM;"Definitely. ff9 is a really great game, it's got a lot of charm even to this day. The remastered version updates the graphics by a lot (obviously) and gives you the incentive of getting trophies. It also has cheats as well (just naming you some things the remaster has over the original) but I would definitely say without a doubt give ff9 a try, its an amazing game in my book @Metal Creed#5732";;
Metal Creed#5732;23-Jul-18 09:44 PM;damn that's a nice endorsement! i'll add it to my wish list then;;
Metal Creed#5732;23-Jul-18 09:47 PM;"also, I've heard that i should avoid the audio book that's included in the X/X-2 HD remaster that continues the story after X-2. should i actually avoid it?";;
Manga#8846;23-Jul-18 09:53 PM;"I mean... That's one thing I hate about some people in the final fantasy fanbase, they never give people the chance to form their own opinion about a particular game or any other work that they don't like. Definitely experience for yourself and form your own opinion about it.";;

Metal Creed#5732;23-Jul-18 09:55 PM;"Ok thanks, i'll keep that in mind!";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:12 PM;It goes both ways with the fanbase;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:13 PM;People who want to defend their game and ignore logical reasons why somebody doesn't like it;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:13 PM;And then people who bash others for having a opinion on a char or a aspect of a game;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:13 PM;I like Laguna;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:14 PM;I don't start a fight with somebody who doesn't like happy go lucky characters;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:17 PM;Which I understand tbh;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:18 PM;there is no protagonist in VI;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:21 PM;Semi squall;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:21 PM;Not a full dislike but I don't like him;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:21 PM;Squall is okay;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:22 PM;I hear but he doesn't click with me;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:22 PM;He’s cute but ehh;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:22 PM;He is just came off for most of the game to me as a standoff who had issues socializing;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:22 PM;Yeah I can see that;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:22 PM;Plus the romance with Squall and Rinoa....;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:23 PM;Doesn’t feel right;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:23 PM;It didn't;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:23 PM;He developed but it was slow;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:23 PM;Pace was not fast enough for me;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:23 PM;When you realize why he's like that eh;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:23 PM;Feels too late to warm up to him to like him for me;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:24 PM;It's why hes between the like and dislike in my head;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:25 PM;He does tbh;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:25 PM;He had more time to;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:25 PM;Yeah;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:26 PM;But yeah Laguna is my fav char from 8 I'm mainly upset he's not an actual playable char throughout the story;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:26 PM;Yeah me too. Plus he’s cute;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:26 PM;And hilarious;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:27 PM;Behind Tenzen;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:27 PM;She’s my fave monk;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:27 PM;The monk with the foul mouth;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:28 PM;Hell yeah xD;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:28 PM;She's amazing hope she returns next season;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:28 PM;Me too;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:28 PM;I used her a lot in Opera Omnia;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;In the leaks it said one returning char from 12;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;012;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;Its def yuna;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;I think it’s either Yuna or Prishe;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;She's the most popular of the chars scrapped;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;But mostly Yuna;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;I love Yuna;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;Same;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:29 PM;Now Tidus and Yuna can fight as a couple once again;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:30 PM;We are prob getting a ffxi villain;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;"I think so, and it’s new too";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;I can think of 2 good ones;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;Promithia and Lady Lith;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;Lady Lith;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;Yes;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;Lilith*;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:31 PM;Yeah Lilith xD;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:32 PM;But yeah one of those 2;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:32 PM;Lilith is the only villain I can think of;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:32 PM;Wings of the goddess and Chains of Promothia are the 2 loved expansions of that game;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:32 PM;Promithia and Lilith are the main antagonist of both;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:33 PM;Though there's one villain from rise of the zilart who's popular;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:33 PM;What villain is that?;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:34 PM;Eald'narche;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:34 PM;Hmmm;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:34 PM;He was pretty cool as one;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:34 PM;He’s all right. Not too bad;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:35 PM;His expansion was short and he didn't come off amazing;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:35 PM;So I speculate  the 2 I mentioned above;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:35 PM;Yup;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:35 PM;If I can't get prishe this season I need atleast one of the good villains;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:36 PM;^^^;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:37 PM;I wonder if we’re getting a second season;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:37 PM;They said to make a goal of 50 characters;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:38 PM;"We have 28 at launch and 6 DLC characters, so that’s 34";;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:39 PM;10 Auron;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:40 PM;"I want Aerith, Vivi, Freya, Rikku, Auron, Laguna, and Zell";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:41 PM;Rikku would be cool;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:41 PM;For 7 haha I want barret Lmao;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:41 PM;Barret!!;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:43 PM;6 hmmm;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:43 PM;Sabin or Shadow;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:43 PM;Celes is too much like Terra;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:43 PM;Though I wouldn't mind a similar fighting char;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:44 PM;Speaking of which;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:44 PM;Some people wanted Zack but he’ll be similar to Cloud;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:45 PM;He would be too much like cloud;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:45 PM;What I would like is a alternate costume;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:45 PM;Over chars who have similar others from their respective game;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:45 PM;Give them their look and voice etc;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:45 PM;Would be prob easier than adding a near clone as a new comer;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:46 PM;^^^^;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:46 PM;People could have Zack and Celes in;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:47 PM;Yeah but as alternative costumes;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:47 PM;Yep;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:48 PM;I would play Zack all day if he got in like that;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:48 PM;I dont really care for Zack tbh;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:48 PM;Hes not for everyone;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:49 PM;Omg his theme 😍;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;Wish it would play in more areas when he's not presented;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;I also love Julia’s theme;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;So cute 💕;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;I love her song too;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;It was made for the ending;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;Eyes on Me is the best song in FF;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:50 PM;Which was amazing;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:51 PM;GREATEST ATTACK EVER;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:51 PM;xD;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:51 PM;Laguna the greatest;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:52 PM;He’s the best character in VIII;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:52 PM;Agreed;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:52 PM;I love Zell too;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:52 PM;He’s funny;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:52 PM;The man with the **leg cramps**;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:52 PM;xD;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:53 PM;Zell is funny and hotheaded;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:53 PM;Reminds me of Sabin;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:53 PM;And what's funny is their both monks;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:53 PM;Sabin 💕;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:53 PM;Whenever I think of hotdogs I think of Zell;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:53 PM;Because he loves hotdogs;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 10:54 PM;"Prishe, Zell, and Sabin are my fave monks";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:57 PM;Same;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:57 PM;Monks are my favorite class;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:57 PM;Its why in 11 I started as one;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:58 PM;In 11 you can get trust npcs;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:58 PM;Which basically allows you to use Prishe;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:58 PM;I use her on my team with her best friend ulmia and tenzen;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:59 PM;Need to beat chains of promithia to unlock both;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;23-Jul-18 10:59 PM;Which is worth;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;23-Jul-18 11:06 PM;"Nice!, My fave class is black mage";;

ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 04:50 PM;"Is it possible to breed a second chocobo from your first, to get better stats that can compete with Chocobo Joe's black?";;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:07 PM;Yeah its easier when you find a more rare chocobo first then breed two good rarities to breed a water/land choco then breed those two to get black choco then breed black with best regular choco for golden choco. Note you must race the chocos to gain a higher rank to breed upwards;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:08 PM;I left out that I already had the gold.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:08 PM;But its a gold that still doesn't have remotely the same insane stats that Joe has;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:08 PM;Once you have the choco you want feed it greens;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:08 PM;I've maxed her out.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:08 PM;She caps out at 999 stamina and 1360 speed.;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:09 PM;Theres a secret to racing. Hold all the shoulder buttons to regenerate stamina;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:09 PM;I'm aware.;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:10 PM;Then im suprised your still losin;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:10 PM;"The problem is Joe has an equal amount of basically infinite stamina, and a higher Kpr.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:10 PM;I've only ever beaten him once.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:10 PM;If I'm not mistaken Joe was designed to be impossible to be beaten;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:10 PM;Not true;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;His stats are designed intentionally to be higher yes but not unbeatable;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;huh;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;"Well to be fair, I never really truly bothered with Chocobo Breeding";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;Welp I'm having no luck;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;too much RNG for my tastes;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;Its not that bad when soft reset exists;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;Still annoying;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:11 PM;but that's just me;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:12 PM;Imagine if you had to hit the power button instead;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:12 PM;Now THAT would be tedious.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:12 PM;Its what I have to do since I play the steam version.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:12 PM;aaaand I lost again.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:13 PM;I hate this asshole;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:13 PM;Do you use Manual?;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:13 PM;Yes.;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:13 PM;That was my last guess as to why your losin;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:14 PM;Wait Steam has no soft reset?;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:14 PM;Nope;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:14 PM;Eck;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:14 PM;"Agaib, Teioh's speed just outclasses everyone.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:14 PM;He can automatically take the lead whenever he wants.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:15 PM;....Okay everyone in S rank outclasses my gold.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:16 PM;It should have soft reste;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:16 PM;But they don't have as aggressive AI;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:16 PM;reset*;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jul-18 06:16 PM;like Ctrl+R should do the trick;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:16 PM;"But anywho yeah, that's why I was hoping I could breed my gold with another chocobo with better natural apptitude.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:18 PM;I DID IT! x_X;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:18 PM;Just have to be friggen aggressive early on!;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:18 PM;Well if anything youd wanna max out a black and a wonderful regular for best gold;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:19 PM;I already maxed them out.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:19 PM;So basically this is as high as I can go I guess.;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:20 PM;Not necessarilly but its too late now to go into the details;;
Baguette Cat#6233;24-Jul-18 06:31 PM;"I don't know if they changed that in the PC or steam rerelease, but I always just gave Gysahl greens until they couldn't eat more, raced, bred them, and I could beat Joe with a black chocobo";;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Jul-18 06:33 PM;No they didnt all greens give a certain amount of points to the stats Sylkis being the most effective;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:41 PM;I think I just had bad luck;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Jul-18 06:42 PM;"I'm gonna try experimenting with trying to produce a second gold, and breeding that with my first, and getting a gold with better speed.";;

pokemongenius#1474;25-Jul-18 06:13 PM;Checkpoints like that wouldnt exist until much later;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;25-Jul-18 06:40 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 final fantasy 7 is before the age of autosaving, so make sure to save often.";;

Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:13 PM;How do I influence summons in ff xv;;
Leon#9542;26-Jul-18 12:14 PM;"The summon you get is affected by the location you're in. If you're close to water, you'll likely get Leviathan. If you're in a big open rocky area, you'll probably get Titan. I don't remember the conditions for the others.";;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:15 PM;I’m in a dungeom;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:15 PM;I keep getting ramuh;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:15 PM;I haven’t even seen the others haha;;
Leon#9542;26-Jul-18 12:17 PM;"Yeah, he's the most common because his summon condition is time-based, so he'll just show up if you're taking too long. I think he might be the only one you can get in dungeons too, but I'm not 100% sure.";;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:19 PM;I’m in a dungeon severely under leveled Haha if it’s time based I may as well wait for the summon haha;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 12:19 PM;"Yep, Ramuh shows up in the open, and dungeons";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 12:19 PM;No other is like that;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:19 PM;I mean I was doing fine till they pulled three giants and a snake at once;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 12:20 PM;Are you at the Costlemark Tower?;;

Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:21 PM;Probably my least favourite dungeon;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 12:21 PM;"Three Red Giants, and a Snake did it";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 12:21 PM;"Yeah, the recommended level there is 55";;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:22 PM;It’s just so manageable until then;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 12:22 PM;And by that point you’re stuck;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 11:40 PM;How tf do you get to the boss of costlmark tower;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 11:43 PM;"That, I'm still trying to figure out myself. From what I can tell, it's random, depending on which of those stone lifts you take.";;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 11:45 PM;But like I did all of them;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 11:45 PM;Then I realised you can do them twice;;
Andrewj-5991#5009;26-Jul-18 11:45 PM;And I flipped the table;;

I decided to go back to Junon at this point because I wanted to get Aeris’s upgraded limit break, but when I actually arrived and had to exit the cargo ship, I couldn’t find out how to exit.

pink materia 🌸#2145;29-Jul-18 06:37 PM;FFIX is so good. You’ll love it @Santa Filthy Casual#9506;;
Pinecone#6148;29-Jul-18 10:32 PM;"9 is very simple but effective, it closely resembles ff6 more than ff7 if you ask me., This is because in ff9, you learn abilities through your equipment which is very similar to learning magic through espers in ff6. Each piece of equipment has abilities and you master those abilities by gaining enough AP. Once you have enough AP you can use that ability without having that piece of equipment equiped. This means that equipment is very important to the strategy in ff9, something that was pretty much lacking in ff8., So yeah, that's the basic gist of ff9's system  @Santa Filthy Casual#9506";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Jul-18 10:34 PM;"Oh, and abilities growth stack, so if you have two equipment that teach, let's say, mug equipped on a person, the AP will stack for said ability.";;
Pinecone#6148;29-Jul-18 10:36 PM;What he said;;
Pinecone#6148;29-Jul-18 10:40 PM;"You can't equip every ability at the same time tho, in order to equip any ability you need enough magic stones. Basically, every character has a max number of magic stones that can increase as you level up, and you can select as many abilities as you want as long as you have enough stones. Every ability also has varying amounts of stones required, so the level up ability needs 7 stones while the bug killer ability needs 2 stones";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Jul-18 10:41 PM;"So, it's best to keep old equipment, in general, and to master abilities.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Jul-18 10:41 PM;You won't be hindered really.;;
Pinecone#6148;29-Jul-18 10:42 PM;You can also synthesize equipment and weapons to make new equipment;;
Pinecone#6148;29-Jul-18 10:42 PM;You should always be cautious before doing that because you could ruin the chances of keeping an important elemental armor or missing out on an ability;;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;30-Jul-18 11:37 AM;I wanted ff4 psp graphics for ff6;;
Leon#9542;30-Jul-18 11:41 AM;"well the version of VI that you can get on PSP is actually just the PS1 version, it unfortunately didn't get any kind of enhanced port like IV did";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Jul-18 12:51 PM;It looks and plays great on Vita. Highly recommended.;;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;31-Jul-18 08:19 AM;For switch is what's rumored;;
Malfred#1000;31-Jul-18 08:55 AM;There was that Japan exclusive iOS FFTA: R or something to that effect;;
Malfred#1000;31-Jul-18 08:55 AM;Although I honestly don't know if that ever released;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 12:55 PM;"@HawkHD21#7305 I want a new FF Tactics game.  Hasn't been a new one in 11 years.  I love the original Tactics on the PS1.  One of the best FF games, imho.";;

pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 01:08 PM;I have the Ps1 Trilogy 10 HD 12 13 and 13-2 thats it;;

Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 01:56 PM;"I unofficially have Final Fantasy V.  I think the original Super Famicom is the best version of the game, but for the ones that were officially released in the US, FFV on the GBA is the best version.  I do not like the PS1 translation job of FFV.";;
pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 01:58 PM;Thats not the only problem with ps1 ffv;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 02:00 PM;"@pokemongenius#1474 I agree. I have other issues with the PS1 version, but I personally think it is a poor translation job done by Square is among the worst things I don't like about the port. I also do not like the loading times. They fixed a lot of the writing in the GBA port.";;
pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 02:02 PM;Well its more theres a save bug in the ps1 port too;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 02:25 PM;That's true.;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 02:25 PM;I think Final Fantasy IV on the PS1 had a similar save bug.;;
pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 02:31 PM;I wouldnt know but its worth avoiding regardless;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 02:32 PM;yeah the translation of V is kinda goofy;;

Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 02:36 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 As a Final Fantasy VI fan, I feel a lot of fans that pick FFVI as their favorite just crap on Final Fantasy VII, and I don't necessarily agree with that. I think Final Fantasy VII is an excellent game, and I love Cloud. Cloud always came across to me as this Han Solo -esque character and I just loved it.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 02:37 PM;yeah i dont get why people trash VII so much. it's such a great game.;;

pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 03:03 PM;It was a game that got over saturated from its praise it just made ppl not like it and see why it was loved;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:04 PM;there's also a remake coming up;;
pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 03:06 PM;I think the whole world knew that;;

pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 03:07 PM;Much like Twilight Princess the fan base popped off like crazy when FF7 got announced;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:07 PM;some people have mixed reactions about it tho;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;"My favorite ff is tactics, I know I'm alone in thinking that but it's the only one that I can hop right into and simultaneously be engrossed in it";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;Tactics is amazing;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;But I also don't understand why people like to trash 7 and 6 so much;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;i dont understand either;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;It's like you have to be on one side and hate the other game;;
pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;Well it was changing it to FF15 stuff but supposedly the whole game got restarted since then so dunno whats happenin now;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;I prefer 7 but I still love 6;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:08 PM;same;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:09 PM;im just upset that the remake is episodic;;

pokemongenius#1474;31-Jul-18 03:09 PM;That might not be true anymore cuzz of the restart. *inb4 im wrong*;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:10 PM;ehh i dunno;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:10 PM;i dont have high hopes;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:24 PM;"@Pinecone#6148 I will withhold judgment of Final Fantasy VII Remake until I have it in my hands and I play it. I'm not super optimistic due to how SE has handled the series in the past 10 years or so, but I will withhold my judgment until it comes out.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:26 PM;i agree;;

Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:27 PM;"Is it close minded? Yes, but I already gave SE too many second chances";;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:28 PM;"If they blow me away with the game, that's fine, but it looks like a cashgrab, I mean, why else would they release trailers for the game so early?";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:28 PM;they totally blew 15;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:28 PM;I think the talent of SE is there. It's the top management and overall direction of the company that I think is the reason they have lost my trust.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:28 PM;"since Sakaguchi left, things have gone to shambles";;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:28 PM;"Also, and this is just my opinion, but I think Nomura is a terrible director";;

pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;i dont think Nomura will do a good job directing the remake;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;I don't think he's capable of directing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;I blame the complete lack of organization and planning in every project;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;yup;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;@pink materia 🌸#2145 I felt with Final Fantasy XV that they had too many ideas flown into the game and just couldn't let go of some of them. So it became this giant mess of a game.;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;Yeah;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:29 PM;plus they announced the remake too early;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:30 PM;im sad they changed the story @Perrydice#9311;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:30 PM;"Exactly, there is no planning in the remake, they're just discussing on how to make the most money";;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:30 PM;They should have announced the remake of FF7 late into the development.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:30 PM;like making it episodic;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:30 PM;Even Nomura had to apologize for announcing the remake so early;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:31 PM;"Now, all the hype they created with FF7R is gone and they missed the boat. There are so many fans of FF7 that are just not looking forward to the remake.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:31 PM;it's that bad;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:31 PM;im one of them. @Perrydice#9311;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:31 PM;it's gonna suck so bad;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:31 PM;"Look at Bethesda, they release these huge anticipated games and they only market it late into development";;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:31 PM;Which I think only gets people more hyped;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:36 PM;i waited like 10 years for 15;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:36 PM;Fair enough. My first FF game was the original Final Fantasy II on the SNES (known now as Final Fantasy IV). Played it when I was 5. Then I played Final Fantasy on the original NES and loved it.;;

Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:37 PM;The original SNES version is god awful;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:38 PM;i have the PS1 version for V and VI;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:38 PM;@Pinecone#6148 They use the fake out trope so much in the game that I personally think the game suffers story wise. But I love the gameplay and the Active Time Battle was revolutionary at the time.;;

Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:41 PM;"The DS version of Final Fantasy IV is fantastic.

Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:41 PM;"But that's a good thing, squeals should improve over their predecessors";;

pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:42 PM;theres also voice acting;;

Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:44 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 I think the sequel is a repeat of the original.

Total babe.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:45 PM;ahh;;

Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:51 PM;"There is no customization in ff8, there's just an illusion of customization";;

Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:53 PM;Tactics was my 6th I think and it's still my favorite lol;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:54 PM;"i started out with 7, 10, 9, tactics, 8, 5 and then 6";;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:56 PM;"Honestly, for how stupid the story is, my personal opinion on which game to start with (for beginners) is Final Fantasy IV.  My reasons is it's easy, teaches you the active battle system (which is used in several of the FF games), has a story that you can follow (even though the story is kinda dumb, imho), and Cecil is a very likable character throughout the game.";;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 03:56 PM;But technically you can start with any of them.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:56 PM;i can agree with that;;
Pinecone#6148;31-Jul-18 03:59 PM;"4 is a good start, but my problem is the stupid story. I personally believe 6 does all of those things but, as we all know, has a good plot and interesting characters";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 03:59 PM;personally i think 6 is a nice start;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 04:00 PM;"6 would have been the next game I would have went to after 4, but in all honesty, you really could start with any of them.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 04:01 PM;"i started out with 7, so the ATB was easy to understand";;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 04:02 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 Most people probably started with Final Fantasy VII. It is an amazing game and at the time, it completely revolutionized so many things like cutscenes.  Also, the weapon, armor, accessory was streamlined, so it was easy for beginners to understand.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 04:03 PM;yup!;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 04:03 PM;plus the materia system is basic!;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;31-Jul-18 04:04 PM;and it revolutionized JRPGs;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 04:04 PM;It did. It put JRPGs on the map.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:14 PM;all of the games(the good ones) are fairly straightforward and solid;;
Marcello#4574;31-Jul-18 04:14 PM;FF is certainly a lot more accessible than other JRPGs like Persona;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:15 PM;literally that's what FF is;;
Marcello#4574;31-Jul-18 04:15 PM;No problem with that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:15 PM;also Persona is also extremely accessible;;

Marcello#4574;31-Jul-18 04:17 PM;It might feel overwhelming for someone who's playing for the first time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:17 PM;"especially 4 and 5, they make it so easy for people";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:17 PM;"maybe 1 and P2 Duology, but certainly not the last few main games";;

Marcello#4574;31-Jul-18 04:18 PM;That's the difference tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:18 PM;well yeah FF is easy;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:19 PM;anyone can play them;;
Marcello#4574;31-Jul-18 04:19 PM;I'd say Persona is just a bit harder to get into;;
Marcello#4574;31-Jul-18 04:19 PM;...and this is coming for someone who only played 5;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:19 PM;nah it's just different because they wanted a VN mixed with the usual jrpg tropes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:19 PM;this is coming from someone who played them all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:19 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 04:20 PM;There are some FF games that I think do not require a brain where you can move on by rapidly pushing the A or cross button.  Some do unless you overgrind.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:21 PM;yeah XIII doesn't require any brain activity;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:21 PM;might as well be watching a movie of the game;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 04:21 PM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 I agree FFXIII is like that.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:21 PM;same with XV except XV would be a movie that has not been finished;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:22 PM;with tons of filler to make it seem like there's something there when there isn't;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Jul-18 04:23 PM;"I think the original NA SNES version of Final Fantasy IV is like that as well, which is why I prefer the DS version because it is way harder.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:23 PM;the DS version sucks;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:23 PM;I don't know why they thought augments would be a cool addition to the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:24 PM;"especially when the idea of it is just lame overall and then they give early enemies more HP to make the game seem harder, when in reality it is just adjustment of numbers";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;31-Jul-18 04:24 PM;then the cheesy voice acting that no one asked for and ugly visuals rolled into one game;;

Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 11:33 AM;"They've said on numerous occasions that they'll have FF, their flagship franchise, aimed at the future - especially the numbered entries.";;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 11:33 AM;"And said future apparently doesn't include turn-based combat, although they might still be interested in doing something with the job system.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Aug-18 11:40 AM;"To be fair, they have been moving away from the turn based system for years";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Aug-18 11:41 AM;X-2 is the first obvious example of the action RPG route they wanted to go down;;
Perrydice#9311;02-Aug-18 12:11 PM;We'll see. I just hope they focus on making great games but I think it does show that the turn based RPG fanbase is still alive and people are still wanting to buy them.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:33 PM;it's not dead but uh it isn't hype enough to make them a lot of money;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;02-Aug-18 12:34 PM;Squeenix has stated that they want Final Fantasy to go into a more multiplayer online state;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:34 PM;especially since they tried with Setsuna and that sequel to Setsuna and both were hot garbage;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:34 PM;having one game or even two games (WoFF from 2016) in recent years doesn't change things;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:35 PM;these games definitely did not outsell or even come close to others that are on much larger scales;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:35 PM;they'll likely save turn based and more older styled games for low budget titles;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:35 PM;where it doesn't matter if it flops or not since they didn't invest all that much into the games anyway;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:36 PM;Well imo I think from their perspective they see their games like I Am Setsuna and World of Final Fantasy do alright or even badly;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:37 PM;"And that isn't really saying good things about the prospect of a turn based FF, especially because FF is one of their premier titles";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:38 PM;one of the main reasons they won't focus on older styled games anymore is because they can't appeal to a wide audience anymore;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Aug-18 12:38 PM;Much easier to sell a game like XV for example;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:51 PM;"Yeah, after shit hits the fan in the middle of the game, you're basically told to explore everywhere until you find people.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:51 PM;Agreed.;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;03-Aug-18 04:39 AM;I still recognize it as a bad game.;;
Rasea#1840;03-Aug-18 04:39 AM;"That being said, I don't think that FFII's system is bad. It's *different* and FF fans (no offense to anyone) don't like that very much.

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 04:59 AM;Auto-Haste lasts only for the beginning of the fight and only 30 seconds;;

Rasea#1840;03-Aug-18 04:59 AM;And I always used Fang over Snow because female bias and Fang actually deals damage and has that aforementioned utility;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:00 AM;Snow is a better offensive character than Fang;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:00 AM;"Faster animations, higher offensive stats at that point, access to a good RAV selection without immense investment";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:00 AM;And is the better SEN;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:01 AM;"Sazh is King of the Hill starting with Chapter 11, and ending sometimes between the end of Chapter 11 and the end of Chapter 13, depending on how much your characters are developed";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:11 AM;Yeah it's a good team starting from Chapter 12 (with good development);;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:11 AM;"The relative quality of characters depends almost entirely on the level of development of the team, and just a bit on the part of the game you're in";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:00 PM;"Yeah, it's easy to break";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:01 PM;"If 8 was to be remade, the whole system would need a massive re-balancing";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:32 PM;Not sure how to break it yet...;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:33 PM;I wouldn't worry about breaking the game on your first playthrough;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:36 PM;What’s an example of how to break it? Out of curiosity.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:37 PM;I’m still trying to work out the mechanics.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:39 PM;"Get Siren, have her learn Life-Refine Magic. Get 30 tents. Refine 30 tents into 300 Curagas. Junction 100 Curagas to HP-J to get your HP up to like 3,000-4,000. You can do all of this within the first few hours of the game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:41 PM;Ha. I see.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:42 PM;How do you refine?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:46 PM;"Basically, you get a summon, or Guardian Force (GF for short), you have them learn an ability (like Mug), Junction Slot (like HP-J), or GF Ability (like Life-Mag Ref). You equip a GF on a character, and you get AP, for the ability the GF is learning. Once you'll have GF Abilities, you'll see a new thingy in the menu, called something like GF Abilities (I'll have to double check on the name when I get home). You'll go to it, see Refine, and it'll bring you to the Items, and the items you can refine will be in white, and the incompatible ones will be greyed out. So, you'll select tents (pick 30), and the game will tell you what magic, and how much, you'll be getting.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:46 PM;The ratio differs with the items to spells;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:47 PM;Not everything will be 1:10;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:47 PM;"Some items, you'll need 100 of the item just for *one* spell";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:48 PM;"You don't have MP in 8. You basically consume magic, like they're items.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:48 PM;"So, if you have 100 Curagas, and use one, you'll now have 99";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:48 PM;100 being max;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:49 PM;Ok. That makes some sense.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:50 PM;"It'll make more sense when you start, and get a lil bit into the game";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:50 PM;So there are different refine abilities? Life magic being one?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:50 PM;Yes;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:51 PM;"You can get Fire, Ice, Time, Light, and a few others";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:51 PM;So I equip a GF to a char... that GF can learn abilities that I choose via AP when I win battles.;;
Trickster#9840;03-Aug-18 03:51 PM;Yes;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:52 PM;And I can then use those abilities but only when that gf is junctioned to a character.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:52 PM;Not quiet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:52 PM;And so then junctioning magic is a second layer on top of that?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:52 PM;"You won't get, abilities until you master them";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:53 PM;"And when you have them mastered, you don't need the GF equipped";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 03:53 PM;Ok. So it gets learned by the gf and then mastered by the character;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:54 PM;hold up;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:57 PM;"So, you get Ifrit. You go to the GF menu. You select HP-J for Ifrit to learn. Then you equip Ifrit to Squall. You do battles. You get AP. HP-J requires 30 AP. Once you get 30 AP, Ifrit mastered HP-J. As long as you keep Ifrit equipped on Squall, you can junction magic to HP-J to get a boost in HP. If you have Ifrit learn, let's say, Mug (BTW, he doesn't have Mug, I'm just using it as an example). Mug will require 100 AP. Once you have mastered Mug, you can equip Mug *without* having Ifrit equipped on Squall.";;
Trickster#9840;03-Aug-18 03:58 PM;No;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:58 PM;"If Ifrit has 87/100 AP for Mug, and he's equipped to Squall, and you unequip him, and give him to Zell, he'll still have that 87/100 AP.";;
Trickster#9840;03-Aug-18 03:58 PM;You'd still need ifrit equipped on squall to use mug.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:59 PM;"Okay, I might be mistaken on that";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:59 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 03:59 PM;my bad;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:00 PM;"So once they’re learned, they are learned and I can trade them between my other chars?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:00 PM;Yes;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:00 PM;"so, you don't need to keep on relearning Mug";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:00 PM;Ok.;;
Trickster#9840;03-Aug-18 04:00 PM;Unless you unlearn it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:01 PM;Now junctioning magic is a second layer on top of that? Looks like different gfs allow you to junction different spells to different stats?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:02 PM;And junctioning different magic to different stats gives some uptick to those stats based on the combination?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:04 PM;"To junction magic, you need at least one GF equipped, on a specific character. So if you equip Ifrit to Squall, Squall can junction magic, but no one else can, unless they have at least one GF equipped. If Ifrit has learned HP-J, and is equipped to Squall, you can go to the Junction menu, select Squall, and junction magic to HP.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:04 PM;The boost you get depends on the spell you use;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:04 PM;"Some spells (like Cure) are better for HP, than others.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:07 PM;So I’m on the right track.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:07 PM;More spells you have means more effect when you junction that magic?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:07 PM;Yep;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:10 PM;"There's a number of ways you can get magic. You can draw them from enemies/bosses. (Draw is an ability you set up, when you equip a GF. All GF's have Draw already mastered, along with a few other abilities). You can find Draw Points around the world (including hidden ones in the Overworld/World Map). Or, you can get Triple Triad cards (a fun TCC mini game that *really* needs to make it to the real world), and mod said cards into items to refine.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:11 PM;"Yeah. I’ve found two draw points so far, both in balamb gardens";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:12 PM;"Oh, you've already started the game. I thought you were still doing some research before starting.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:12 PM;"Don't forget to draw from bosses, some have GFs for you to get.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:14 PM;"If you really truly want to break the game, and make it your bitch, I highly recommend watching HCBailly's LP of the game.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:14 PM;He taught me shit about the series I never knew about;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:21 PM;"Oh! Before I forget, there's really no gear/equipment in 8, besides the weapons. Not only that, but you'll have to craft the weapons. You'll find Monthly Weapon magazines that show you the weapons you can craft, and the items required. These magazines aren't *required* to craft, just the items. You'll need to go to a Junk Shop to upgrade the weapons.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:21 PM;"The only one worth upgrading is Squall's, as his limit breaks are attached to his weapons.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Aug-18 04:22 PM;"The stat boosts you get with the new weapons are minimal, compared to proper junctioning.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:23 PM;Haha. I barely started;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;03-Aug-18 04:24 PM;oh you finished VII? Nice!;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;03-Aug-18 04:24 PM;Yup. Last night;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;03-Aug-18 04:25 PM;what do you think of the junction system?;;

Perrydice#9311;03-Aug-18 04:42 PM;"@Psychotic Ninja#0661 I would start by eliminating the level scaling. That is one of the biggest problems with why the junctioning system didn't work, imho. I do think that the junctioning system is a great idea but I didn't like how it was executed and I think eliminating the level scaling to Squall would make it work better.";;

HotChocolate#7254;03-Aug-18 06:47 PM;"I have been having a tough time beating the Red Dragon in the TotA (ff7), mostly because I don't have the fire ring and big guard. I know if I keep on grinding I will eventually beat it, but i'm scared that after I beat it, and I have to fight the demons gate boss , i'm going to be bulldozed. Everyone says there is a huge strength difference between the two, and if I cant even beat the red dragon,  beating demons gate is going to be impossible! Any advice on what I should do? I listed my team below., , **Aeris - Level 29 with a Silver Armlet, Peace Ring and a Wizer Staff (never used her before this), Cloud - Level 33 with a Gold Armlet, White Cape and a Murasame, Vincent - Level 32 with an Edincoat, Power Wrist and a Silver Rifle**";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:19 PM;Or is it stat related?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:20 PM;Luck?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Aug-18 02:21 PM;"Alright, so, when you draw from a boss, or enemy you will draw somewhere between 0 and 9 of that Magic. (Zero being you missed). If you draw a GF from a boss *You are guaranteed the GF*. The higher your Magic Stat, through Mag-J or leveling, *the greater chances of you getting 9 Magic*. In other words, if you want to draw the Life Spell, and you have a high Mag stat, every time you draw, you'll be getting like 7-9 Life. If you have a lower Mag stat, you'll be getting some 1-3, or Misses.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:21 PM;"Wait, so your magic stat determines success of a good draw?";;
pokemongenius#1474;04-Aug-18 02:22 PM;I dont think thats true;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:23 PM;And should I be drawing at the start of any fight? Do I draw multiple times a fight with multiple characters?;;
pokemongenius#1474;04-Aug-18 02:24 PM;Id recommend drawing at the beginning just to get started. You can use GF Refine Abilities to quickly gain magic more effeciently from items;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:38 PM;So draw once and that’s it? Or start out and then just have one person attack and one draw?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:39 PM;"Also, no reason not to equip every Gf to someone or no?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:40 PM;That came out confusing. What I meant was: should I equip a Gf as soon as I get it? Or is there a situation when I shouldn’t?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:41 PM;"Also, when I draw from a boss to get a GF, is that guaranteed success ?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:41 PM;Or might I have to draw multiple times?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Aug-18 02:52 PM;"`I dont think thats true`, , Actually it's true.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 02:53 PM;Ok. I’m starting to get it. Haven’t even had a single fight yet. Ha.;;
Trickster#9840;04-Aug-18 02:55 PM;It is true.;;
Trickster#9840;04-Aug-18 02:56 PM;Having a higher mag stat increases your chances of getting higher numbered draws.;;
Trickster#9840;04-Aug-18 02:56 PM;Also you have 100% chance of drawing a GF from a boss if they have one.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Aug-18 02:57 PM;"How much you want to draw, and when you draw is up to you. My advice is don't draw from every enemy encounter. Don't draw 100 of everything. You don't have enough inventory space. There's an optional boss (who becomes a GF). He has the Life spell. My recommendation is to have your main three keep on drawing from the boss, until each have 100 Lives. (You'll know, when the game tells you can't stock anymore when you try to draw again). So, you'll draw once, and get 9 Lives. So, best case scenario, you'll only have to draw 10 times.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Aug-18 03:39 PM;"Lives meaning a life spell, yes?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Aug-18 03:39 PM;Yes;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Aug-18 03:58 PM;"Here's a (incomplete) list of spells I consider to be important: Cure, Cura, Curaga, Life, Full-Life, Triple (Basically allows you to use three spells in one turn.

VOLTAG3#1137;05-Aug-18 01:38 PM;Still not sure if I should forsake dignity and switch to wait though...;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Aug-18 01:38 PM;Then may I recommend grinding;;
VOLTAG3#1137;05-Aug-18 01:41 PM;"I've heard this game's 50 hours on main story alone, I'd rather not make it longer than it already is. Besides, I've heard down the grapevine Sephiroth gets super hard when you start going above level 50, so I'm trying to space out my levelling.";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Aug-18 01:41 PM;Thats not true has to be 99;;
VOLTAG3#1137;05-Aug-18 01:42 PM;Wait what?;;

VOLTAG3#1137;05-Aug-18 01:45 PM;Weird... Then why was my friend saying it was? I know he's not the kinda guy who'd say something like that to screw me over. Weird...;;
VOLTAG3#1137;05-Aug-18 01:46 PM;"Maybe he was just fed false information or something and then gave it to me, I dunno.";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Aug-18 01:48 PM;Probably given false info. Its fine it happens;;
Deleted User#0000;05-Aug-18 01:49 PM;@Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440 thank you;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Aug-18 01:49 PM;Its easy for someone to misremember or mishear;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:21 PM;but you do you;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 04:22 PM;Yuffie takes like a minute to get though.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 04:23 PM;I didn’t really use her but I got her regardless.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:23 PM;and her Level 3-2 Limit is the best;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:23 PM;Or one of the best;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 04:24 PM;Not as good as Cait Sith;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:25 PM;"Cait Sith's only good if you cheat, or RNGesus is on your side";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 04:25 PM;He can cause death;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 04:25 PM;100% death;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:25 PM;and you gotta be lucky to get it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:26 PM;Both Omnislash and Doom of the Living hit 15 times;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:26 PM;Both Angermax and Highwind hit 18 times;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 04:26 PM;These are the 4 best (offensive) limit breaks;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 04:58 PM;"Still not sure about Cait Sith, Ive been sticking to Cloud, Aeris, Barret combo for most of the game so far.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:06 PM;My final party was cloud Tifa and cid;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:13 PM;Not sure about Cid either for that matter. Hate Tifa though.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:20 PM;Haha. Yeah. I put Tifa in for story reasons.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:21 PM;And cid was guaranteed as soon as I saw him with a cigar in his mouth ala Hannibal from the A-Team.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:22 PM;"Cid is cool story wise, i just dunno if hes good gameplay wise. I gotta pick one of the others carefully later on. For reasons Im not allowed to discuss in tgis channel.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:24 PM;"Ha. I hear you. I’ll go ahead and say pick whichever ones you like best. It’s all about materia anyway. Outside of emerald and ruby, I found the game pretty easy.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:24 PM;Big guard trivializes most things if you get that.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:25 PM;I just give my characters all the materia i have available. Barret holds onto summons and the rest is divided between the otherd;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:26 PM;Later in the game you’ll want to use the least amount of materia you can while still being effective.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:26 PM;"But for now, equip as much as possible to level it up.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:26 PM;I dont like to worry about how it affects my stats if thats what youre talking abouy;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:27 PM;It is what I’m talking about. And that’s totally up to you. Just my two cents.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:28 PM;Sounds like you’re still on disc 1?;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:29 PM;"Im on PS4, 15 hours in";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:29 PM;But still disc one? I think even PS4 tells you when to “change the disc”... virtually.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:30 PM;Could be wrong. I played on Vita and that’s what it did for me.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:30 PM;"Its digital tho, how would that work?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:31 PM;Ha on Vita it brings up a screen that says “please put in disc 2” and you actually have to go into settings and change the disc to disc 2.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:31 PM;"It’s odd for sure, but that’s what it said.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:32 PM;"Thats kinda neat, hope they kept it in this version.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:32 PM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661  can you confirm for PS4 version?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:32 PM;I’m curious now.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:33 PM;I’d assume it’s the same because it’s basically the same port with resolution output differences I believe.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 05:33 PM;what what?;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:33 PM;PS4 just says End of part 1 I think;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:33 PM;Same for PC;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:33 PM;Oh interesting.;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:33 PM;Fun fact;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:34 PM;If you switch the disc while playing the game will keep playing till it breaks somewhere;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:34 PM;"Because the only difference between discs are the FMVs, but the entire game is on every disc";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:34 PM;Til what breaks?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:34 PM;So it’ll ref out at an FMV?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Aug-18 05:35 PM;"Yeah, PS4, and PC both will say end of Part 1";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:35 PM;Till it crashes if it tries to load a FMV;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:35 PM;"Then what's the point of having 3 discs, fmvs arent exactly long or big in size";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:36 PM;Ha. There are a lot of FMVs in disc 3 if I remember correctly.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:36 PM;But I’m really not sure.;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:36 PM;"They are pretty big. Considering you still have to put in textures and audio files, 700MB isn't enough";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:36 PM;Disc one was the longest and disc 3 was the shortest in terms of story missions.;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:36 PM;The final FMV in disc 3 occupies the most space in the disc;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:37 PM;Yeah I bet.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:37 PM;"Wow, 15 hours and im not even done with disc one part yet. This gone be long";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:37 PM;"Some people say it's a design choice, like split the game into parts but it's just a waste of money considering you have to burn two more discs and use a special case";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:38 PM;So it's only because of that technical limitation;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:38 PM;Yeah my playthrough clocked in at around 40 hours or so. I would say disc one is pretty close to half of the story of the game. Maybe a little less.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:38 PM;I actually like the idea of splitting the game into arcs. Maybe thats why theyre talking about making the remake episodoc;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:39 PM;"Nah, the episodic thing is just a money grab lmao";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:39 PM;It doesn't get more stupid than that tbh;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:39 PM;A remake of a 20+ years old game be episodic;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:40 PM;"If its gonna work like how telltale does it then im cool with it. if its full price per episode, then thats just bad practice";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:40 PM;They said full games;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:40 PM;So you can assume full price per episode;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:41 PM;"Well that sucks... But hell, i dont have a right to complain; i know im gonna buy it anyway";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:42 PM;"If that actually comes one day, it will probably be on the PS5, which I will wait like 3-5 years to get one.";;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:42 PM;"Well, the FF13 trilogy is episodic and they've mentioned fashioning FF7R after its concept. A full game in however many parts they want to do";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:43 PM;The difference is that these games are almost self contained;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:43 PM;I doubt the ps5 will come anytime soon;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:43 PM;Wasn't it already confirmed to be ps4?;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:44 PM;"We haven't had any news about it since 2015 when it was announced, hence the it will never come meme";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:45 PM;What about persona 6;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:45 PM;Im sure itll come eventually. squares finally pulling through on other games after a decade;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:46 PM;...the only good games from Square in many years were the ones not developed by Square lmao;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;Who made octopath?;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;I saw the ad for that game;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;"So XV, and the KH games weren't made by square?";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;What a beautiful game;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;Aside from the pixels;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;XV is... pretty subpar if you ask me.;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:47 PM;Enjoyable for a single run but that's it;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:48 PM;"As for KH, most titles after KH2 are pretty bad";;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:49 PM;XV is considered the worst in the series. And Octopath Traveler was made by Acquire. (And Squeenix but I'm pretty sure Squeenix just financed it for them to put their name on the project);;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:49 PM;I'm pretty sure II is considered the worst lol;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:49 PM;XV is amazing compared to II;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:49 PM;"Domt get me wrong i like turn based, hell 7s giving me a whole new appreciation for it. but i like xv's combat style more. And well, i liked bbs and dream drop. Cant speak for coded or 358. Also you're both wrong, i hear its mystic quest";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:50 PM;I'll give XV some credit because there are people who still enjoy it;;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:50 PM;"```Octopath Traveler is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch.```";;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:50 PM;^;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:50 PM;"XV's combat is pretty bland, I don't think there's anything redeemable about it...";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:50 PM;Who the fuck is Acquire;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:51 PM;"I still enjoyed BBS (and hated DDD), but it's very inferior to 2 tbh \:/";;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:51 PM;"Acquire Corp. (株式会社アクワイア Kabushikigaisha Akuwaia) is a video game developer based in Japan, mainly known for their Tenchu and Way of the Samurai series.";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:51 PM;Ah;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;06-Aug-18 05:51 PM;....never heard of em;;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:52 PM;"2 is still the best, ddd was ok. The only one I consider truly bad is chain.";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:52 PM;Fair enough.;;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:53 PM;I think it's reasonable for the spin-offs (though they're more side games) to not be up to par with the mainline KH titles. They're more meant to experiment with systems anyways;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:53 PM;"I don't think it's that reasonable, because instead of improving upon KH2 they decided to scrap everything that made it amazing.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:54 PM;"Yeah, but sometimes they experiment a bit too much. And by sometimes I mean every time. But I get it, since improving on kh2 is what 3 is for, not the spin offs";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:54 PM;"Well, the problem is...";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:54 PM;You **have** to play the side games if you don't want to be completely lost in KH3.;;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:55 PM;Or just watch a Youtube video giving you a synopsis on the side games if you don't want to buy several games & systems;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:55 PM;"Unless they do some good recaps in KH3, but it's too much to eat in such a short time.";;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:55 PM;Though the 1.5/2.5 exists which gives you most of it;;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:55 PM;"And 2.8, of course";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:55 PM;"Might i add, ive played all of them (very recently, and all in a big marathon row to catch up) and even then im confused";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:56 PM;I watched Re:CoM and DDD cutscenes because I couldn't stand playing these games;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:56 PM;DDD literally almost made me motion sick or whatever;;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:56 PM;"And I think it was worth it. KH3 gets the reaction commands from 2, freeflow combat from DDD, shotlocks from BBS and more new stuff culminating in an awesome game";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:57 PM;DDD was fine for me. Im a sucker for cute pets and such. Flowmotion can die in a ditch though.;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:57 PM;"I prefer limits and forms, which they scrapped for good after 2";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:57 PM;"BBS and DDD are pretty floaty, which is pretty sad because it makes challenge runs *not* fun";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:58 PM;Also wait are they not using drives for 3?;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:58 PM;"Also, 2 had an amazing critical difficulty. BBS on critical (or even) proud is a bit of a pain";;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:59 PM;DDD on both proud and critical are a plain awful;;
Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 05:59 PM;"I'm not sure, I haven't seen any of that in 3";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 05:59 PM;BBS even on Normal has terrible boss design. dream drop did a lot better with that. Until the last two bosses anyway.;;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 05:59 PM;"Drives are still there, in a different form";;
Rasea#1840;06-Aug-18 06:00 PM;"Drives exist through keyblades. Keyblades give you different playstyles, and you can switch them on the fly now. They have a base form and then an upgraded form which is obtained by completing the world you get it from";;

Marcello#4574;06-Aug-18 06:00 PM;"Oh, I see. That's... interesting.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;06-Aug-18 06:01 PM;The fact you know so much when its not even out yet scares me.;;

I don't like 13's OST except for maybe The Promise and maybe Serah's Theme (which is a vocal version of The Promise). I do not like Blinded by Light. To me, it sounds like nails on a chalkboard, and the problem with this song is that you hear this the most due to most of the game being running through hallways and battling. It's another reason why I dislike 13, but that's just my personal opinion.";;

Rasea#1840;09-Aug-18 05:45 AM;"As for the 4th phase, Juice, you'll want to use Light Slash to get up to him (since he's in the air and all that) and then use spells. Occasionally using Beat Down or Heavy Slash";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Aug-18 03:47 PM;Yes and no. You have characters that simulate Jobs. Like Aerith = White Mage. Yuffie = Ninja. Tifa = Monk/Black Belt. Etc. etc. You can distribute Materia between your party to further simulate said jobs. But they don't have true proper Jobs;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Aug-18 05:10 PM;"@DRFlyer#2215 They decided to design the characters a bit like in FF6, where each of them embodied a job/class with exclusive skills. Some skills or passives were linked to relics (accessories), and all characters could learn all spells through magicites";;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Aug-18 05:11 PM;FF7 does the same but through materias and limit breaks.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Aug-18 05:13 PM;"Each character embodies a job (or eventually 2) with their character-design (the weapons they use, especially), their base stats (but you could get special items to permanently boost your stats to even where they were lacking) and with their limit breaks.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;09-Aug-18 05:14 PM;"Things like the dragoon Jump is in some of Cid Highwind's limits, whereas the Ninja's Throw command was done with a materia";;
DRFlyer#2215;09-Aug-18 05:24 PM;Very interesting;;
DRFlyer#2215;09-Aug-18 05:24 PM;"because so far I've played 1, where you pick jobs at the start, 2, where you do whatever you want really lol, and 3 where you switch jobs as you go";;
DRFlyer#2215;09-Aug-18 05:24 PM;oh and also 11 and 14 but mmos don't really count;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Aug-18 05:28 PM;"4, 9, and 10 have pre-determined Jobs (Where you can branch out in 10) 10-2, 12, and 13 also have a Job system (well Zodiac Age version of 12, not vanilla version), but how they handle them is different per game. 5 Also has a job system, and like with 3, you can switch between them.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Aug-18 07:27 PM;I’d say 7 has no jobs. They are materia-based.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Aug-18 07:32 PM;Limit breaks are fine but they’re still a small portion of the game. I wouldn’t call them job-defining.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Aug-18 07:34 PM;I want to break VIII but I don’t think I’ll figure it out without a guide.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Aug-18 07:35 PM;But I get the system enough to probably stroll through the game.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Aug-18 08:45 PM;"Graphically, yes";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Aug-18 08:45 PM;"Gameplay, none";;
pokemongenius#1474;09-Aug-18 08:45 PM;Chrono Triggers gimmick is team based combat with a lil touch of active battling meaning sometimes you need to wait for openings. Stuff like that isnt in the mainline games afaik the Tales series RPGS is fairly close;;

VOLTAG3#1137;10-Aug-18 05:16 AM;"Wait, so I just realised after she does her Ultima move she's supposed to die in the process... But if Ultima kills everyone doing that move and you get a game over before she can die... Then you literally can't win! What the hell? Is there a trick I'm missing?";;
Rasea#1840;10-Aug-18 05:25 AM;"So admittedly, I've never played FF7 so I don't really know power levels or anything like that. That being said..., , According to this guide, she takes several turns to countdown to Ultima. So you're supposed to kill her before that. Which doesn't seem too hard. She's level 61, though, so I imagine buffing up your party a bit will help., , Absorb deals 2,000 magical damage, Slap deals 1,500 damage (can set Fury, used only when B is alive), Bio2 for 1,300 poison damage (can set Poison, used only if both arms are alive), Cure3 for 3,500 healing (used only when C is alive and B is dead), Stop (sets Stop, used only if B is alive and C is dead)., , She only casts Ultima once she hits 15,000 HP (starts with 60,000) and begins a turn countdown of five. You should be able to take her down before the countdown ends";;
VOLTAG3#1137;10-Aug-18 06:22 AM;"Thanks. I've found a knack to it now, take the tentacles first then aim for the centre. Still not beating the game though, Sephiroth 2 exists.";;
Rasea#1840;10-Aug-18 06:23 AM;"Yeah :p Was going to say that, according to several guides, that fight is pretty easy. And if you're having difficulty with it, you probably won't be able to take on the followup fights";;
VOLTAG3#1137;10-Aug-18 06:25 AM;"It's easier now that I know the pattern but I survived by only a shred of health. Then Sephiroth 1 was... Surprisingly tame, but now I've seen Sephiroth 2, yeah its not happening, i'll have to wait on the remake.";;

PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 09:57 AM;my question however with heavy spoilers ahead:;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:00 AM;"I have done the following already: PuPu, Obel Lake, all GF but Eden, all ultimate weapons, all skills GF's can learn inherently (the inherently useful ones), almost all cards in the game (the rest I can get from Left Diamond on disk 4, or I get throughout story into disk 4), got pretty much every single sidequest you can do up to this point done, and got everyone their best junctions (aside from Ultima). The only GF I didn't get yet is Odin, since I'm saving him for him being a better use then gilgamesh in disk 4";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:01 AM;Is there any reason I shouldn't fight Ultima Weapon and get Eden that way?;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:02 AM;I always fight Ultima Weapon.  It's a good source of Ultima spells and if you're doing a 100% run you should do it anyway.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:03 AM;Also Ultima Weapon I think is the hardest boss in the game.  Omega has higher stats but follows a set pattern and is predictable.;;

Also are magitek cores found in solheim ruins different from the demonic ones used by niflhiem? Also how exactly are MT programmed?, , Do we know how much of niflhiem military has living foot soldiers on the ground? I mean I know commanders like caligor and aranea use living troops but do we know? Also do the living soldiers get any kind of cybernetic enhancement? , , Is magitek power armor you get in game and that the imperial general wears in the kingsglaive movie left overs from solheim?

VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:02 AM;I don't quite follow what you're trying but I'll hear it out;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:06 AM;"Basically, I'm modifying one of my saves to mimic, your save, or at least get as close as I can, with the information you've provided me. Some of it might be outdated, but that's fine. I'mma see what I can do with this setup to further understand your situation, so that I can, in theory, better help you.";;

VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:13 AM;"Ohhh, ok, just gimme a sec I'll check up";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:15 AM;"They're very close, just some slight level and hp differences. Cloud is 3044, Cid is 4010, Barret is 2373";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:16 AM;But it should be close enough you've got a good idea;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:19 AM;But yeah *Reflect Ring is a bad idea*;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:21 AM;"Yeah, I was only using it because for some reason it mysteriously made Cid immune to L4 Death but I guess I'm far enough along I can switch out, I have a poison ring.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:22 AM;"Okay, so far, I started with Cross Slash, Dynamite Big Shot, and Bahamut Zero";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:22 AM;Cloud used Regen on himself;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:22 AM;He'll use it on Barret next;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:25 AM;Who are you fighting at the moment?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:25 AM;Jenova;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:26 AM;"Jenova right now for me is pretty easy now I know to get the arms first, I can get him down juuuuuust before the countdown's over but sometimes I'm not that lucky";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:27 AM;Your biggest issue is the low HP;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:29 AM;"Must be the Materia weighing me down. I have tried your setup, it did get more success, definitely, but I still failed in the end. You seem good at this so I'm not putting it down to bad setup there, maybe my strategy is just bad?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:29 AM;"Okay, I just defeated Jenova before the countdown finished";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:31 AM;"Basically spam limits, Cid w-item Hi-potions, Barret spammed summons (Bahamut family first, then Kajuta, then spammed Ramuh). When the countdown begain Cloud and Cid were attacking";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:33 AM;"Limits were dealing about 5,000-6,000 damage. Same with Bahamut family. Ramuh, Cid, and Cloud's physical were dealing 1,500 - 2,000 damage";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:33 AM;"I also used W-item X-potion on Cid, and Turbo Either on Barret";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:34 AM;Now onto Bizzaro;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:43 AM;"So far, same thing really. With this setup, there's not much to do but summon spam, and be prepared to heal every second";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:44 AM;"Bizarro I also found kinda easy, the trouble starts when Safer comes along...";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:48 AM;Bizarro down;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:51 AM;Your best hope with Reflect Ring is Safer uses Shadow Flare on Cid;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:54 AM;"Yeah, I plan to switch to poison ring when all is said and done here but tell me what else you notice if you do.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:56 AM;"If you have any, try to save all of your X-potions, Elixers, and MegaElixers for after he uses Super Nova";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 02:57 AM;Use Eithers and Turbo Eithers on Barret;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 02:58 AM;Duly noted.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:03 AM;Safer defeated;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:03 AM;killed himself with a reflected Shadow Flare;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 03:04 AM;"Wait what? Would you say its worth banking on that reflect, or should I just switch to poison ring anyway?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:09 AM;"So, to sum up, for all three: Use your Limits, stay fully healed, summon spam (recommended order: Bahamut Zero, Neo Bahamut, Bahamut x2,  Kujata, Ramuh), restore Barret's MP. When at Safer Sephiroth, when he flies up, he'll use Pale Horse (about 1,000-2,000 damage) and then follow up with Super Nova. **FULLY HEAL RIGHT AFTER SUPER NOVA**. This is the perfect time to use your Megaelixers, Elixers, and X-Potions., , If you do keep Reflect Ring on Cid, make sure he uses two hi-potions on himself. If Cloud, Barret, and Cid are fully healed, Cloud and Cid can attack.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:09 AM;Otherwise keep them on the ready for heals;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:09 AM;Limits take priority;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:10 AM;They literally take priority.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:10 AM;"As in, they'll go before any other action in game. If you need to heal, heal before using a limit";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:12 AM;"Funnily enough, Cid was the one who died the most, when I thought it would have been Barret.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 03:12 AM;"Yeah, I've noticed with my setup, enemies seem to really like going for Cid over the others";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:13 AM;"This is all I can say on the matter, at least for now";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:13 AM;Hopefully this helps;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 03:15 AM;"Alrighty, I'll give it another swing. I must be kinda pathetic to need all of this stuff, hope it doesn't drag me down in the community or anything.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:15 AM;heh;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:15 AM;"well at anyrate, I'm going to bed now";;

Thelitedragon#4507;12-Aug-18 03:16 AM;Don't worry mate;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Aug-18 03:16 AM;I still haven't finished VII;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:17 AM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 I can finish it for you, for a fee :P";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 03:18 AM;Also for the record I do think your pfp is pretty cool.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 03:20 AM;I still think the best part of that whole ordeal was Sephiroth killing himself;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 03:54 AM;"Still couldn't beat him. Bleh. If Cloud didn't get turned into a frog and become useless for the rest of the fight I might've won, but that happens every time.";;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Aug-18 06:11 AM;Ribbon doh;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 06:24 AM;I only have one;;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Aug-18 08:14 AM;Rip;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 11:36 AM;You can use Maiden's Kiss or Remedy's to cure Toad;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 11:46 AM;Do you have any accessories besides the ribbon that mitigate toad?;;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Aug-18 11:46 AM;Couldnt you Elemental + Heal for the same effect?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:12 PM;Can someone tell me a couple “hints” on breaking VIII?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:15 PM;30 tents + Life Ref Magic;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:16 PM;Turning tents into something...;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:16 PM;You'll need to draw a GF from a boss;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:16 PM;To get life ref ?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:17 PM;What can I do with these water spells I’m pulling off these beach assholes?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:18 PM;I honestly can't say. Never used that method.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:18 PM;Someone mentioned something about it...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:19 PM;But I could be wrong;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:19 PM;"Another boss, once defeated, drops 16 Wizard Stones. Use Ice Mag refine";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:20 PM;Does the game tell you what things refine into before you actually refine?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:20 PM;Yes;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:21 PM;And the ratio;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:23 PM;"Actually I think I might have something, dunno if its worth replacing my safety bit though";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:25 PM;And what's that?;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:26 PM;"I can't remember what its called, lemme check an item list or something";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:29 PM;"Ah, I have a White Cape";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 01:29 PM;That could work;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:30 PM;"I don't know if it would make a difference though, because wouldn't he just turn someone else? Then again I've like, never seen him frog anyone except cloud";;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Aug-18 01:32 PM;I was the one who mentioned Waters. Water is the first most powerful magic available early game Junction it to STR;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:33 PM;Ah. Ok.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:34 PM;"I always had my best shit on cloud. Ribbon. Ziedrich, etc.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:34 PM;No materia outside of hp plus.;;

VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:36 PM;"Well, I'll try getting my white cape on. And the reason I have my ribbon on barret is because if memory serves me right he's the lowest hp cap in my party, he needs the extra protection";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 01:36 PM;Do you have Regen?;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:37 PM;"I do, it's pretty helpful.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 01:38 PM;"I can't remember which materia has regen though. I'm thinking about pairing it with my all, it would make keeping people high up a lot easier";;

VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:11 PM;Only thing I gotta worry about with the levelling now is trying to make sure I get to 98 but NOT 99;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:12 PM;Why are you trying to get to level 98? lol;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:13 PM;"Because I've played Sephiroth enough times that I'm going to go insane if I'm not as strong as possible to beat him, but in this server im told if anyones at 99 his hp will just scale up";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 04:14 PM;I'd worry more about your setup than your levels;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:15 PM;Lol it's fine;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:15 PM;I think I finished the game at 60;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:15 PM;And I was overleveled;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:15 PM;"Don't worry, most FF games don't require you to grind much for the final boss";;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Aug-18 04:17 PM;Yeah levels typically dont matter as the mechanics of each game matter more really;;
DRFlyer#2215;12-Aug-18 04:17 PM;"(I just beat ff3, tell that to the cloud lmao)";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:17 PM;The simple answer at this point is im just not good enough at the game. I can only make changes to the setup so many times before I realise I'm still not getting anywhere;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:18 PM;"I mean, if you tell me you are level 10 I will believe you lmao";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:18 PM;Yeah. I was lower level than you. Do you have enemy skill materia?;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:18 PM;I don't think you can be at that point and be underleveled;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:19 PM;"I do, but I've never found it very useful.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:19 PM;Yeah. Sephiroth is not the toughest main story boss in the game at all.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:19 PM;Do you have big guard?;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:20 PM;... Please tell me you're joking. No boss anywhere else in the game has given me nearly as much trouble.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:20 PM;Ha. I’m serious. You’ve beaten tougher bosses. This is just about set up.;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:21 PM;It's true;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:21 PM;"I mean I went through several phases with the setups, 1. Totally changing to other peoples setups. Didn't work, 2. Sticking to my original setup and hoping for the best, 3. Using my own setup but making minor changes here and there.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:22 PM;The only final boss that is the hardest final boss in all FFs is probably ~~Yu Yevon~~ Zeromus;;

DRFlyer#2215;12-Aug-18 04:23 PM;Yea I did;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:23 PM;I had more trouble with my first fight against exdeath;;

Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;What? lmao;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;Go get big guard and maybe a ribbon. Done deal.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;Well I guess now you can get out of the dungeon @VOLTAG3#1137;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;Demon Wall and Carry Armor are tougher in my opinion.;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;ff6 used to be known as ff3 wasnt it?;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;Only in the west;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:25 PM;so ff3 was always ff3 just not released in the usa till recently;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:26 PM;Yep!;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:26 PM;I need to play it;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:26 PM;is the job system like 5's?;;
DRFlyer#2215;12-Aug-18 04:26 PM;It's...an interesting game;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:27 PM;It's an inferior job system;;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:27 PM;Still had fun;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:27 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 I'll give you that, Carry Armour and Demon Wall were very tough, but they were manageable enough still, I had 3 or 4 attempts on each.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Aug-18 04:28 PM;"It can be brutal at some points though, especially at the final dungeon";;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:28 PM;ah;;
DRFlyer#2215;12-Aug-18 04:28 PM;3 was much harder than 1 or 2 for me;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:28 PM;"I tried playing through ff9 and 8 with a guide so I could have a somewhat easy time and understand the game better, but it feels like using a guide is tedious";;

Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:29 PM;I really wanna understand ff8 better;;
Nobuo#3856;12-Aug-18 04:29 PM;on one of the guides they say there's a way to get OP early;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:38 PM;"I only died three times in the game. Once to the midgar zolom, once to carry armor, and once to emerald weapon because I was curious.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:47 PM;No its fine.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:48 PM;I was like this with VI.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:48 PM;Phoenix cave. Jesus. It broke me.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:48 PM;And Phoenix I dont know how to make use of enemy skill anyway so big guard wont be of any use to me.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:49 PM;Get big guard. Cast it at the beginning of any boss fight. Profit.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:50 PM;"I’m not good at these games either. I love them, but i suck. That said, I know I can overcome myself if I’m geared.";;

VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 04:50 PM;"Like I said, i dont know how to use enemy skill and id probably have to rely on rnjesus to get big guard anyway now i think about it.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:51 PM;Nope.;;
pokemongenius#1474;12-Aug-18 04:51 PM;No;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:54 PM;Big guard you learn from an easily-accessible enemy.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 04:54 PM;"And to use enemy skill, cast it like it’s a spell (because it is)";;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 05:00 PM;Thanks. I guess I'll try that tomorrow. Last ditch solution.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 05:01 PM;It’s not last ditch. You’re fine. You just rolled into the final dungeon unprepared. It happens.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 05:03 PM;"I know everyone's saying its the materia, but ive changed the setup around so many times with no results that I just dont think it can be anymore. Then again it might be because some of the materia in those setups aren't in my inventory so i have to improvise a bit.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 05:04 PM;Just get big guard. We can talk after you win.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 05:04 PM;Cast big guard at the start of the boss fights (each one) and it really helps with damage reduction.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 05:07 PM;Pfft... I love how even after 10+ attempts you still say that to me with confidence. Youre a part of the reason i havent totally thrown the towel in.;;
VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 05:11 PM;Even after several mental breakdowns 😅;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 05:27 PM;I’m an enabler.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 05:27 PM;"But seriously. Just google big guard. Go get it... wait, do you have the manipulate materia?";;

VOLTAG3#1137;12-Aug-18 05:37 PM;What's MM anyway? million-million? XD;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Aug-18 05:55 PM;Sure.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Aug-18 09:06 PM;@VOLTAG3#1137 have you tried lowering the battle speed?;;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 12:54 AM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661 What do you mean by that?;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 12:59 AM;"Battle speed determines how fast the ATB gauges fill up for your party and for enemies. Setting it lower makes battles go by slower, so bad for grinding. But it's beneficial for boss fights so you get as much time as possible to react to actions";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Aug-18 01:00 AM;You can change it in the options;;
Marcello#4574;13-Aug-18 01:03 AM;"@Rasea#1840 @VOLTAG3#1137 setting it to lower actually makes battles go faster. It's a very unintuitive setting, yep.";;
Marcello#4574;13-Aug-18 01:04 AM;Another way to make it a bit easier is to select wait instead of recommended or active. It will halt the battle when you're selecting an enemy or going through magic/items menu;;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 02:51 AM;... It's done. You don't gotta put up with my whining anymore XD;;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 03:25 AM;"And I kept my speed and active thing the same, I didn't wanna make it TOO easy. But big guard did the trick in the end. It was still a good, challenging fight, but I won. But to be honest I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of needing a specific enemy skill to make a certain boss battle fun.";;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 03:35 AM;Because what are the chances you'll A - know how enemy skill works (since they don't really explain it in-game) B - Know the location of the enemy and C - know the enemy has big guard without outside assistance?;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 03:42 AM;"Yeah, FF has a pretty long track record with stuff like that. They've explained things better as time has went on as far as descriptions go and stuff. But there's still stuff they don't tell you or interactions which are fairly important in some games";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 03:42 AM;They basically either expect you to do a lot of trial & error yourself or look up the information online;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 03:42 AM;And the latter only exists because lots of people do the former and compile the information for people to have access to;;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 04:24 AM;"I agree. Just for the record though, I'm not saying FF7's a bad game, it's great, I had a good time with it, but it has some blemishes when it comes to properly explaining some of the mechanics.";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:28 AM;"Yeah, plenty of FF games do that. On purpose or otherwise. It's also one of those things you notice when a game ages. Since modern games usually take the time to explain things better whereas games in the 80s and 90s don't for the most part";;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 04:31 AM;"I mean personally I'm more of a fan of games like, teaching you through game design rather than tutorialising everything like you're an idiot (if you've seen egoraptor's sequelitis stuff you'll get what I'm talking about) but for an RPG that doesn't really work, it's too complex for the game to just throw up its arms and say you'll be fine.";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:33 AM;"Though even some PS2 games were like that. Like uh... FFX-2. The blue mage class in that game is called Gun Mage. In order for you to learn blue magic, the enemy had to use its skill on you. One of the best skills, White Wind (heals 1/3rd of your max HP and removes all status ailments, affects the entire party), was only obtainable from a few enemies., , The kicker is that you can't possibly know that they have it as they won't use it unless they're confused. And you have to keep them confused and wait for that small chance that they use it on your Gun Mage(s) in order to learn it";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:34 AM;"And yeah, I get what you mean. Totally agree there";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:34 AM;RPGs tend to be fans of trial by fire most times;;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 04:38 AM;"Wow, that's... Incredibly complicated. I mean I don't really like this learn skills by enemies attacking you with them kinda thing, I think skills should be earned through level-ups or as drops from tough enemies, because then you're earning it, not taking random chances for it.";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:43 AM;"Well, it can be argued that blue magic is being earned too. There's a lot of trial & error involved in it, so you can learn them all yourself by just subjecting every enemy to various conditions and stuff. But usually it's pretty straightforward. Barring that, it's a reward for knowing game mechanics. Though that's really just read a guide and do this to get skills";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:43 AM;"I like blue magic as a concept. Being able to use cool enemy skills that only a specific class has access to, which makes them stand out from the typical FF class archetypes";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 04:43 AM;"Of course, it's always balanced like ass and 2-3 moves end up overshadowing everything else";;
VOLTAG3#1137;13-Aug-18 05:08 AM;"I guess that's fair enough, I can't comment on blue magic as a whole, I've yet to play X yet, I own it on vita but... I never make use of my Vita anymore because of the Switch so its kinda pointless.";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:14 AM;"Lmao, yeah :p FFX is a wonderful game, honestly. Even better if you just care about the story and ignore the postgame";;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:14 AM;VIII and X probably have the best versions of obtaining blue magic I've played;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:14 AM;You only need an item drop from an enemy to learn them in VIII and Kimahri only has to use Lancet on an enemy to learn them in X;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:15 AM;"Oh yeah, forgot Kimahri makes obtaining blue magic super easy";;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:15 AM;No BS with needing to confuse an enemy to get it to use a healing or buffing move on a specific party member like in VII or X-2;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:15 AM;Only caveat being some of the moves are missable since they're tied to bosses;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:16 AM;I suppose so;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:16 AM;I think the big caveat is it's an overdrive;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:16 AM;*cough* LIKE ON THE OMEGA WEAPON *cough*;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:16 AM;Aye;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:16 AM;"If you could use the moves whenever, it would be cooler";;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:17 AM;"As it stands, it plays almost no realistic role during a playthrough since full overdrives are more or less hard to come by until late game";;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:17 AM;I think VOLTAG3 would like X;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:17 AM;"Yeah :/ Even with warrior/slayer overdrive types, it's still kinda blegh";;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:17 AM;It seems to resolve a lot of the issues of VII;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:18 AM;Even if the end result is a little stripped down;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:19 AM;"I've been replaying it again and I just got Rikku, I'm gonna try to keep her active in the party unlike my previous playthroughs";;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:19 AM;I always did that :p;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:20 AM;I recall;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:21 AM;I'd like to make use of Kimahri and Rikku more than I have in the past;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:21 AM;Since they tend to be my most underused;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:23 AM;Mine tend to be Kimahri and Auron;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 05:27 AM;Though I need to see how that one Youtuber builds Kimahri. Since I think he takes him down Auron's path but uses one of the ability spheres to pick up Steal so Rikku doesn't have to be the steal-bot all the time;;
Olde#8956;13-Aug-18 05:42 AM;Kimahri-only will probably be my next playthrough;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 06:21 AM;Never doing that :P Only one I'd consider doing would be Rikku;;
DRFlyer#2215;13-Aug-18 08:27 PM;Anyone have advice for how to make the Steam version of FF4 more bearable? The battle is just so bad fps wise;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Aug-18 08:32 PM;"It's a port of the mobile version, which is a port of the DS version. What did you expect?";;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:30 PM;So i keep playing ff6 mobile but i also keep getting rid of it.....is there anyway i can start around the time where all the characters meet up at starting town place in WoB;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:30 PM;Like save files or something;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Aug-18 10:31 PM;I guess there is... but why don't you just power through the first parts of the game with a guide or something?;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:32 PM;I get burned out easily at beginning;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:33 PM;The beginning is very boring cause of forced characters and like no customization with espers or anything;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:33 PM;It takes several hours to get to where im talking about so im looking for a way to get there quickly;;
Rasea#1840;13-Aug-18 10:34 PM;"Stop getting rid of it then? o.o If you want to actually play it but only periodically, just keep it around so you don't lose progress";;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:35 PM;Im planning on it but i wanna syart where i was before;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:35 PM;Is there save files or something that i could download to start farther;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;13-Aug-18 10:44 PM;Welp it sounds like no one knows so i guess ill just power through it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:48 AM;I have questions about 8... but it’s too late for me to ask.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:48 AM;6 hours of delays today. Flying sucks.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:49 AM;"But 8 is pretty good. So i got the lamp, saved, and then got my ass handed to me by diablos. Is that supposed to happen ?";;
Trickster#9840;14-Aug-18 01:52 AM;He can a be a bit tough the first time.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Aug-18 01:53 AM;"My tip is to use Blind on him, and go to town with Limits";;
Trickster#9840;14-Aug-18 01:53 AM;Also you can draw and cast demi on him.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:54 AM;Yeah I was doing that for high damage.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:54 AM;But still couldn’t handle it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:54 AM;Limits too.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:55 AM;Zell limit is hysterical. Keep rolling the button presses.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 01:56 AM;Do I need to defeat Diablos now or can I wait before I summon him from the lamp?;;
Trickster#9840;14-Aug-18 01:56 AM;You can wait;;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:03 AM;"My advice is take him on as soon as you can, using Squall, Zell, and Selphie";;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:04 AM;"Diablos will probably cast Demi or Gravija on you if you cast Blind on him, but those can't kill you because they only do damage based on a certain percentage of your health (1/4 for Demi, 3/4 for Gravija)";;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:04 AM;"If he uses Gravija, he should put you in the perfect range for you to use limit breaks";;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:05 AM;"Selphie has Full-Cure (random option in Slots) which is reliable for healing, while Squall's Renzokuken and Duel are both effective for damage (for Duel, just alternate Punch Rush and Booya)";;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:05 AM;Otherwise you can spam GFs and they'll take damage for your characters if you're afraid of having the characters take too much damage;;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:11 AM;"The reason I think he's worth getting as soon as you can is because once you get him, you can junction him and start learning Enc-Half and Enc-None, which are immensely helpful.";;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:12 AM;"Mug, too";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Aug-18 02:12 AM;"He also has Time Mag Ref, which is *really* useful if you *really* want to break the Game";;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:12 AM;Oh  yeah;;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 02:12 AM;Quake and Triple junction really well;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 02:54 AM;I pulled a bunch of doubles off someone.;;
Olde#8956;14-Aug-18 04:11 AM;Elvoret probably;;
pokemongenius#1474;14-Aug-18 08:22 AM;Yup;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;14-Aug-18 10:47 AM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 as you level up enemies level up so thats why its recommended that u beat diablos immediately cause it is only gonna get harder;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 11:26 AM;"ok, i'll try again later";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Aug-18 11:26 AM;thanks for the tips;;

Perrydice#9311;14-Aug-18 01:53 PM;"I like the voice acting work done on Final Fantasy IV on the DS. I felt the quality of the voice acting was good enough to where it provided more depth to the characters, such as Cecil, Kain, and Rydia. In fact, I think Kain's voice is excellent. The writing is much more improved, especially from the original SNES version.  It's a really challenging game, which is a plus because I felt the SNES version was butchered and way too easy for me (although I didn't have to grind because it was so easy, that's a plus I guess).";;

Perrydice#9311;14-Aug-18 02:05 PM;"@Psychotic Ninja#0661 I respectfully disagree.  I have played the original Japanese version and I think the DS version is much harder.  It isn't easy like the SNES version but it isn't too challenging.  Final Fantasy V is much harder than the Japanese version of Final Fantasy, but that's my opinion.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:09 PM;FF1 and FF2 for example were not put on the store (they came long before that was even a thing on the PSP) so you'd have to settle for the PSX versions instead if you are on ofw;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:10 PM;yeah it really doesn't matter for most people;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:10 PM;especially when UMDs were one of the worst forms of media to have ever existed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:10 PM;even by 2005's standards;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:10 PM;it was absolute trash;;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:11 PM;"I mean, its better than those tiny cartridges that can easily get lost all other modern handhelds like to use.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:11 PM;no it isn't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:11 PM;it was slow as shit and extremely fragile;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:12 PM;you couldn't even carry other UMDs with you unless you had a specific carrying case to hold them in or risk them breaking in your pocket;;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:13 PM;"I mean, I've personally never had a UMD break on me, but then again I never tended to carry extra games around me, I was usually content playing whatever I had in there at the time.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:15 PM;The biggest issue with them was the poor case they were housed in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:15 PM;the actual disc part itself was a normal cd/dvd in terms of quality;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:15 PM;but if that outter shell got even the slightest bit of pressure it would crack and break apart;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:15 PM;very cheap plastic;;

VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:17 PM;"I mean I can say that if a console tried umd nowadays itd be irrelevant. Because as far as im aware cd based stuff like that was the only way to get decent sounding music on a system, but times have changed and cartridges dont have any sound disadvantage";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:18 PM;It was not the only way;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:19 PM;"the problem was that carts didn't usually have the space to hold music, so cart based games years ago (this includes retro systems from the 90s) used synthesized music that was done real time";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:20 PM;"but even during the era that the PSP released, there was certainly viable cartridge media Sony could've used instead";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:20 PM;"at the very least, the UMD's main flaw was the outer shell";;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:22 PM;"Well, to be honest i still prefer the psp regardless of format, because there were a lot of games on it. ps vita had a case of wii u-itis, not much ever gets released for the thing, third parties support it better than sony themselves do!";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:22 PM;It has a lot on it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:23 PM;"Vita and PSP have very similar software support, in being that most of it came from japanese developers making games";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:23 PM;the only difference is that the Vita lacked what was already a lackluster first party lineup on the handheld;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:24 PM;neither one were particularly well supported in the west and lived solely off of japan's support which the Vita does have;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:24 PM;in addition to still being able to play PSP games;;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:27 PM;"I mean, I'll give it one thing, the vita had a lot of ps1 ports on it, as far as i know it was the first time a lot of the games they ported became portable.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:27 PM;I'm pretty sure it just mirrors the same catalog the PSP's PS1 classics had;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:28 PM;I don't recall them adding anything new but both essentially played PS1 games natively;;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:30 PM;"Fair enough. But I'm just saying, the vita was kind of a massive failure in the end, no-one can deny that. Its kinda just there, unless sony can pull out something that can rival or even be better than the switch, i dont see much of a future in the handheld lineup, id rather they stick to home consoles from now on.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:31 PM;They don't care;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:31 PM;that's why it failed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:32 PM;because they saw how horrible the PSP did and since they got their shit together with the PS3;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:32 PM;they didn't need a handheld to win over people (or even free online for that matter but that's a different story);;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Aug-18 04:32 PM;The vita is a perfectly serviceable handheld that suffered from really shitty first party support;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Aug-18 04:32 PM;"In fact, it has the opposite problem that the Wii U had";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:32 PM;What the handheld does do it does very well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:33 PM;whether it was trying to be better than the switch or Nintendo's handhelds isn't even a question since none of them ever were;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:33 PM;The Wii U's problem was that it had no 3rd party support;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:33 PM;and was literally a generation behind;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Aug-18 04:34 PM;The Vita is entirely supported by 3rd party titles with no first party support;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Aug-18 04:34 PM;The opposite situation of the Wii U lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Aug-18 04:34 PM;"Sony just dropped the Vita off at the Orphanage, and left";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:34 PM;pretty much lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Aug-18 04:35 PM;Yeah that's accurate...;;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:35 PM;"Also when it came to physical releases, the vita was trash at that. At least from my experience, vita cartridges are a little hard to find and kinda expensive when they are found.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:36 PM;"They weren't so much hard to find, no retailers had much of a reason to sell them";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:37 PM;which is really the only thing the Vita truly did worse;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;14-Aug-18 04:38 PM;it's just lumped in with those now;;
VOLTAG3#1137;14-Aug-18 04:38 PM;"And to clarify i made the wii u comparison  that it didnt have a lot of games, i didnt say it was third party trouble. Same issue, different cause i guess you could say.";;

Marcello#4574;14-Aug-18 08:37 PM;VII is my favourite but I don't like saying it's the best;;
Rasea#1840;14-Aug-18 08:38 PM;"I always considered X to be better than XII overall. XII has some nice parts. Rare game, trophy game, license board is fun, marks, nice optional bosses. But the story is... enh. And it's really easy until postgame which isn't the case with X., , I like X because the story feels like a story and doesn't have bad pacing like XII. It's a nice journey. It's also pretty hard to be OP or outlevel enemies/bosses. You can't really trivialize them unless you take the time to abuse Rikku's Mix. Being able to control how powerful you are is a big boon imo. And the CTB system makes the combat fast, but gives all your actions more... oomph, which is important imo";;
Emiruko#0314;14-Aug-18 08:40 PM;"XII does have a few pacing issues due to development problems, but over all I quite like the story and how it's smaller in scope than the planet is in danger I really do like X as well though";;

Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:15 PM;You travel into the past;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:16 PM;Which doing this makes enemies in the past stronger than the present;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:16 PM;Due to a massive war happening;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:16 PM;Chains of Promithia you just get access to more zones and endgame of it let's you travel into a marine like zone fans call sea;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:17 PM;Rise of the zilart is the same but the endgame zone is called sky since you are pretty much on a floating island in the sky;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;14-Aug-18 10:17 PM;cool;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:19 PM;Game was really fun;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:19 PM;And honestly still is;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:19 PM;If you play on a private server;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:20 PM;I play on one called nasomi;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:20 PM;That only has 4 expansions;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;14-Aug-18 10:24 PM;but the junction system is what i didnt like;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:24 PM;The magic being used as items is what I didn't like;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;14-Aug-18 10:24 PM;same;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:25 PM;The rest I was fine with;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Aug-18 10:25 PM;Also;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;14-Aug-18 10:25 PM;lol;;
Emiruko#0314;14-Aug-18 10:59 PM;"One of the most unfortunate myths surrounding the game is the idea that Basch was supposed to be the main character, but was swapped out with Vaan last minute in order to appeal to Japanese fans. Like all myths, there is some truth to the myth, but not to the degree people exaggerate. While it is true that focus testing did occur, it happened very early on before the game's design document was even completed. This means the game's story was still in a conceptualized state and quite nebulous. After focus testing finished up, the findings were incorporated into the game's design. This means that Final Fantasy XII's final draft of the story was written to include Vaan. ";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;15-Aug-18 12:13 AM;That’s interesting stuff;;
Emiruko#0314;15-Aug-18 12:15 AM;"I was late on a response, and it's kinda a text wall lmao";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:14 AM;That Basch would've been the main character is news to me;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:14 AM;Balthier makes more sense as a main character imo;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:15 AM;But Vaan is clearly the Luke Skywalker of FFXII;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:15 AM;He just eventually becomes unnecessary;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:42 AM;It seriously baffles me that a side character and someone that's introduced as a greedy sky pirate is 5000% more interesting and gets more development than anyone else in the entire game;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:46 AM;"Well, he did say he was the leading man";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:47 AM;"What is really annoying is that Vaan is still considered the MC by Square Enix, instead of Ashe or even Balthier";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:49 AM;"I guess insofar as you're supposed to be looking at it or experiencing politics through Vaan's eyes, that is the eyes of a person for whom all the foreign policy and war is foreign, then I guess it makes sense? Sort of like how X was really Yuna's journey, Tidus was kind of only connected incidentally via Jecht, then the connection was made stronger with the whole dream of the fayth thing.";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:49 AM;"Well, as mentioned, it's been reasoned that Vaan is the observing protagonist rather than an active element";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:50 AM;"Also what Fran said is true. Basch was meant to be the main character but at the time of development, teenage characters (Vaan & Penelo) were much more appealing to the focus groups that XII was targeting";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:50 AM;"And as you know, sales is always more important than integrity or good writing";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:50 AM;"Blah, focus groups...";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:50 AM;Basch being the MC would be even more annoying tbh;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:51 AM;My vote is for Balthier;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:51 AM;I really hate Basch's story arc;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:51 AM;"I didn't know there was that much to hate, tbh";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:51 AM;"See, that's something that annoys me about the way XII approaches storytelling";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:52 AM;I mean... I don't hate him;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 05:52 AM;"Actually, when Vaan replaced Basch as the main character, he was very different. His original concept had him as a much more serious and rugged character. He was also named Aqua. The focus testing came later, and Vaan's personality was changed to appease marketing.";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:52 AM;It's just that it had some good potential because of the prologue's plot twist;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:52 AM;Then it was really disappointing to see how it turned out;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:52 AM;Anyone that's not Balthier or Ashe gets arcs. They get a specific segment in the story where it focues on them. Then the rest of the game they have a line or two or a short sequence and that's basically it;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:53 AM;How dare they try and soil Aqua's good name;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:53 AM;"Heretics, burn them 🗡 🔥";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:53 AM;"So it seems like they made decisions based on marketing, right...";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:53 AM;I also heard that the lead story developer left halfway through production;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:53 AM;"Good job screwing up again, Square.";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:54 AM;Which might explain why the plot takes a nosedive at the halfway point of the game? Idk if it's true though;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:54 AM;Vayne had a lot of potential but ends up being horribly generic;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:54 AM;inb4 Occuria were hamfisted in;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:54 AM;I don't even pay attention to the second half;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:54 AM;Doctor Cid is the true villain tbh;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:54 AM;It feels so shoveled in;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 05:55 AM;"Matsuno left a year before the game came out, because of health issues, but a lot of people think that it was really due to creative differences (e.g. all the Vaan changes).";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:55 AM;I thought that Occuria who's with Cid is the real villain;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:55 AM;I suspect it was probably due to external pressures forcing him to make rewrites;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:57 AM;I lost track of the story after Bhujerba;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:57 AM;"After that, it was all over the place";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:57 AM;Honestly I don't blame you;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:57 AM;"Ehhh, technically, Venat's a good guy. He helps Cid (and therefore Vayne) commit various atrocities that cause a loss of life on a rather large scale. But Venat was exiled by the other Occuria because Venat believed that humanity deserved the right to take their own path and write their own history. Whereas the proper Occuria believe themselves to be gods of Ivalice and must guide humanity down the proper path (read: their path they choose)";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:58 AM;"Ah, that does sound familiar";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:58 AM;"The reins of fate back in the hands of man, I think was the line";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:58 AM;"XII's sequel, Revenant Wings, enforces that by having the Occuria commit more atrocities towards another race because they're doing things the Occuria doesn't like";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:58 AM;What system was RW for?;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:58 AM;That's interesting. I never thought like that.;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:59 AM;DS I think?;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 05:59 AM;"DS, yeah";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:59 AM;"Ah, fair enough";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 05:59 AM;Is it...any good?;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 05:59 AM;...probably not lmao;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:00 AM;"It's good, yeah. It suffered on the original DS because of the screen size. So the recent DS systems are better for it. It's a tactical RPG type thing and has a nice story";;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:00 AM;"I like the story, found the gameplay to be weird and not particularly fun";;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:00 AM;"they made Vaan cool in it, which I appreciated";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:01 AM;And a proper villain as well;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:01 AM;I'd play/watch it had I liked XII's story. It doesn't interest me.;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:01 AM;Not to mention Vaan actually *does things for once*;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:02 AM;Maybe I should play Tactics...;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:02 AM;"Yeah, it's one of those deals that's only interesting if you care about the worldbuilding of the original game and liked the characters and want more of it";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:02 AM;"Eh, I don't think the gameplay style is for me";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:02 AM;It's likened to Tactics as well;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:03 AM;"The gameplay bit, anyways";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:03 AM;"Then definitely not, lol";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:04 AM;"Not that I think Tactics is a bad game by any stretch, just not for me";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:04 AM;Yeah :p;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:04 AM;"I like TRPGs quite a bit, personally";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:04 AM;"I'm the opposite, lol";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:04 AM;RIP :P;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:05 AM;"Whatever, I don't own a DS anyway so at most what I'd probably do is watch someone else who knows what they're doing play the game";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:06 AM;Dat edit 👀;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:06 AM;"I don't dislike any genre, I'm sure there are great games behind genres I never played much.";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:06 AM;"Well, there's the DS emulator";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:07 AM;"There's a fair amount of genres I dislike, though exceptions sometimes exist within those genres";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:07 AM;I like editing;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:07 AM;And the DS emulator for Android is actually better than any emulator on PC;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:07 AM;I mean;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:07 AM;I'm not a fan of JRPGs;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:07 AM;Yet I enjoyed playing FF and eventually got into games like Berseria and Persona 5;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:08 AM;">not a fan of JRPGs, >literally in a FF server and KH server, 👀";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:08 AM;"And Skyrim, don't forget about Skyrim";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:08 AM;👀;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;Skyrim = JRPG of the millenium;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;Skyrim 2 is coming tho;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;"I dislike... shooters, racing, horror... some others I'm forgetting";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;"I tend to dislike sci-fi settings as well, but that's not a genre";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;I don't like horror games either;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;But I love Resident Evil;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:09 AM;"Yeah, me neither";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:10 AM;I dislike RE;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:10 AM;RE isn't as horror as you'd think;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:10 AM;"But meh, to each their own";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:10 AM;"I've played 1, 4, 5, and 6";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:10 AM;"None of them grabbed me, they were all kind of bad in their own ways";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:10 AM;>=4 are action games though;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:12 AM;"Well, more often than not, people dislike horror games because either they dislike the common elements used in them (RE's thing being zombies) or the more rare but still prevalent intentionally bad gameplay or loss of control or weak character to reinforce horror and powerlessness";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:12 AM;I dislike horror games for the cheap horror elements like jump scares;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:13 AM;Don't forget the horribly obscure puzzle design (cough Silent Hill);;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:13 AM;That too;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:13 AM;"RE didn't really have bad gameplay, but you'd rarely get annoyed by them";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:13 AM;Though the early Silent Hill games are basically masterpieces;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:13 AM;RE had terrible gameplay I thought;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:13 AM;"But again, to each their own. No game is above criticism.";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:14 AM;Yeah I still want to play the early Silent Hill games;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:14 AM;Except games that you like that other people don't;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:14 AM;:>;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:14 AM;Not even games that I like are above criticism;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:15 AM;I don't think there's a single game I enjoy where I can't point out at least ten things wrong with it;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:16 AM;"It just all comes down to personal preference, I guess";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:17 AM;"It's hard for me to point wrong things with the games I enjoy the most, because I don't usually go looking out for faults. People say I have low standards but at least it makes me enjoy games more.";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:18 AM;Omg saaaaaaame;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:18 AM;I catch shit for engaging stuff that way but I rather enjoy it;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:18 AM;~~Also you can't say anything is wrong with FF6 or 7 otherwise you'll have a rabid fanbase attempting to rip your throat out~~;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:19 AM;~~I think I repel people with positive feelings and attract people with negative attitudes because I think I'm constantly overanalyzing and being very critical and raining on people's parades~~;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:19 AM;lol It used to be that way with FF7;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:19 AM;"~~ehhhh there's plenty of wrong stuff in VII, but there are many other memorable moments that makes them irrelevant to me~~";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:19 AM;I think people's attitudes toward 7 have changed *a ton*;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:19 AM;~~and I consider IV the only flawless FF~~;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:20 AM;"Actually I'd say that it seems like more people in this Discord enjoy 12 over 7, at least from what I've read from current posters";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:21 AM;Reddit and Gamefaqs is pretty intense about 6 and 7 being the best thing since sliced bread. And people who played 7 in their childhood also tend to view it with nostalgia glasses;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:21 AM;"Well yeah, but admittedly most of those people have kind of moved on";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:22 AM;I played VII last year. I loved it so much.;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:22 AM;People still post on Gamefaqs?;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:22 AM;You'd be surprised;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:22 AM;"In fact, I played all titles from I to IX (except for II and VIII) between June and December last year.";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:23 AM;Reddit is hating on XIII right now;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:23 AM;The PC board is dead;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:23 AM;"For FF7, that is";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:23 AM;Most recent game boards are pretty active. The system boards have someone posting something every 5 seconds (not even kidding). FF15's board (the most recent FF game's board gets used as the discussion for all things FF) gets a post every 5 seconds as well;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:23 AM;When XVI releases that hate will shift to XV;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:23 AM;You can't sneeze without hitting 20 people shitting on XV;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:24 AM;Reddit doesn't hate XIII that much;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:24 AM;We get heavily upvoted posts constantly of people circlejerking over how underrated it is;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:24 AM;lmao I know;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;The Snow/Serah love story is so deep;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;"inb4 Squeenix pulls a miracle out of their ass and XVI somehow finds a nice balance between graphical fidelity, likeable characters and a good story";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;I posted once about XIII and got a surprisingly well reception;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;Are they even working on a XVI?;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;Definitely;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;XV posts are still shitshows and I hate seeing them;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:25 AM;"Though I think they're going to follow XV footsteps, so that scares me a lot.";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:26 AM;Honestly;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:26 AM;"XV still has some more content coming, and they also maintain XIV, along with VIIR in the works, so I imagine that XVI is in the pipeline currently";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:26 AM;XV doesn't get enough criticism;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:26 AM;"a follow-up to XV with an actually stable development cycle could be okay, I think";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:26 AM;They made such a great presentation and marketed it so well that people don't put much thought into it;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:27 AM;So it's considered a great success;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:27 AM;I thought the whole driving thing was a joke at first;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:27 AM;Then I saw someone play the game... O_O;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:27 AM;"Oh, and I forgot to respond to something earlier you said, Bienfu";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:27 AM;Also not having a single playable female character is kind of bullshit;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:28 AM;"When you said thanks a lot, Square or something. I wanted to be technical and pointed out that Square was actually a great company. Squaresoft, I think they were called. Then they merged with whatever Enix was and became Square Enix (aka Squeenix) and that's where their work started going down the drain for most people";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:28 AM;"Well, for Final Fantasy anyways";;

Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:29 AM;To not confuse them with the once-great Squaresoft;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:29 AM;"XII was made by SE, no?";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:29 AM;Everything after IX was made by SE if I'm not mistaken;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;X was SS I think;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;X-2 was the last Squaresoft;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;Funny how FF took a hit;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;But then SE made KH2;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;"Though, in fairness, XIV still stands to be a pretty nice FF game";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;"That is true, Rasea.";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:30 AM;Though that just lends credence to the fact that Squeenix just can't make JRPGs;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:31 AM;I don't have much interest in playing it because it's paid and I don't have enough time to put into it;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:31 AM;Tomb Raider has been great. XIV is a MMO. As is XI (which is also evidently pretty nice). Kingdom Hearts is obviously great as well;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:31 AM;Well;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:31 AM;TR wasn't made by SE though;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:32 AM;"SE did screw up one of the TR games because of shit deadlines, but otherwise they have been great";;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:33 AM;Which one is that? I've only heard good things about TR + Rise of TR;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:33 AM;"Anyway I'd love to talk about TR and KH but I have to get ready to class now, it's going to be a long day ughhh. I hope y'all have a great day!";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:33 AM;"Alrighty, have a good one!";;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:33 AM;I should leave too;;
Olde#8956;15-Aug-18 06:33 AM;See ya;;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:33 AM;"Angel of Darkness, I think, Rasea";;
Marcello#4574;15-Aug-18 06:34 AM;The reboot is incredible yeah;;
Rasea#1840;15-Aug-18 06:34 AM;Bye Bienfu 👋;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 08:25 AM;@Olde#8956 Final Fantasy X is made by Squaresoft.  I think Final Fantasy X-2 was the first Final Fantasy game officially made after the merger.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;15-Aug-18 08:26 AM;"Nah, it's Crystal Chronicles";;
Malfred#1000;15-Aug-18 09:11 AM;Indeed;;
Malfred#1000;15-Aug-18 09:11 AM;You could argue that X-2 was the first mainline FF made by SE.;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 09:19 AM;"Nah, it was released in Japan a month before the merger. It was published in the west later by SE, but it's still a Squaresoft game.";;
Malfred#1000;15-Aug-18 09:20 AM;"Weren't they already merged at that point, just not officially?";;
Malfred#1000;15-Aug-18 09:21 AM;I seem to recall them announcing the merger on the same day that it was approved.. but the process of merging had already happened.;;
Leon#9542;15-Aug-18 09:26 AM;"Ah, quick search says the process started in November 2002, so I suppose you could say X-2 counts.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;15-Aug-18 09:27 AM;It's complicated to know how the game's development proceeded during the merging process;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 10:00 AM;"Final Fantasy X was fun but I wouldn't consider it phenomenal, imho.  I think that X-2 has a fun gameplay but the story is not good and the writing is very poor.  There were several points in the game where I laughed really hard because the writing was so poor.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;15-Aug-18 10:45 AM;The writing in x-2 is poor;;

Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 11:26 AM;I like when Yuna talks to the main bad guy I don't like your plan...... it sucks! That line alone cracked me up so much because I didn't feel she was serious when confronting him.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:18 PM;"Ha, I just took down Diablos without blind";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:20 PM;"Also, where is the best area to farm some AP for my GFs this early in the game?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:20 PM;Realized I'm already 4 hours into the game...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:25 PM;Selphie rolled 2 Ultima spells against Diablos which was really helpful.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:39 PM;"Also, Quetzlcoatl... does he have to learn Card before he can learn Card Mod?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:39 PM;which I am assuming is simiilar to Diablos having to learn enc-half before learning enc-none?;;
Trickster#9840;15-Aug-18 12:41 PM;"Yes, Quetzalcoatl has to learn card first.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 12:46 PM;Thanks.;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:22 PM;Yeah certain GF abilities require a prerequisite such as an earlier ability or a certain level like Ifrits Mad Rush;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:24 PM;"I figured, I just wasn't sure.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:25 PM;I guess I'll do some AP grinding on the beach after work.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:26 PM;i just wanna beef up some of their abilities and then go play some cards before continuing the story in Balamb city;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:26 PM;Mmhmm a lil trick to beat fastitocalon is draw to force em outta the sand;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:26 PM;can i just summon GFs to make it really quick too?;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:27 PM;When there buried you deal less damage. If you boost then your fine;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:27 PM;"ah, ok";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:27 PM;im cool grinding for a bit.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:27 PM;im still level 9-10ish so i dont really care if i level up a little;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:28 PM;If you only want AP use Card to defeat enemies;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:28 PM;I'm not really worried about staying low level anyway. Once I have enc-none it sounds like it'll be a non-issue;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:28 PM;Right. I don't have that one yet but I think I'm about halfway to learning it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:28 PM;I got 20AP off Diablos earlier which helped;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:30 PM;If only you knew the power of Card. I dont wanna spoil it though;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:32 PM;Hmm... card mod i know the power of... but i guess card is probably a way to turn a lot of enemies into cards which I can then turn around and use card mod on?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:32 PM;so basically i can mod every enemy I fight into a card (although Im guessing some enemies are immune to being modded);;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:32 PM;Triple Triad breaks the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;"yeah, so I've heard";;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;Card is the gateway to get those cards;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;I have yet to play a single game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;So yeah;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;"ah, ok";;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;The rule system is dumb;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;"so I won't want to mod every card I get obviously, some I'll want to keep for uses of playing?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:33 PM;and then maybe mod some of THOSE cards I win in triple triad?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:34 PM;which mod into high-level spells which I then junction to something?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:35 PM;Yeah;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:35 PM;"You can do it all without battling, so no leveling";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:36 PM;"well I need to battle to use card, no?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:37 PM;"regarding rule system, yeah I saw there's a way to abolish random in Dollet (wherever that is) that supposedly makes Triple Triad much easier... then need card queen to spread diff rule to wherever she goes to... still don't know what the means but hopefully it becomes clear when i get to that point in the game";;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:37 PM;"No, I mean triple triad itself doesn't require you to battle";;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:37 PM;After you junction no enc you basically don't have to fight unless you're forced to;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Aug-18 01:38 PM;Later in the game there are some great places to get ap without much exp gain;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:46 PM;"oh, ok";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:46 PM;and will I basically want enc-none on at all times?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:46 PM;outside of grinding for AP or an enemy to card?;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:47 PM;"Early game is beat Ifrit, play cards in garden for Quistis, earn Card Mod, profit";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:47 PM;haha;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:51 PM;Yeah one thing anyone will tell you is Square was not prepared for players to actually learn the Junction system;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:57 PM;i definitely feel less lost in this game than i did in VI or VII;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:58 PM;I haven't really used a guide or anything yet as it relates to the story;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:58 PM;and I'm still getting through it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:58 PM;"in VI, I wouldn't have figured out a couple spots without a guide";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 01:58 PM;as in where to go;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 01:59 PM;This games fairly linear up until Disc 2 plus they always tell you where to go;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:07 PM;feels a little more like it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:07 PM;"i think just having played a couple FF games now, I kinda get the formula a little more";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:10 PM;which makes it more fun;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:10 PM;Starts linear gain some kinda travel opens up gains better travel rinse repeat;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:10 PM;"VI was actually pretty stressful, especially considering I had never done this JRPG/turn-based thing before";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:10 PM;"And when WoR opened up, I was like a deer in the headlights";;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:11 PM;Sounds like me;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:12 PM;"VII was a little better, I was less worried about being underpowered and shit";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:12 PM;and gearing up was way easier in VII;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 02:19 PM;"I felt that gearing up in Final Fantasy VII was way too streamlined. There was no strategy in what to equip in your characters, except for maybe double or triple materia growth. It pretty much was go with the better stat equipment.";;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:20 PM;Problem was characters didnt really matter too much a trend that was borrowed from the Job games before it;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 02:22 PM;"That's another criticism of Final Fantasy VII for me with the characters. As long as you balance your materia correctly, it really doesn't matter who you bring to the party.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:22 PM;agreed @Perrydice#9311;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:23 PM;"Yeah, VII I just brought my favorite chars... and the easiest to get the highest level shit for";;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 02:23 PM;Fair enough.;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 02:23 PM;"Just FYI, I like Final Fantasy VII.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:23 PM;"get some ribbons, couple ziedrichs... buy the high-level weapons from Mideel... boom, done from a gear standpoint. Then it's just finding all of the dope materia";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:23 PM;I loved FFVII;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:24 PM;I like the job games;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:24 PM;I think I'd like V since I've heard a lot about its job system;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 02:25 PM;"Yeah, it's a good game. I can definitely see why the game went mainstream. It's pretty easy to understand but it isn't so easy that you can just rapidly press A to move on like the NA SNES version of Final Fantasy IV.";;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 02:25 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Final Fantasy V, imho, has the best job system. I really enjoyed my time playing that game.";;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:25 PM;Actually you can just hold A;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:26 PM;"Yeah, I'd like to play V after I finish VIII and IX (and maybe X)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:27 PM;"Oh, one last random VIII question... I should have checked this when I was playing last night: if I draw and stock a spell that I already have junctioned, will those stocked spells get automatically added to the pool of that same spell already junctioned?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:27 PM;or do I have to manually add those spells later into the junctioned pool from the junction menu?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Aug-18 02:31 PM;It's in real time;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:31 PM;Yes if you have 100 no;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:31 PM;Max stock of any one spell is 100;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:33 PM;"right, ok";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:34 PM;thanks for the help guys;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 02:34 PM;I think I like planning and discussing FF games almost as much as I like actually playing.;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 02:36 PM;Anytime friend. Trying to prevent myself from instructing how to break these games is difficult;;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 03:13 PM;"@pokemongenius#1474 It is hard to do that because now when I play a game, I break it because I try to play it the most efficient way possible.";;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 03:19 PM;Essentially;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 03:24 PM;im all about effiency;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 03:24 PM;I don't want to ruin tooooo much of the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 03:25 PM;"but I just don't have time anymore to spend hours figuring out a certain part of the game, etc.";;
Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 03:25 PM;Time is key.  I can barely fit time to fit a 40-60 hour RPG game. It just takes me forever now.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Aug-18 03:34 PM;I am procrastinating at work badly right now looking at all of these refining and junctioning abilities;;
pokemongenius#1474;15-Aug-18 03:38 PM;XD i can imagine you thinking about the possibilities. Playing randos sure has taught me that;;

Perrydice#9311;15-Aug-18 04:17 PM;"I would never do the four job fiesta.  I don't have time and personally, I would rather just play it how I want with no limitations.  It's challenging enough, imho.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Aug-18 04:23 PM;I don't think it's all that challenging with how lenient the game can be (much like most FF games it's very entry level);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Aug-18 04:24 PM;"and the fiesta isn't really going against the designs either, it's just a bunch of self imposed challenges that make the game fun by allowing you to look at situations in a way you otherwise would never have never thought of";;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;18-Aug-18 06:58 PM;@Afro Smash#3720 i recommend mobile version because it has 3d graphics the new augment system map system and also doesnt have the hardness of ds version but there is a hard mode which is the same thing;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-18 06:59 PM;I recommend the PSP Complete edition because imo the 2D graphics are much better and the game can do without the forced voice acting;;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;18-Aug-18 07:04 PM;The voice acting grows on u quickly and there is only a few scenes anyways but the 3d graphics add life to their pixelated selfs;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-18 07:05 PM;I'd argue that the 2d sprites have much more personality than the 3d models;;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;20-Aug-18 04:31 PM;If anyone ever needs help with FF3 ask me;;

Perrydice#9311;20-Aug-18 04:32 PM;"In the original FFIII on the Famicom, I beat the game at level 52.";;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;20-Aug-18 04:32 PM;Original is different;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;20-Aug-18 04:33 PM;It is possible to beat the game at level 50  if u got high job levels but if your jobs r weaker like15-50 then u need to be above 60 for sure;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;20-Aug-18 04:34 PM;The levels i posted above r wat i see on every wiki;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;20-Aug-18 04:34 PM;It kinda depends on player skill so i just put the higher recommendations;;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;20-Aug-18 04:40 PM;Most job levels take around 10 actions;;

pokemongenius#1474;21-Aug-18 08:52 AM;Again there are fan fixes for it;;
Tristan Fire Sword#5918;21-Aug-18 10:49 AM;i have questions;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 11:37 AM;"In Final Fantasy VI, what order do you guys get all the characters in the WoR? Obviously, Celes, Edgar and Setzer are required.";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-18 11:41 AM;Locke for last because the phoenix cave is quite hard;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 12:07 PM;"Although I had a good strategy and got through it, it was a real challenge getting Locke at levels 31-33 with my team.";;
River#4775;21-Aug-18 12:54 PM;"i think i will go with: sabin, cyan,  terra,  relm, strago, mog, locke, shadow, and gau";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 01:02 PM;"I was just interested because at the mid point, it's kinda up to the player so there are different ways you can go about getting the players. One of the things I do like about FFVI, just like FF1, is you can break linearity.";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 01:03 PM;"I decided in my current playthrough to get Sabin, Edgar, Setzer, then Terra, Cyan, Gau, Shadow, Locke, and Relm. I don't have Strago, Mog, Umaro, or Gogo.";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 01:05 PM;"Last time I played, my final four was Locke, Terra, Relm, and Edgar. I am thinking about changing it up this time around except keep Terra in the final team.";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-18 01:06 PM;"Strago was quite difficult too, because of the boss";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-18 01:06 PM;But it's because of **the** gimmick;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 01:07 PM;Locke was challenging considering I went to the dungeon a little underleveled. I did gain like 4-5 levels for just about every character by the time I got Locke. And I remember that dungeon being way longer when I played it as a kid. Must be because I knew where to go.;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-18 01:08 PM;I meant to say the thing with Locke is that his location isn't obvious;;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-18 01:08 PM;I can't remember where you get the clues about his location;;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Aug-18 01:10 PM;You kinda just find him honestly;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 01:14 PM;"I looked it up. So you meet a man in the auction house in jidoor and he talks about a relic that can bring back wayward spirits.  He admits that only in the Imperial capital of Vector could a relic like that can be found. Then there is a hidden letter in the painting of Emperor Gestahl that tells you the treasure is lying somewhere in the mountains that forms a star. Since throughout the game, Locke talks about Rachel and that's why he wants to protect Terra and Celes so much.";;
Marcello#4574;21-Aug-18 01:15 PM;Deathgaze was easier to find 😏;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 01:43 PM;"Once I got Bum Rush, he was a piece of cake.";;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Aug-18 01:49 PM;That animation :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Aug-18 04:24 PM;Strago isn’t difficult to get. He’s just hanging outside of the tower. You don’t have to actually enter the dungeon. Just roll up with relm and he joins.;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Aug-18 04:26 PM;"I remember the hardest one to get was Locke, but he was a challenge to get because when I went after him, I was underleveled. I gained 4-5 levels just trying to get him and I use good strategies just to survive.";;

✘Claudio✘#1802;22-Aug-18 03:41 AM;For FF8 do the enemies level scale w/ everyone or just Squall?;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Aug-18 08:15 AM;"Quote by Fallacia at Gamefaqs., , It is the party average for everyone in your *active party*, but the formula is a bit more complicated. , , Enemies you face can be at both 4/5ths and 6/5ths of your Average Party Level (APL)., ,  So to figure out what level enemies you can face:, , APL - Add up the levels of your entire active party (the ones who are fighting), divide that value by the number of active party members, that number is your APL, , The lowest level random encounter you'll face: Multiply your APL by 0.8, , The highest level random encounter you'll face: Multiply your APL by 1.2, , The only exceptions are the Island Closest to Heaven/Hell where enemies are always level 100, the trip through LP where enemies are all randoms are level 1, encounters in the DSRC that add additional levels to the enemy, the Fire Cavern where all randoms are level 5, the final dungeon where you can face any monster at any level, and any boss with a level cap or fixed level.";;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 08:34 AM;@✘Claudio✘#1802 Generally with Squall. The level scaling is one of the reasons why the junctioning system isn't well executed.;;
River#4775;22-Aug-18 09:58 AM;@✘Claudio✘#1802  somebody tell me there was an achievement if you finish the game with the initial level of squall;;
River#4775;22-Aug-18 09:59 AM;(steam edition);;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Aug-18 01:36 PM;This is true;;
Connortative#1069;22-Aug-18 09:25 PM;Hey guys I’m getting my teeth kicked in on the 3rd Seymour fight in FFX. Any suggestions?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Aug-18 09:27 PM;"Don't forget, you can boost your Def (and Attk)with Cheer x5, *and* with a custom Def +20% armor (or any other def boosting armor). Also, it doesn't hurt to sacrifice a summon in time for Total Analyzation";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 09:40 PM;"Oh boi, that fight";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 09:53 PM;"Okay, who are you using and what are their power levels?, , Secondly, I'm assuming the third phase is the one kicking your butt. The one where he does Total Annihilation. Regardless, he has a specific order of things. So to break things down:, , 70,000 ~ 52,000. Nothing to worry about here. Cross Cleave hurts, but you should have Protect up on your weakest characters when it htis and they should easily survive., , 52,000 - 35,000. Only special thing here is that he opens with Protect, doing the same thing in the first phase. Of note, though, is that Zombie will be afflicted on you by Lance of Atrophy quite often, so be sure to cure it ASAP. As he will always cast Full Life afterwards., , 35,000 - 0. Here's the big one. So he *always* goes in a specific order. That order is:, , Seymour -> uses Reflect, Mort -> uses Auto-Attack Mode (this is purely to let the player know that Total Annihilation will be happening in a few turns, Seymour -> uses Flare on himself (always dispel Reflect before he does this, it'll do ~2,500 damage to him or it __will__ hurt you), Mort -> says Ready to annihilate, Seymour -> says Watches... and waits, Mort -> uses Total Annihilation. It's a two stage attack. The first stage is 6-8 hits (random) to randomly selected party members, then the second stage is a single attack to everyone. **Make sure Shell is up on everyone before it hits you.**, Seymour -> uses Flare on himself, Mort -> says Ready to annihilate, Seymour -> uses Reflect on himself if you dispelled it. Important note: he will say Watches... and waits if you didn't dispel Reflect. If you did, he won't say it, but him using Reflect also counts as the warning message., Mort -> uses Total Annihilation., , It loops from Seymour's self-flare at that point";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:00 PM;"Now, still answer that first question. But the ideal way to deal with the Seymour fight is to open with Tidus, Yuna, Rikku. Tidus will use Hastega, Yuna will be getting up Reflect on everyone, Rikku's there to heal with Al Bhed Potions and using Mix for Mighty G (Distiller + Curtain). Once Yuna has put Reflect on everyone, bring Auron out. (She can use items to Reflect/Protect/Shell Auron). Rikku can also heal through Reflect with Al Bhed Potions. Auron is there for his high offense., , Additionally, if you wish, once Tidus uses Hastega, swap him out for Wakka. Seymour is susceptible to Silence (50% rate). Which will help in the early parts";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:01 PM;"Some additional notes on that fight. Swap Yuna out regularly (allies stay hasted when swapped out, so make sure she is hasted if you haven't been keeping her up to par) to Dispel";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:03 PM;"Secondly, you can cheese the Seymour fight by poisoning him. If you bring out Lulu and hit him with Bio Fury, he'll likely be poisoned. Once he's poisoned, __do not attack him.__ Not before, during, or after. It'll take a whopping 50 turns, but you won't have to deal with anything but Atrophy/Full Life combo + Cross Cleave. Which is way easier than the Reflect, Flare, Total Annihilation loop in his third phase";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:03 PM;As poison keeps him in the first phase;;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:04 PM;"Also, you can buy 30 Holy Waters and customize Zombie Ward onto your armors to make Atrophy less of a pain";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:04 PM;As you can't Zombieproof until after Mt. Gagazet;;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:06 PM;"Oh, and don't hit Mort with Slow, Slowga or a Delay attack. He *will* counter with Slowga on your entire party. Unless the slow/delay attack kills Mort, in that case, he won't counter with it";;
Rasea#1840;22-Aug-18 10:09 PM;"In the case of Cross Cleave, should you want to deal with it better (or use the poison method), Seymour acts in this order:, , Lance of Atrophy -> Full-Life -> Lance of Atrophy -> Full-Life -> Dispel -> Cross Cleave -> loops from there";;

Perrydice#9311;23-Aug-18 02:59 PM;"My feelings are that the game is a smooth ride for the first 15-20 hours, and it gets thrown out the window by adding an extra 5 hours of BS at the end, if you didn't use a guide.";;

pokemongenius#1474;23-Aug-18 03:02 PM;If you say so;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Aug-18 03:09 PM;"Another reason why FFIII is lower is because I didn't like how they built up Xande as the main bad guy throughout the game, then all of the sudden he is mind controlled by Cloud of Darkness. Also, Cloud of Darkness is among the worst final bosses of all Final Fantasy games. If you play the original version, she uses only one move, Flare Wave, which does 1500-1800 hp a turn. It's an extremely boring fight because only using mindless tactics is what kills Cloud of Darkness. I know the DS remake adds some extra difficulty, but I just do not like the buildup of her character (although the Cloud of Darkness song is awesome).";;

ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:07 PM;I really don't understand why they were so hellbent on prevent progress.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:14 PM;"Nothing inherently wrong with that. XIII and XV both were focused more on the combat itself and other forms of acquisition. Multiple items from chests (I think FFX started the x5 Potion-esque thing, but feel free to correct me) and enemies dropping items more often or multiple items at the same time";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:14 PM;"Even though XII has a steal command and is fairly important, most stolen items are either curatives or used for the bazaar";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:15 PM;The problem is they intentionally made materials scarce in areas.;;

Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:19 PM;"Rarely did accessories, I think";;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:23 PM;And you're not really intended to grind before Pulse tbh;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:24 PM;"I like abilities, and I like my equipment to be invested in.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:24 PM;and I want suitable reward for my efforts.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:24 PM;Your only reward is making the game way easier;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:25 PM;It's like level 99 Cloud before even exploring the first reactor;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:25 PM;"So you breeze through the game and complain it was too easy, but in truth *that* was your only reward";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:25 PM;"YEah, but not in the way I wanted it. Gaining superior equipment and unusual strategies that come from that is much more rewarding than just being given a stat dump that lets you mow through enemies.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:26 PM;"I don't really understand that, though? I know that the Crystarium has 10 levels to it, each level locked behind story progress. People don't like that, I understand that. However, it also functions like a really weird sphere grid. You're never asked to invest a lot of points into the Crystarium at any given point. And you can, in fact, limit yourself because you choose when go through the Crystarium., , If you decide to grind out money for accessories and weapons and then spend those points in the Crystarium, that is your fault. You can just grind the equipment, or just grind the Crystarium. Things shouldn't be mind numbingly easy then";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:27 PM;"I went through the game at a normal pace, doing some average upgrading on the Crystarium and my equipment. Never anything excessive. Some fights were difficult, some I even died a few times in. It was enjoyable, and I was never overpowered";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:28 PM;I did my first upgrade in Taejin's Tower;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:28 PM;"Honestly the problem is you're not really given an indication of what anything's worth. Because FFX forced you to take things a few steps at a time and allowed you keep going, you had an idea of how powerful you were getting. Between FFXIII's insane number-count and general chaos, it's hard to tell what your character is really accomplishing.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:28 PM;*boing boing boing*;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:28 PM;Good times;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:29 PM;Moderating crysterium expendature is like trying to fill a glass of water from a tap with your eyes closed.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:29 PM;I did it pretty well then :P;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:29 PM;"It's anti-grinding, and that's bad for an RPG.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:29 PM;Oh bully for you. >.<;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:30 PM;"In the end, it's basically still trying to boss the player around.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:30 PM;"From what I remember, around Crystarium... 7, I think, was when the point expenditure got to that hey this is the indicator that you're meant to grind for these points level";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:31 PM;"...uhhh you sure you aren't a little biased or something? I'm not getting what you're saying, all I can get from this is I grinded so I made the game easy";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:31 PM;In the wrong way.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:31 PM;Giving me a stat dump doesn't feel as rewarding as building a weapon and strategy and character the way I want them.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:31 PM;"That's a bit unreasonable, because all RPGs work the same way";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:31 PM;Not at all.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:32 PM;"I can't speak for anyone else, but not only did I not have the points to fill out the Crystarium ever, I was starved for points between investing them into the side paradigms for all the characters";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Aug-18 09:32 PM;The game doesn't do a great job of telling you This is where you need to start grinding;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:33 PM;FF XIII has a wealth on unusual abilities. But they're all locked away in higher upgrade weapons and accessories.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:33 PM;It's not fun to be given a system that actively discourages you from using it.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:33 PM;Let me go look up the Crystarium to get a good idea;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;How does it discourages you from using it?;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;You used a high level upgrade and made the game easier;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;"Same for the crysterium. The Sphere Grid, even in early stages, gave you a number of situations where you could experiment, and much earlier than the Crysterium ever does. But by the time you're allowed to really do anything different with the crysterium, the cost is insanely high, and the character's stats are stacked so that it almost isn't worth it to class change.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;What did you expect?;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;Except I can't get the high level upgrades.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;That's my complaint.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:34 PM;"And like I said, I'm pretty sure Crystarium 7 begins to ask of you pretty steep points, which is an obvious indicator that you should be grinding at that level. Which means you avoid further advancement to prevent being overpowered for that point in the game";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;"You can, it's not hard to do upgrades";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;"The system that says Here, you can upgrade these, and custom build your character how you like....but we're gonna withhold resources.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;"Unless you're talking about the ultimate items, locked behind a lot of griding";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;It's absurdly easy to upgrade;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;Just getting enough gil to get an accessory maxed out takes ages.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;How is it easy!?;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;"I also don't think upgrading equipment was super difficult either. And even if you grinded for upgrades on equipment and accessores, __you were never forced to invest in the crystarium to also upgrade equipment__";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;The systems are seperate;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:35 PM;I don't get what you're getting at there;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:36 PM;You buy chipped fangs and superconductors and gg;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:36 PM;Takes too long.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:36 PM;Uhhhhh no???;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:36 PM;Gil comes in absurdly easy at late game;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:36 PM;Late game is too long.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:37 PM;That's asking too much for the game to offer you an easy farming spot then;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:37 PM;I think you're being unreasonable and maybe a little biased here;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:38 PM;"If it's too much, then why is this the only game I have a problem with it? I've never felt this limited by a system before. Even FFV was less stingy with it's rewards.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:38 PM;The best place to farm APB in V was in the final dungeon;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:38 PM;Why the hell do I have to late to late game for things?;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:39 PM;*To wait;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:39 PM;"Idk, that's literally all the RPGs for you";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:40 PM;"Okay, so I looked into it and I was right. Around Crystarium 7 is when they start asking several thousands of CP per upgrade, and then several tends of thousands. That's a pretty clear indicator of stop here, this is lategame grind territory";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:40 PM;"However, in Chip's defense here";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:40 PM;It's really not.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:40 PM;"I think it was crystarium 8, Rasea";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:40 PM;Giving the player options to change their equipment and stuff for different strategies throughout the game is something that good RPGs tend to so and not an unreasonable request;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:41 PM;Yeah was probably 8;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:41 PM;Which is the one you unlock after getting to pulse;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:41 PM;That's exactly what I'm asking for.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:41 PM;"```HP + 50 (740), Strength + 10 (740),  -Strength + 10 (740),   -HP + 50 (740), Auto-ability: Jeopardize (740), Strength + 8 (740), Magic + 4 (740), HP + 40 (2000)``` Crystarium 7";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:41 PM;It took me at least 10 hours just to get a few accesories upgraded to the point where they were showing considerable benefits.;;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:42 PM;"I'll admit, it's a bad 15 hours tutorial to get to the really good part";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:42 PM;"That's a really big jump in points, which should easily indicate to the player that you either have to grind a lot, or wait";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:42 PM;But it's not hard by any means to upgrade your stuff;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:42 PM;I think you just didn't understand how easy the upgrade system was;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:42 PM;....What on earth is your definition of hard then?;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:42 PM;"Put some organic materials, get to 3x XP";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:43 PM;Then use the other ones to fully upgrade your equipment;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:43 PM;Cheap and painless;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:43 PM;Organic materials are cheap. But mechanical components are expensive.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:43 PM;There's a chart that tells you how much of each material you need if you want to min-max;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:43 PM;"If you're in a place like Sunleth Waterscape, you're basically told to sit down, and not bother with upgrades.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:44 PM;That's with pretty much the entire game up to Pulse;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:44 PM;Which. Is. Bad.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:44 PM;X barely forced you to grind or change your equipment tbh;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:45 PM;"But you could pursue items for the sphere grid, or weapon customization, or summon abilities.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:45 PM;"And it's not that bad, they're locking abilities meant to be used in the missions";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:45 PM;"The missions are the best and hardest part of the game, that's where you're intended to use them";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:45 PM;Being forced to do anything in an rpg is bad. It's anithetical to the nature of the genre.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:45 PM;Taking away player choice and agency sucks.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:45 PM;XIII doesn't force you to anything;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:46 PM;"Here's your level cap. Beat this boss with this specific set of abilities and stats. Do it any other way? Sure, if you want to endure 5 hours tedium.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:47 PM;"In fairness here, XIII is limiting pre-Gran Pulse. The directors have even said as much that XIII was designed to have you go along a linear path. Gran Pulse opens things up and gives you a lot of freedom, but before that is mostly a lot of story and combat. You're not meant to grind anything really";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:47 PM;Thats my entire point.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:47 PM;XIII is easy to get everything you want when the game is prepared to bestow that privelege on you.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;"I'm sorry, but I think you're being biased here.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;Otherwise you play by it's rules. It's like the most obnoxiously controlling DM.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;"FFX sort of acts the same way, it's not as intense. FFX forces specific playstyles until you get Rikku, who gives you the ability to steal and get items for armor and weapon upgrading. FFX International also offers the Expert Sphere Grid, which allows you to branch anyone off into anything, giving you total freedom";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;Biased how!;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;?;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;...what rules?;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:48 PM;Unless you want to stick with the same default paradigms;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:49 PM;"X makes up for the set rules with a greater enemy variety, and changing characters.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:49 PM;"You can change characters in XIII, but a bit late, unfortunately";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:49 PM;"And Chip is right, XIII is limiting. It doesn't force specific strategies, because if you're smart, you can save organic & mechanical components for upgrading specific weapons and accessories. It requires planning, which is totally reasonable. Hell, XII is 50% game 50% planning simulator";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:49 PM;"Paradigms would be a bit more interesting if so much focus wasn't put on the stagger bar. It's essentially always going to be in the player's best interest to focus on Ra-Ra-Com, then Com-Com-Rav, and only worry about buffs occasionaly.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:50 PM;"I don't mind that it's limiting, because I rarely branch out into different strategies";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:50 PM;"XIII is limiting, but if you don't know how to play the game you will have issues even before Pulse";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:50 PM;"And if you don't mind waiting until Gran Pulse, then everything opens up then and you can go crazy with grinding if you so wish for alternate strategies and such";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:50 PM;"My problem again though, is that I don't want to be forced to just focus on maybe one or two weapons and accessories. I want as many abilities and strategies at my fingertips as possible.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:50 PM;"That's what made VII, X, and X_2 so fun for me.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:51 PM;You have all that;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:51 PM;"But they're locked before a certain point of the game, which isn't completely unreasonable";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:51 PM;It's utterly unreasonable. : / It's railroading me to play the game a certain way.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:52 PM;After getting to Pulse? No way.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:52 PM;You keep saying that like that's a reasonable amount of time to wait....15-25 hours in.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:53 PM;"I can't speak for VII, but X and X-2 don't just give them to you either. Having played both X and X-2 extensively, I know for a *fact* that it asks you grind. FFX asks that you spend a lot of time stealing from enemies or farming gil to bribe them in order to customize weapons & armor. Sphere grid levels are also a precious commodity before Sin/Omega Ruins, so you have to stick to a path (that you're allowed to choose). You are periodically given some freedom with the various friend/return/magic/ability spheres";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:53 PM;X only opens up early if you do a shit ton of grinding;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:53 PM;X-2 asks that you make yourself overpowered (forced EXP gain) in order to farm AP for character abilities if you want variance in dresspheres;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:53 PM;By shit ton I mean dozens of hours;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:53 PM;FFX opens the sphere grid for experimenting at around the 10 hour mark at the latest.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:54 PM;And the customization equipment far sooner. Plus it throws a bunch of weapon/armor at you anyways.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:54 PM;"Theoretically, because no one in their sane mind would try to min max It early";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:54 PM;"It gives you the *option*, but you have to grind for that option";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:54 PM;It takes an obscene amount of stealing and bribing to get decent abilities on your weapons and armor;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:54 PM;Fine. Then let me spend that time stealing. It's worth the time.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:54 PM;"It does allow customisation early, but I never did that, and never felt like I ever did";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:55 PM;"Oh boy, you will spend 20 hours stealing for something you could get in a few minutes later on";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:55 PM;I've never had that problem.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:55 PM;So you love grinding;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;I hate grinding;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;"Yes. v_v; Its an RPG thing.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;🤔 FFX doesn't work that way;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;"Enemies have a common & rare steal, both of which are fairly easy to get. You can even customize an ability that lets you only get rare steals";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;"Nah, I was mostly being ridiculous";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;It's not like XII's fucking annoying system;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:56 PM;Where that is definitely true;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:57 PM;It comes down to feeling like there's substance to my grinding.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:57 PM;Nothing in XIII before pulse feels substantial. It feels like one big plateau.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:57 PM;Can't argue with that;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:58 PM;"You can grind before Pulse, but Pulse gives you options that are 10x better and faster than anything before it";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 09:58 PM;"Which is the point, but I understand why people would take issue with that";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 09:58 PM;"By the time I get to gran pulse, I'm general sick of the game.";;

ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:01 PM;FFX-2s alchemist was amazing.;;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:04 PM;"I'm a completionist, and using rare items just ticks me off";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:04 PM;"Ah okay, understandable then";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:04 PM;A dollar unspent might as well not be a dollar.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:04 PM;"Well, to be fair";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;"Some items were meant to be used, like the throwables in III and IV";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;"Most games give you more than 1 of a rare item. Usually 5-7. So you can stand to use a few. And in FFX's case, you don't use rare items on anything but weapon & armor modification";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;"Which is fine, because you could buy them";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;But 98% of the items in FFX aren't rare. They can be stolen/bribed indefinitely;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;So not spamming blind/silence bombs or Al Bhed Potions is kinda weird;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;"Yeah, but still";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;"_is expressing himself a lot in Stardew Valley. Once he gets a stock of ten or more of a product, he gets to sell or gift everything else._";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;You didn't have a good idea on what you were doing when mixing;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:05 PM;Spend feelings gooooood;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;Al Bhed potions were nice;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;You could buy them;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;You....baught them?;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;I never had less than 50 Al Bhed potions at any time.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;...I think so? I remember you could buy from Rin;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;They eventually became buyable. Though I stocked up from machines in advance;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;Because they're fucking amazing;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:06 PM;Yes.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:08 PM;"I guess I am biased: Between level/stats just handed over because I killed so many enemies I was going to kill one way or the other, or being given equipment I had to track down or craft, or both, I'll take the latter.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:08 PM;So XIII just feels...frustrating.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:08 PM;"And while mix is really vague if you're playing blind, you can easily look up lists. Barring that, there are also various guides that tell you what's a good idea to mix, not mix and to save for boss fights";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:09 PM;save;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:09 PM;See;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:09 PM;"And often, if you're mixing items that are scarce (which are only scarce at that point in the game), chances are you have 8-10 of them. You stand to lose 1-2";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:09 PM;"Yeah, I hate that";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:09 PM;"Well, if you rarely come across an item, it stands to reason that it's rare and thus should be saved o.o";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:09 PM;That's just standard RPG logic;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:10 PM;It's a bit hard to tell if you're indeed rare or not though;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:10 PM;"Mmm, but then you have games (rarely) like how FFVII: New Threat rewards the gamble. And that mod has some potent items";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:10 PM;....Though some of them I don't quite understand.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;"I still don't get what the hell HeroPotion+ does in that mod, besides slam you with status effects....";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;*HeroDrink;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;"Quantity is usually a pretty good indicator, but fair enough";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;"That's a mod, we don't put mods into account here";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;"Still, you can satisfy your completionist as long as you have 1 of every item";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;Which is pretty easy;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;Most mods really tend to balance the game;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:11 PM;Ehhhh;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:12 PM;I'm not satisfied to 1 because it could be useful later on;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:12 PM;~~usually it is useful but I still do my best to not use it~~;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:12 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:12 PM;Rarely is it the case :P;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:13 PM;I don't understand completitionism.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:13 PM;"For example, during my X playthrough I used a megaelixir/megaphoenix only once";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:13 PM;"Whats the point of having something if you'll never use it. x_x;";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:13 PM;I have a similar head scratch over collecting figurines. I always forget I have them after a while.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:13 PM;It's an OCD thing Chip :P;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:14 PM;It's a... weird compulsion that's hard to fight;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:14 PM;"I run into the same issue with money. In games, that is. I often have a decent amount of money left over when shopping, but I don't spend it because I'm like but what if the next shop has some really good stuff?!";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:14 PM;Said the girl who used to fight with the RNG to get rare weapons from rare enemies in XII;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:14 PM;"And most of the time, it doesn't";;

ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;Y....you can always grind more though.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;Not always;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;I apparently am a power gamer.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;Some items are limited;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;I prefer not to if I can help it;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;Some are **very** limited;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;I also prefer not grinding;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;"If I'm not one-shotting every enemy before I leave an area, I'm not satisfied. There must be blood splattered on the walls before I depart.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;Grinding absolutely sucks;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:15 PM;"I am the very opposite of a power gamer. I don't like having powerful abilities and weapons when going through the story of something. I like challenge, so superboosting my equipment and characters ruins that for me";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;"However, once I reach postgame, I'm fine with grinding";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;I spent 110 hours platting XIII. 130 hours to almost plat FFX;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;Power leveling just makes it easier for you to not understand how a game works;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;"105 hours to plat Disgaea 5, and the Disgaea series is fucking predicated on being a grindfest";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;You still have to understand how the game works to get to those higher levels.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;"Nah, not really";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;It's not like I'm sitting in Besaid lagoon killing pirahna's the whole time.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:16 PM;.....My friend did that. She's worse than me.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;That is;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;Extreme;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;There's always a bigger fish.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;I'll go THROUGH an area at a normal place.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;I mean;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;They barely give any fuggin' sphere exp;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;How do you remain sane doing that;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;@_@;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;"But once I sense that I'm at the end, or if it's a second playthrough, I will power level.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:17 PM;If you power level through XII you end up breaking the game and making it easy to boring levels;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:18 PM;I won't touch XII anyways. I hate it.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:18 PM;I mean;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:18 PM;XII is easy without power leveling;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:18 PM;That's the point;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:18 PM;XII gives me the same sinking feeling of dulness as RTS games.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:19 PM;Well... Your loss.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:19 PM;That's...not a mature or friendly way to respond.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:19 PM;Lmao;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:19 PM;You can like something and not make a waspish remark when someone else doesn't.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:20 PM;I can assure you there's no more mature or friendly way to respond.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:20 PM;"You're missing out on a great game, that's all.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:20 PM;"I don't understand why you find RTS games dull? o.o They're really fun and, well, tactical. Especially stuff like TRPGs. Different genre, but relatively same concept";;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:21 PM;I can tell it's mostly bias.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:21 PM;I inherently don't enjoy JRPGs;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:21 PM;Yet I'm playing FF;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:22 PM;I don't judge a genre;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:22 PM;You keep bringing up bias.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:22 PM;"I don't like having to step back from a game and look at it through a microscope. I want to be in the thick of it, and feel the impact.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:23 PM;> XII gives me **the same sinking feeling of dulness as RTS games.**;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:23 PM;That's bias too.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:23 PM;"Oh hush. Everything is bias. We're human, we have individual tastes.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:23 PM;My bias is telling me I need to eat;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:23 PM;I'm hungry;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:24 PM;Go eat then.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:24 PM;"Anyways. I refer to XII like an RTS, because the game doesn't really feel like it has a lot of kinetic energy to it.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:25 PM;"You set the characters in motion, and unless a spell gets involved, they kind of just chug along like little wind-up toys. Everything has to be scaled down in presentation so the PS2 doesn't have a hemorage trying to manage all the graphics and a constantly active battle system.";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:26 PM;It's not really stimulating to watch.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:26 PM;"And the few times it does have moments where I want to fist pump....it's the summons and quickenings, of which there are too few in number, and happen infrequently for my tastes.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:27 PM;nothing about the way XII worked as a game had anything to do with the PS2 other than the magic system (could only queue up one at a time);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:28 PM;but it is true that the game requires very little effort to play overall thanks to gambits removing a large chunk of the decision making;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:28 PM;then add on to IZJS and TZA's changes you're pretty much playing for the plot;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:29 PM;"...in all fairness, gambits themselves are the decision making";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:29 PM;"Flimsy little projectiles, an entertaining spell does not make.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:29 PM;who cares about it being entertaining;;

ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;Me!;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;it's a game;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;XV is the game for you then;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;"What am I supposed to play the game according to what OTHER people like? o.O;";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;"Okay, I want to clarify a couple of things here";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;So you play games to look at the effects work?;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:30 PM;"Firstly, RTS games are not XII. XII is very automated, but you can choose to ignore gambits to make it not automated. RTS games have a lot of kinetic energy and you have a lot of interaction and choice with everything that happens. XII si __not__ that";;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;I play games that make me feel engaged with what's going on on the screen.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;"Secondly, Chip's stance makes sense. A key part of a lot of RPGs in the past 10 years has been having **some** level of visual spectacle";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;Limit breaks are FF's thing;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;Mystic Artes in the Tales series;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;Sometimes even just super strong spells;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;Summons as well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;those things don't define FF nor Tales;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;They don't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;FF was known for looking good sure;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:31 PM;FFX was a high point for me. The way the final blows just felt BAMF.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:32 PM;"But they are a consistent, ever present mechanic and system in the series";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:32 PM;"Play XV then ;)";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:32 PM;FFX is amazing;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:32 PM;Buy me a ps4 and I will. : /;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:32 PM;"You have a plethora of summons you can call at any time. Overdrives are basically limit breaks. Summons have their own limit breaks, which are all full of spectacle";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:32 PM;X-2 has the special dresspheres;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:33 PM;Even just basic spells just felt...powerful.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:33 PM;"XII, by comparison, rarely ever uses espers at all because basic combat far exceeds their efficiency and use";;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:33 PM;...you can adjust the camera distance;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:33 PM;XV has *some* spectacle. But summons are really rare in that game and magic sucks in it;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:33 PM;You have to keep an eye on what's going on around you.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:33 PM;Any spectacle is very specific sequences or cutscenes;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:34 PM;"Such as the Titan, Leviathan and Ifrit fights";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:34 PM;"XV is literally gimmick, the game since you're into that kind of thing";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:34 PM;Doesn't mean the game is amazing for the most people;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:34 PM;You only need one button to play XV;;

Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;"Additionally, spectacle serves an actual purpose beyond looking pretty for thumbnails and commercials: spectacle adds impact to your actions, making it __feel__ better to play";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;And feedback is a very important thing;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;Feedback is half the reason I love FFX;;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;Most of them are gimmick tbh;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;Feedback. That's the word I wanted.;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;I like feedback.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:35 PM;I hardly feel like it was something the game specifically did and more part of the game's overall presentation;;
Emiruko#0314;24-Aug-18 10:36 PM;If you have too much spectacle attacks take forever;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:36 PM;True;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:38 PM;that is a very true statement;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:38 PM;"And the longest animations I've ever seen would be some of FFXV's techniques and the summons.

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:39 PM;Fortunately you can tweak it in the PC version;;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:40 PM;Let's be honest here;;
ChipNoir#3597;24-Aug-18 10:40 PM;"I've only dabbled in XV for a little bit. My main impression tends to be Where the fuck did that thing come form, and how do I pry it's jaws off my ass?";;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:40 PM;Summons and magic in XV were only there because they have been a staple since FF III;;
Deleted User#0000;24-Aug-18 10:40 PM;Ye;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:40 PM;"And FF is ripe with broken ass summons, so it's not like Ramah coming in and obliterating a field of enemies is anything new";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-18 10:40 PM;But it almost feels like they weren't intented to be in XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:41 PM;Yeah but he comes in and ends every fight immediately;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:41 PM;I don't remember this ever happening in the past;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Aug-18 10:42 PM;plus it wasn't 100% either;;

Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:51 PM;I think I used magic... three times in the whole story?;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:51 PM;And one of them was the tutorial;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:53 PM;Though I don't really know a way in which that system works out;;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:53 PM;"Even with the novelty of added effects, it would be tedious";;
Rasea#1840;24-Aug-18 10:53 PM;"Either the game is easy enough that you don't need it, and thus is a redundant system. Or the game is difficult enough that you *do* need it, which means you have to spend gil or time on magic ingredients";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 02:57 AM;"So I'm deciding to finally commit to play FFVII and see ~~why it's so overrated~~ if I enjoy it or not and such. So, a question: are the speed of Tifa's reels affected by anything? The spinning, I mean. Battle speed or battle message options?";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 03:01 AM;"@Rasea#1840 not that I know. Unfortunately they didn't fix the menu framerate, so it's pretty bad on the PS4 version";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 03:01 AM;Ah okay;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 03:01 AM;Just seems oddly unnaturally fast or something;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 03:02 AM;It's because the reels run at a low fps so they don't seem smooth. They used to run at 60fps on the PS1;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Aug-18 03:35 PM;It sounds like they have more HP than you realize;;
Baguette Cat#6233;25-Aug-18 03:36 PM;The monsters in the battle square have a lot more hp than their savage versions;;
FireProne#0537;25-Aug-18 03:40 PM;"Well one of them was this turtle looking thing, he has a knife and if he gets close to you you're pretty much dead, I used bahamut zero on him which was 7000 damage then phoenix with an added 1000 then I pretty much did over 11,000 damage on him and he didn't die. That's pretty ridiculous considering that wasn't even the 7th reel slot. It was like 5 or 6.";;
Emiruko#0314;25-Aug-18 03:41 PM;Tonberry's are always deceptively strong;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Aug-18 03:49 PM;"Yeah, simply being, you're facing enemies with a lot more HP, and you, in turn, should be dealing more than 1,000 damage";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Aug-18 03:50 PM;"I'd say you should be dealing between 5,000-6,000 damage per hit.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Aug-18 03:51 PM;"Maybe even the max of 9,999";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Aug-18 03:51 PM;but that might also be a bit overkill;;
FireProne#0537;25-Aug-18 04:11 PM;I'm only half way in the game I can't do that much damage unless I grind for a long time;;
FireProne#0537;25-Aug-18 04:12 PM;And people were able to get omnislash in disc 1 but I'm on disc 2 so I guess even tho there's a price drop the enemies will be much harder;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Aug-18 04:43 PM;Whats your level?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Aug-18 04:45 PM;You can get omnislash on disc one. But folks that do that tend to know the game really well. You referred to a tonberry as a turtle looking thing so I’m guessing you’re pretty new.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Aug-18 04:45 PM;"Don’t take offense to that, I’m not much more knowledgeable.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Aug-18 06:32 PM;"More importantly, learn Big Guard. Trivializes the game so it’s up to you.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Aug-18 06:33 PM;"... trivializes may be the wrong word, but it makes the game much easier.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Aug-18 06:34 PM;Level 49 should be pretty close. I’d say low 50s is fine. What weapon is cloud using? What are your other pieces of gear? Did you throw a bunch of Hp plus materia on him?;;
FireProne#0537;25-Aug-18 06:37 PM;"weapon- crystal sword, bought it from mideel, armor - aurora gauntlet I think it's called, it drains ice and accessory well I just had regular protect vest on him but for battlesquare I changed the accessory to ribbon.

Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:09 PM;"That I've encountered, anyways";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:09 PM;Yunalesca isn't that hard;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:09 PM;SF was way harder;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:09 PM;You're right;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;"Nah, the one where you literally could not lose was harder :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;I remember that;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;It's not as if Yunalesca literally causes a game over if you go into that fight blind because of her fight transition;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;I guess if you're prepared than its not that bad;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;Took me two tries I think;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;For most superbosses you'd go in prepared;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:10 PM;It's not that hard;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:11 PM;"Oh yeah, superbosses are going to wreck you even if prepared";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:11 PM;"It depends on the game and the superboss, of course";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:11 PM;"I'd say Ozma is one of the hardest? Never really fought it, but I heard some pretty scary stories";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:12 PM;"For example, something like Yiazmat isn't genuinely difficult. As the devs know that it's hard to make boss fights genuinely difficult without it being tedious or cheap. So they just made it a really long fight and you have to be careful not to screw up or you get to start over";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:13 PM;"I personally haven't made it to XII's superbosses or anything, but Seymour Flux & Yunalesca are far and away the most difficult bosses I've fought in any FF game thus far. And I've done I, IV, V, X, X-2, XIII trilogy and XV";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:13 PM;Most superbosses after VI seem cheap tbh;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:13 PM;X had some difficult bosses too;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:14 PM;The Weapons in VII toke some preparing;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:14 PM;But nothing that's really undoable;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:14 PM;"I also like X's the most because it's one of the few games where they go hey, difficulty isn't exclusive to postgame";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:14 PM;I thought the weapons were a bit cheap too;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:14 PM;Just with one or two bosses in X;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:15 PM;"And the issue with postgame bosses is that they're rarely genuinely difficult. They're usually pretty easy, or really cheap, or incredibly lengthy fights";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:15 PM;Or you grind the fuck out and then stomp their faces to the ground;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:15 PM;Not fun;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:15 PM;That too;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:15 PM;Which I do my best not to do because I like having some actual challenge;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:15 PM;Gilgamesh in XII is one of my favourite bosses in FF;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:16 PM;"It isn't as challenging as some other fights, but it's *fun* and you need to keep doing micro management";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:16 PM;Though X's Monster Arena can be genuinely difficult if you pace your leveling so that you're roughly on par with the monsters you fight;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:17 PM;"Yeah, but there's not really a way to know *where* you are";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:17 PM;"By contrast, X-2's arena pisses me off";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:18 PM;And by that point you might have already done a lot of grinding and acquired some Celestial weapons;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:18 PM;So X's postgame isn't quite balanced;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:18 PM;"Definitely not balanced, no :p";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:19 PM;The Celestial weapons are bullshit to get by the way;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:19 PM;"And there is a way, sort of. You can use stats as a landmark. Celestial weapons don't increase your stats or anything (since X doens't work that way), but it's mostly there so you can break the damage limit (which does increase your damage). I don't think not getting break damage limit is a good way to make it challenging";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Aug-18 09:19 PM;I've talked bout this before;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:19 PM;But you can pace your characters so you don't kill everything in five turns;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:20 PM;"Well, you can use the stats as a landmark... but is there anything there for you to compare with?";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:20 PM;"When I was working on platting, I actually used a Youtuber's 100% playthrough as a guide on stopping points to face the creations at a reasonable power level";;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:22 PM;Looks like a bit of work;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:22 PM;That's why I really enjoyed the 64 missions in XIII;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:22 PM;It was more like setup over stats;;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:22 PM;"It is a bit of work, but it's fun :p";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:23 PM;"And yeah, they were. I enjoyed XIII's mark thingy";;
Rasea#1840;25-Aug-18 09:23 PM;Though a few of them wanted to make me kill kittens;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 09:24 PM;"I wish I had played the other FFs before, because the 3x Tonberry didn't scare me at all lmao";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Aug-18 10:00 PM;those missions were also the most boring shit ever 90% of the time;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 10:00 PM;So I didn't have much interest in continuing it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Aug-18 10:00 PM;the gameplay is fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Aug-18 10:01 PM;it's just not all that great until you start doing the missions and stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Aug-18 10:01 PM;and then the story is another classic you'll never see this area again deal;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 10:01 PM;I see. I wasn't sold on the prologue;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Aug-18 10:02 PM;"in this situation CC's linearity is a big problem, bigger than XIII's";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Aug-18 10:02 PM;you pretty much walk through cutscene paths that's how closed off it is;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 10:03 PM;I'm fine with linearity;;
Marcello#4574;25-Aug-18 10:03 PM;"I've always enjoyed linear games, so if I want to play something more chill and simple I'd rather go with linear games";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Aug-18 09:58 AM;Yeah that’s not going to be enough for that part in my opinion. 7k HP is more where you need to be  Level up some HP plus materia and that should really help. Might also want to get a ziedrich for added protection.;;
FireProne#0537;26-Aug-18 10:24 AM;"Alright well might as well continue the story then, the only way to get that is if I steal it from Rude.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Aug-18 03:56 PM;Yeah there are a couple spots to pull a Ziedrich if I remember correctly.;;

Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:19 PM;"So i own FFX/X-2 HD, Type Zero, 15 and KH1.5+2.5HD on ps4 annd 13 + 13 2 on pc. which of these should i play first? I got some way into 15,  about 15 hours or so before i stopped.";;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:23 PM;"Type-0 has some issues in it. FFX is amazing and I highly recommend it. X-2 has plenty of issues, though the gameplay is fun enough. I imagine you have your own opinion of XV by this point. XIII is nice, depending on how much you can stand linearity., , The KH HD collection is amazing but my opinion of that is biased as I'm quite invested in the KH world. Disregarding that, KH1 and KH2 are fun ARPGs. Re:chain of memories has some issues and doesn't play at all like the mainline games. Birth By Sleep is also a bit different, but fun. And the only KH game with a playable character (except 358/2 Days)";;
Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:24 PM;i think where ive stopped in kh is before the second set of worlds. the gummi ship flying got a tad annoying;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:25 PM;"The gummi ship stuff in KH1 absolutely blows and I very much dislike dealing with it. You only have to do it once per trip to a new world, though. After that you can just shortcut there immediately";;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:25 PM;KH2's gummi ship stuff is amazing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:26 PM;"eh I wouldn't call it amazing when compared to actual shmups, it's still pretty lame but compared to KH1's version";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:26 PM;it's godlike;;
Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:26 PM;my ps4 is basically an RPG machine. since thats all the exclusives seem to be for ps;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:27 PM;"I don't really play them and given that it's very much not the focus of the game and more of a sidequest/minigame thing that has no bearing on your Sora adventures, it's pretty great";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:27 PM;god now I'm reminded that they'll probably be back in KH3;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:27 PM;It definitely is;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:27 PM;There's been brief clips of it;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:27 PM;And it looks *wonderful*;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:28 PM;"I was a huge fan of the gummi ship stuff in KH2. It was really fun and I liked being able to design my own various ships and do the various levels. I'm really excited to see what kind of new, interesting stuff they do with KH3's gummis";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:28 PM;"I'll believe when I see it, Square's ability to do anything right in this division has my expectation beyond the lowest point";;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:29 PM;"Fair enough, though they only really disappoint with FF. Everything else seems to do quite well";;
Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:29 PM;i want to try FFX but it seems like i should proaly finish KH1 at least efore i do that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:29 PM;FF and most of KH except for 1 and 2;;
Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:30 PM;KH got me really confused;;
Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:30 PM;"like theres all these games on other platforms. and some of them are card games, and theres a mobile game";;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:30 PM;"It does that. Beyond KH1, the lore gets really convoluted and the games are really spread out";;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:31 PM;"Also most of the side KH games are good ones. Re:chain of memories isn't bad, just different. Days definitely has some flaws, but it's a fun little game.

Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:31 PM;DDD is also nice;;
Weapon Marks#7892;26-Aug-18 08:31 PM;i know some of the games arennt on PS4 annd there just cutscenes;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:32 PM;"CoM should've been like Shadowverse or Hearthstone tbh, it's different but the changes are just not fun at all";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:33 PM;"BBS definitely doesn't do anything spectacular gameplay wise either, I'd give it a go because the story makes the most sense there";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:33 PM;making it a card game would've been better;;

Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:34 PM;"Yeeeeeah, I don't think leaving an installment of the KH series on an antiquated system is a good thing";;

Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:35 PM;And meh. Some people genuinely enjoy Re:CoM's gameplay;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:35 PM;"I didn't, personally, but I understand that it's unique and has some merit to it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:36 PM;the only thing I liked was the room system;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:37 PM;something I'd actually like to see in a separate game that is simple and consists of nothing but that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Aug-18 08:37 PM;but as far as other stuff go I just could not enjoy it;;
Rasea#1840;26-Aug-18 08:38 PM;And that's the beauty of the KH series. :p You have all kinds of different games that allow for experimentation and a wide range of people to be able to enjoy various parts to them;;

Weapon Marks#7892;27-Aug-18 08:53 AM;now on monstro;;
Rasea#1840;27-Aug-18 08:58 AM;"Going in order:, , Destiny Islands - messed around with your friends. Sora got approached by that shadowy hidden figure by the door. Then he got the Kingdom Key keyblade and had to fight off Heartless. Riku was tempted by the darkness and swallowed by it, Sora fought off that big ass shadow thing. Then he wound up in Traverse Town., , Traverse Town - he ran around trying to find his friends, only to find Pluto. Before this, Mickey left to fight the darkness on the other worlds. Goofy and Donald were sent to assist Sora in Traverse Town. You fight that big Iron Armor thing (though iirc you get some magic before that). Then you're sent off on the gummi ship., , Wonderland - you mess around with rooms of varying sizes, trying to rescue Alice from the evil queen, gathering evidence of her innocence/guilt. You also fight that big Trickster boss. You eventually succeed and leave., , Olympus Coliseum - you arrive and Phil mistakes you for Hercules and lets you compete in some of the games. Hades then gives you a pass to enter the tournament thingy, eventually fighting Cloud, who's working for Hades. Then a scene happens where Cerberus is let loose, Hercules holds it off for the time being. Then you rush back in to take Cerberus off Hercules's hands and defeat it.";;
Rasea#1840;27-Aug-18 08:58 AM;"Deep Jungle - your party argues over whether or not to land in Deep Jungle. The argument causes a crash, causing you to be split up from Donald and Goofy. You fight off that tiger thing. You meet Jane & Clayton and are reunited with Donald & Goofy. You collect some slides for Jane and Sora somehow recognizes one of them. Jane then offers to Sora to meet the gorillas, which you do. You're sent away afterwards. Then Clayton goes hunting for gorillas, almost shooting one of them before Donald intervenes., , Then the gorillas are attacked by heartless, being born out of Clayton's own darkness and anger. You have to go save them all (them giving you Gummi Blocks in return). After doing so, Sora's attacked by Sabor, then you go to save Jane & Terk who get abducted by heartless. Then you beat the Clayton-Stealth Sneak thingy and (iirc) get the Cure magic for doing so";;
Rasea#1840;27-Aug-18 09:04 AM;"Agrabah - mostly just going to the Cave of Wonders while Jafar is being an evil dick and Iago lying his butt off. Aladdin uses his first wish to get rid of a bunch of heartless. Then they chase after Jafar who's got Jasmine captive, Aladdin uses his second wish to save Jasmine, but Iago steals the lamp so Jasmine gets dropped in a pot that turns into the Pot Centipede. They chase after Jafar & Jasmine into the Cave of Wonders afterwards. You fight the tiger-head-face boss thing. You go to fight Jafar who's in league with Maleficent. Jafar makes the keyhole appear, you get into a boss fight where Jafar makes Genie fight alongside him against Sora. You beat him, but then Jafar turns into a Genie. You steal the lamp from Iago and rub it, trapping Jafar inside., , Then you seal the keyhole, go back to Agrabah where Aladdin uses his last wish, as promised, to set Genie free then joins you to help find Jasmine., , After which you end up doing Monstro";;

Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 01:14 AM;"FF7 question for anyone that's experienced with the early parts of the game. I'm on disc 1 and I've made it to Mt. Nibel., , How useful is magic in general? By which I mean a combination of summons, magic spells and enemy skills. I've gotten all the enemy skills you can get so far (the main damage ones being Matra Magic, Beta and Aqualung). Matra Magic is nice since it's non-elemental. But relying at all on magic seems to be a massive pain., , Using [spell]1 is very economical, but the damage seems to be lacking when everything has 500+ HP at this point in the game. [spell]2 is obviously better, roughly double the damage but a whopping 5.5x MP cost (4 MP vs 22 MP) seems insane. No idea why the MP costs are so crazy.";;

Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 11:22 AM;"@River#4775 My major criticism of Final Fantasy VI on Steam is the graphics are beyond ugly, and we have to pay $15.99 for a copy. I think it's a ridiculous price considering how little effort went into updating the graphics. At that point, I would have preferred the original art style, and then update the writing. As such, that's why I think the SNES/Wii Virtual Console version is the best version of the game.";;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 11:27 AM;"One change I like with the writing is that they changed Kefka's most powerful attack Goner to Forsaken. I think that's a better name than Goner, and it was like this because Nintendo of America thought that was religious reference, and religious references were always censored. Also, Fire 3 was renamed Firaga and Pearl was renamed Holy. I hated how Nintendo of America censored so much crap back in the day.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Aug-18 03:13 PM;"Hmm... I have only finished VI and VII and am on VIII now. I would say VI from my small sample size. Of the three I've played, VI seemed to get at the heart of FF gameplay and is one of the top FF games in general (so I hear).";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Aug-18 03:20 PM;It is also linear during the first part of the game which is helpful to get someone situated.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Aug-18 03:20 PM;Then it stops the handholding during the Floating Continent .;;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:30 PM;"Okay. I usually recommend Final Fantasy IV. The reason for this is because I feel that it is easy, has a story that is easy to follow, the story is engaging enough, and it teaches you the Active Time Battle system used in the next 5 games. It also has characters that are very likable. I honestly would recommend playing either the PSP version or the Steam version of IV, if you cannot get a hold of the PSP port. If you want a challenge, play the DS version (Hard difficulty of the Steam port), which is my favorite version of the game because of the writing of the dialogue, the voice acting direction (which I feel is good), and I personally like the sprite work. But beware, the DS version is really difficult. But I do know that there are people who don't like the DS version.";;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:37 PM;"Final Fantasy VI is not a bad place to start either. I would go from IV to VI, but I think because of the equipment setup and Esper customization, I can see how it could become cumbersome to track all of it and why I would pick IV to start over VI.

Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:12 PM;"Also, if you get the Steal materia, try fighting an Eligor enemy and steal a Striking Staff for Aeris. It is a strong weapon for her at that point in the game.";;

Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:14 PM;My top 5 are: 6>9>1>12>7;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:15 PM;"Most people don't put 1 near the top, but that game has a lot of sentimental value for me, and I love DnD so that's why it is high on my list.";;
Trebs#3423;31-Aug-18 04:15 PM;"I don't have a top 5 because despite playing nearly all of them, I have barely played any of them to completion. Only ones I've gotten close to are 6, 9, and 10.";;
Trebs#3423;31-Aug-18 04:16 PM;But this should probably go to #general;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:17 PM;"@Trebs#3423 One of my best friend's favorites is VII and he never completed that game. In fact, the farthest he gotten to was the Shinra building.";;
Emiruko#0314;31-Aug-18 04:17 PM;"12 is my favorite. Also really like Tactics, 9, and 10. And so far I'm enjoying 15, but I'm not very far, and I don't know where to place it yet";;
Trebs#3423;31-Aug-18 04:18 PM;Oh I forgot I beat 15.;;
Trebs#3423;31-Aug-18 04:18 PM;15 was a good time.;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:18 PM;@Emiruko#0314 I only excluded Tactics because it is a side game of Final Fantasy. Tactics is my 3rd favorite Final Fantasy game.;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:18 PM;12 is a very good game.;;
Emiruko#0314;31-Aug-18 04:19 PM;I need to play more of the older ones;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:19 PM;What older ones haven't you played?;;
Trebs#3423;31-Aug-18 04:19 PM;I jumped to #general btw;;
Trebs#3423;31-Aug-18 04:20 PM;cuz it's probably the proper place to do this discussion;;
Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 04:21 PM;No worries.;;

qlip#0001;31-Aug-18 05:11 PM;"How is final fantasy dimensions? I’m skeptical of it, seeing how it similar style sprites to those found in the ff 5 and 6 ports (that people hate) and the fact that it’s a mobile game.

Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 04:58 AM;👀;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:01 AM;👀;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:05 AM;"Okay so this is my own personal opinion on it based on how I feel games should naturally be from a progression sense., , I think that VII is designed quite weirdly and the way the materia is laid out throughout the game makes absolutely no sense at all. One of the bigger issues is that QoL materia tends to come waaaay too late. By which I mean stuff like the Mug upgrade on the Steal materia. Or the Master materia, Shield materia, etc. A lot of the potentially powerful stuff comes at a point where you're basically obliterating everything., , Instead, you should have the QoL materia come earlier so you can actually use it, and save the broken stuff for late in the game. VII also lacks anything terrifying enough that you would need to use powerful combinations of materia against, effectively making the OP materia useless";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:07 AM;"Not to mention that the limitation of materia slots and the absence of triple linked slots that would make for more fun gameplay. But then you could break it even harder. Yeah, that doesn't matter when the game is already incredibly easy to break anyways. So I could do stuff like All + Magic + MP Absorb. Or putting two magic materia with a single All without having to waste space just to get MT casts out of my spells";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:08 AM;The limitation of slots also hurts because it effectively causes a lot of materia to go unused because you're fighting for slot real estate which bugs me as well;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:12 AM;"Which is where I think FFX really shines. You get a lot of QoL skills relatively early that can benefit you throughout the game. None of them are broken, but they make for a less tedious play experience and more enjoyable as a whole., , Things like turning Kimahri into a tanky thief that's well rounded. Accessing Mug relatively early. Steal actually being useful. Yuna's Nul-element spells that she gets super early. Wakka's Blind/Silence abilities. Tidus's group Flee + Haste/Slow at the midway point. Auron's Power/Magic/PDef/MDef abilities. They're all useful and help combat increasingly difficult enemies";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:18 AM;"I do agree that the Materia system is flawed, but I'm not sure if you can break it that quickly and easily. Do notice that most of the previous FF games worked in a similar fashion, with abilities being limited to certain jobs/classes, and VII was the first game to start experimenting with new active abilities and distributing them to your liking, so I wouldn't say it's really that bad because you couldn't be even more OP";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:18 AM;> implying Mug was that useful in X if you didn't intend on using Mix very early;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:22 AM;"~~by the way, I think most of the times you could've summarised your text in a few lines instead of so many paragraphs lmao~~";;

Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:26 AM;"Also, Steal/Mug was godlike in X. Even if you didn't use Mix (which is silly), Use was an amazing command throughout the entire story";;

Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:27 AM;"I've never felt the need to use steal, unless I missed plenty of good items";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:27 AM;"I don't like Mix because it's trial and error involving your items, so it's pretty much a gamble unless you use a guide";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Sep-18 05:31 AM;"Look at the enemy data for FFX and FFXIII enemies in their respective Ultimanias, each enemy takes a third of a double-page";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Sep-18 05:31 AM;Some bosses take an entire double page;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:31 AM;It's the reason I grinded my Thief to JL. 61 in FF III for the Gungnir;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:32 AM;"I haven't read all the FFX guides, but the popular ones (from what I know, anyways), do a good job of listing what enemies are encountered, their stats and what they're weak to.

Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:34 AM;"A Youtuber I like (forget his name, I can look him up) did a 100% playthrough thing where, once you get Rikku (because every enemy pre-Rikku has like potion crap steals) lets you know if any enemy has any worthwhile steals";;

Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:35 AM;"Oh, it is. I agree. But if you're using it as a first time guide as you go through the game, it's pretty helpful";;

Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:37 AM;"Well, that's how convenient the videos are. :p It's a 100% walkthrough. So he plays through the entire story and all the sidequests, platting the game.

Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:38 AM;And I don't think a text guide for that reason exists anyways? You have to do a lot of cross checking;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Sep-18 05:38 AM;The fact you can screw yourself over is entirely the game's fault;;

Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:42 AM;"I mean, let's be real";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Sep-18 05:43 AM;17 years ago;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:43 AM;Though a big one would be Wakka's Stonetouch weapon that you can only buy at that machina operation thingy that makes upcoming enemies way less of a pain;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 05:45 AM;Which I think is pretty important because crap like the Mandragoras (think that's their name?) and other high health enemies are a real pain to kill because of their high health and that's also the area where Wakka begins to fall off for a bit so it lets him stay relevant;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:45 AM;Have I mentioned before how I hate the way X does the equipment and abilities?;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 05:45 AM;It's like a much more restricted materia system (if you don't count most offensive magic);;

Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:00 AM;"Limit breaks in VII are a bit annoying because of that, but most people don't mind it because there isn't a considerable impact.

Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:06 AM;"I've only read a bit into them, but from what I can tell, they're not really important. Even if it's RNG on whether or not you use them, they're more like a neat hidden mechanic rather than an integral part of gameplay";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:07 AM;"Whereas Trance is entirely different. While I still dislike how VII handles it, you can at least give yourself the option to wait on limit breaks through things like Mug (though you take forever to get it) or casting magic (which can be taxing on your MP or a crappy use of your turn)";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:07 AM;"Trance is forced and you get no choice. You can even end up entering it at the end of battle, wasting it completely";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:12 AM;"I think the trance meter doesn't carry over between battles? It's not that bad, I never thought about *not* having control about it";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:13 AM;Trance saved me when I was alone with a berserk Steiner on the final boss. I went into trance and started dealing a shitton of damage;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:19 AM;This sums it up pretty well;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/485770676406583296/unknown.png;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:19 AM;~~Also jfc Yuffie's Conformer is broken af why does this thing exist~~;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:21 AM;I think that's fair. The last item is irrelevant to me because I modded my game to double the all animations' speed;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:21 AM;~~I never used Yuffie~~ 👀;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:21 AM;HERESY;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:22 AM;>:;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:22 AM;I'm not usually a fan of experimenting stuff;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:22 AM;I've went through 90% of the game with Tifa & Yuffie in my party;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:22 AM;I pretty much rocked with Clod/Tifa/Barret;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:22 AM;🤢;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:22 AM;"Barret, ew";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:23 AM;"From a roleplay perspective, it's the team that makes the most sense";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:23 AM;True;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:23 AM;I suppose I just liked Barret because I could let him in the back row and he'd still do full damage;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:24 AM;~~Yuffie is superior in every way to Barret tho~~;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:24 AM;~~you sure you aren't just biased because you love Rikku?~~;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:24 AM;~~Yuffie and Rikku have nothing in common what are you talking about 👀 ~~;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:25 AM;~~they almost look the same what are you talking about~~;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:25 AM;~~not to mention they look more like thieves~~;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:25 AM;"But no, I'm not :P Barret's only strength over Yuffie is being tankier. Which isn't really needed when you have Tifa and Cloud. Yuffie is __always__ back row, whereas only some of Barret's weapons are back row compatible";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:26 AM;"Not to mention Barret's magic stat blows chunks, so you have to relegate Cloud as your healer. Tifa can as well, but her magic stat is also on the lower side";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:26 AM;And Yuffie's limits are among the best in the game;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:26 AM;Tifa was my healer;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:27 AM;"Not that it even mattered tbh, since you could assign materia to anyone and the inactive party members' levels scaled";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:27 AM;"By the way, why I don't hate trance: https://clips.twitch.tv/DelightfulProductiveClipzOSfrog";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:30 AM;"I used Aerith as my healer (until that thing happens) then used Yuffie since she has the highest magic stat out of anyone left with respectable health and dex. Tifa generally had support magic and support commands, like Manipulate/Sense/Steal. And Cloud was my main damage dealer, having some elemental spells and also physical attacks. Summons tended to be kind of random";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:31 AM;"I always ignored summons because of how long their animations take. KotR is absolutely ridiculous, I think it was around 2 minutes?";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:35 AM;Just timed it;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:35 AM;"1m18s, lmao";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:36 AM;Most animations are relatively quick and I tended to use them quite often throughout the game;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:36 AM;Also fighting Sephiroth. One Winged Angel OST is fuggin' 😩 👌;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:37 AM;"I like OWA, but I prefer Dancing Mad";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:38 AM;"It's a huge 17 minutes piece, so it really amazes me. One of Uematsu's inspirations was from a progressive rock group I love, so I could see where he was coming from";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:39 AM;Didn't know it was that long o.o;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:39 AM;"I mean, Dancing Mad plays during the entire tower section";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:39 AM;I'm still in the early bits of VI :P;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:40 AM;Have only heard it in the Kefka fights so far;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:40 AM;Oh? I thought you played it before;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:40 AM;And that one boss fight in Zozo that has it for some unknown reason;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:40 AM;I played it briefly on the SNES up to the point where you beat the Zozo area;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:40 AM;I see. You enjoying it? What's your opinion on the PC sprites?;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:41 AM;"Some people deem it unplayable, but I think it's an exaggeration";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:41 AM;"Also, say what you want about KotR, but Sephy's Super Nova animation takes forever";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:41 AM;Literally sitting through it right now;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:42 AM;Super Nova is incredible and an one time only thing though lmao;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:42 AM;"Aaaaand I wiped, fuck";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:43 AM;"Anyways, my opinion on VI is a bit of a hot take. As far as graphics go, anyways";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:43 AM;...Which I will explain once I go to the bathroom because mother nature is suddenly calling;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:43 AM;lmao RIP. ~~I survived Super Nova with 1HP~~ I beat the fight with 1HP;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:50 AM;"Wait, FFIX's battle gameplay is slow?";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:50 AM;"Okay, back";;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:50 AM;I never thought of it as slow;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:51 AM;Oh and I'm also a Trance Lover;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:51 AM;And to attempt to explain without it being a long-winded explanation: I dislike SNES games because they're very pixelated. I like smooth things. A big reason why I'm able to play VII is because I love the characters and the combat system works quite well and I love the customization through materia;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:51 AM;So I rather like VI's HD sprites;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:51 AM;"Wait, isn't 7 still pixelated tho";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:52 AM;"It is, but those parts help me deal with its ugly choppiness";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:52 AM;Though the battle sprites are perfectly fine;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:52 AM;I mean look at those arms and legs Hahaha;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:52 AM;The field sprites are.... eugh. But I learned to tolerate them;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:53 AM;What are sprites? My game vocab is weak;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:53 AM;The models for characters and stuff in 2D games;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:53 AM;^;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:53 AM;I mean;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:53 AM;"If you don't like pixelated things, buy a gaming PC \:P";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:54 AM;VII's field models are pretty terrible yeah. Glad I could play it modded;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:54 AM;Playing SNES games through an emulator is optimal because you can add some very nice filters;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:54 AM;The only reason I was able to play through the older FF games were because of Squeenix's remastering project;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:55 AM;"Eh, even SNES filters leave it to be very blegh";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:55 AM;The filters can make them look more closely to IV on PSP;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:55 AM;You just love your mods eh? @Marcello#4574;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:55 AM;"And the one FF game I did play pixelated (FFV, which didn't have a PC version at the time iirc), I did it on GBA which minimizes the pixelated look";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;@Izwar Vain#5689 of course I love mods. The ability to tweak games to your liking is amazing;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;What;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;"Not for me, at all. I tried filtering VI and it was a far cry from IV. And yes, I did it correctly";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;The GBA version is actually way pixelated;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;I love playing the older games generally more than the newer ones;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;"...wait, I'm not sure now";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:56 AM;But you can play it in a smol resolution :>;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:57 AM;"Oh, I see";;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:57 AM;Cuz I'm really into that classic turn-based;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:57 AM;Fair enough;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:57 AM;That is with exception to FFXII;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:57 AM;FFXII is bae;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:57 AM;"There's still plenty of turn based RPGs out there, but yeah. ARPGs tend to reach more people and be more enjoyable to more people";;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:58 AM;And also what Bienfu said about mods. Mods almost always improve your game considerably in some way;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:58 AM;"About ARPGs, I just found out Sora and I share the same birthday";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 06:58 AM;Which is the KH1 release date;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 06:58 AM;👀;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 06:59 AM;I've never liked the Kingdom Hearts franchise because its an ARPG;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:00 AM;Or maybe cuz I didn't grow up with it like I did with classic FF titles;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:00 AM;I'm 22 and played KH for the first time a few months ago;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:00 AM;Some friends of mine forced me to play it;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:01 AM;Also in Kingdom Hearts I tend to just smash buttons rather than actually knowing what I'm doing lol;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:01 AM;So I decided to give it a go and loved it. I was never much interested to play it only by myself tbh;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:02 AM;It was interesting playing it tho. But I don't get that feeling where I'm like I wanna play the game again;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:03 AM;"Cuz y'know, even if you play it again, there ain't much difference to your previous gameplays (or at least as far as I would imagine)";;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:03 AM;I could endlessly play KH2;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:03 AM;It never gets boring;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:03 AM;Especially if you add some challenges;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:04 AM;I think I've only played one KH tho;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:04 AM;So I'm not being very open lol;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:05 AM;Maybe you could give it another try? You can get all ~~the relevant ones~~ on PS4. And KH3 is coming in January;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:05 AM;Sadly I don't have a PS4;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:06 AM;"I CAN buy one, but having to also buy a display is a hassle so I'm too lazy to bother";;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Sep-18 07:06 AM;But KH3 does really seem interesting;;
Marcello#4574;02-Sep-18 07:06 AM;"Oh, RIP. I have a TV here, but I prefer using my PC's monitor";;
KaidenMelon#3452;02-Sep-18 08:09 AM;Is ff2 worth playing?;;
KaidenMelon#3452;02-Sep-18 08:09 AM;Its been somewhat mixed in recent years It seems kupo. I don't really know if I should get it.;;
Rasea#1840;02-Sep-18 08:11 AM;"It tends to be the most polarizing game in the series. The story is nice enough, but characters join and leave your party quite often which can become annoying. The real kicker is pretty much how stats work. That tends to be what divides opinions";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Sep-18 09:57 AM;most polarizing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Sep-18 09:57 AM;"Maybe of the older ones, yeah";;
Perrydice#9311;02-Sep-18 10:19 AM;"@KaidenMelon#3452 It's up to you. It does give some unique ideas about the battle. Also, considering that Final Fantasy II is a Famicom game, it's a really engaging plot for the time, so it should be noted how impressive that is.";;
Perrydice#9311;02-Sep-18 10:19 AM;I wouldn't say Final Fantasy II is polarizing. Majority of people have the same feelings about it.;;
pokemongenius#1474;02-Sep-18 10:43 AM;The mechanics are probably the highlight of that debate. Pretending they were designed better some ppl like the idea of a progression system over traditional leveling. Im in the latter group of liking a traditional leveling system however when done well (example The Alliance Alive) a progression system can feel rewarding and natural like any classic leveling system.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;02-Sep-18 11:04 AM;Seems like I could steamrole through it.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;02-Sep-18 11:04 AM;Yah I will probs give it a go;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;02-Sep-18 11:42 AM;you can give it a try;;

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:37 PM;"@FireProne#0537 That's how I felt. I hate the dungeons the most in FFII, and these trap rooms are the biggest reason why... plus, they just absolutely crank up the encounter rate in dungeons, especially in those trap door rooms.";;

FireProne#0537;04-Sep-18 12:23 AM;dawn of souls? I have that too but I decided to play the psp one;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 01:00 PM;"Yeah, Dawn of Souls. I'll replay Final Fantasy I on the GBA again, but I don't know about replaying Final Fantasy II. Despite it speeding the leveling up on the GBA compared to the original NES, I just didn't like the game overall.";;
FireProne#0537;04-Sep-18 04:28 PM;"So far I'm enjoying it, I don't really see why the game has a lot of hate. Sure it's very different but I can see how they improve from this one on to later games. It's the first one to introduce the chocobos although you can't keep them. Also the very first cid, as so I heard there are a lot of cids in the series for some reason. But I haven't completed the game yet so I can't say it's GREAT overall but so far I like it, I feel like people just abuse the stat system first time around but if you just actually hit the enemies and grind like you're suppose to it's not bad.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 04:45 PM;"It's a lot of good ideas, but I think it is not executed well. For example, there is no reason to ever use a rod when literally every other weapon is more powerful and is useful throughout the game. I mainly used swords, axes, bows, and spears. I absolutely hate the dungeons because they are way too big, has several trap doors that just messed with me, the main path to the end of the dungeons isn't clear, and the sections where it throws several doors at you at once. Only one door advances, the others are trap room doors, and that's really frustrating. And in those dungeons, they crank the encounter rate through the roof really high to where it's unbearable.";;
FireProne#0537;04-Sep-18 04:54 PM;"Yeah that's true, when I finished Kashuan's Keep I had no mp lol. I barely beat the fire boss forgot what he's called but yeah there was a room there that had treasure, and it was on the same floor as the boss I believe so not all the rooms are empty but yeah it's really pointless just to have them there. I think that's the only thing I dislike about the game so far and the fact that the characters and story are pretty jank, there's this one part that kind of triggered me but I don't want to say cus spoilers.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 05:20 PM;"Firion is the main protagonist with no real character development. Maria is basically the girl of the party, and Guy is the dumb strong guy, no pun intended.

It's just funny how you play a game and you form and shape your own opinion, and then find that someone on YouTube has made a video with the same opinions or a very close, similar opinion. I don't agree with him on the music, maybe except the Chocobo theme. I actually like the overall OST. It has some really good songs like the Wild Rose theme, Overworld theme, and the Mysidian Tower theme. The Mysidian Tower theme is my favorite track from Final Fantasy II.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 07:12 PM;I'm sure that there are YouTubers that have the same opinion as I do with Final Fantasy XIII.;;

Perrydice#9311;05-Sep-18 09:30 AM;"I prefer the overall writing of the DS version over the PSP. I think that the voice acting and the thoughts during the menus really add more depth. The PSP version, although a very good version of the game, is a repeat of the Japanese version with some updated writing because the original translation is not good. But the DS is a better translation. It flows better and feels like whoever did the writing knows how to effectively put words on paper and really convey the message the game is trying to tell.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Sep-18 12:00 PM;I think the VI tattoos will be one of Kefka on one arm and one of Terra on the other... kind of a light v. dark thing;;

Perrydice#9311;05-Sep-18 03:11 PM;@Illixir#6703 I'm just continuing your question from #general. Is this before or after Cecil became a paladin?;;

Perrydice#9311;05-Sep-18 04:07 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 I know. It's just so awesome. I had a Secret of Mana for a while, and a Mega Man for awhile before that, but when I saw this one, and it happened around the time I started another Final Fantasy VI quest, I just couldn't pass.";;

Expanding Storm III#7924;05-Sep-18 05:29 PM;Not all of us own a psp anymore;;

Perrydice#9311;09-Sep-18 12:56 PM;"In the original NES Final Fantasy, the Monk is called the Blackbelt. Also, a lot of the spells have different names, too. For example, Harm is now known as the Dia spell. Nuke is now known as Flare.";;

Expanding Storm III#7924;09-Sep-18 03:04 PM;Monks get black belts;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;09-Sep-18 03:04 PM;But what if the monk is a beginner and still gets the name blackbelt🤔;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Sep-18 03:51 PM;Thief doesn’t steal in FFI. That’s lame.;;
Perrydice#9311;09-Sep-18 03:57 PM;"Thief, although my favorite overall job class, is the worst character to start with in Final Fantasy...especially in the original because the luck stat is bugged. However, if you turn him to a ninja, he is a badass.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Sep-18 08:08 PM;It was a mobile purchase. Is what it is.;;

pokemongenius#1474;09-Sep-18 08:48 PM;Indeed;;
Perrydice#9311;09-Sep-18 10:47 PM;@Marcello#4574 The mobile version is based off the PSP version.;;
Perrydice#9311;09-Sep-18 10:48 PM;My personal favorite version is the PS1. I think that version has the best modern conveniences while keeping true to the original.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Sep-18 10:56 PM;So I should have gotten it on vita.;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:41 AM;"The only reason I prefer the PS1 over the GBA and PSP is these versions are really easy compared to the PS1. The PSP version dramatically decreased the random encounter rate. I think the fastest speedrun on it is in the single hours. On top of it, because there are Ethers and they are forgiving with the MP, it's not hard to get through the game.";;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 06:41 AM;"So, the PSP decreased the random encounter rate";;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 06:41 AM;That's awesome;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 06:42 AM;Because the game being easier with less encounters means less grinding;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 06:42 AM;I finished the game without grinding;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:46 AM;"I finished Final Fantasy IV on the SNES with no grinding either, because the game is easy as fuck.";;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 06:47 AM;"Same, but for the PSP version. I did have to grind a bit for the final boss though";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:48 AM;The final boss wasn't hard. He just didn't go down in one or two turns.;;

Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 10:51 AM;Emulators exist 👀;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 10:54 AM;"I generally don't like emulating games as my preferred way of playing video games, but there are exceptions. I used to emulate Earthbound because I am not paying $150+ for a game, but now I can play it on the SNES classic. I emulated Mega Man X2 because I don't want to pay close to $100 for a SNES cartridge. I still emulate Terranigma and Final Fantasy V (SNES) because it never came out in the States. Other than a few others, I try to play how it was originally packaged to me.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 10:54 AM;The one thing I do like about emulation is that it preserves the video games history.;;
Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 10:55 AM;Why don't you like emulating them?;;
Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 10:55 AM;"And yeah, so many people don't understand that";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 10:55 AM;"I just prefer to play the original, how it was packaged to me.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 10:56 AM;"But emulation, because of the ability to save state, does help me practice on things that require precise inputs. For example, I practiced the 100 Super Jumps on a boss enemy in Super Mario RPG because it was the best way to practice on him, especially if I decided to speedrun the game. Most I ever got was 67.";;

Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 10:59 AM;"I'm not against save stating in general. I don't care what anyone does when they game, it's their game. But for me, I just don't like doing it most of the time";;

Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 10:59 AM;Agreed.;;
Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 10:59 AM;Such as FF12's treasures if you don't want to RNG manipulate;;

Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 11:50 AM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 A save file is like saving the game like normal. Save state is saving the exact screenshot you were on.

So you can save state cheese a lot of games to make it easier than playing the authentic thing... especially when it comes to RNG.";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 11:56 AM;Because the RNG Manipulation tool reads the memory;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 11:57 AM;It's cheating either way;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 11:57 AM;"If you know how RNG manipulation works, it is not cheating, in my opinion. It's similar to counting cards. It just makes you a better gamer, imho.";;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 11:57 AM;You're using external tools either way;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 11:57 AM;"The rng tool on Pc Doesn't alter the game, but reads the game";;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 11:57 AM;Same for the PS4 tool;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 11:58 AM;"In RNG manipulation, I am my understanding of the game's code to help me get the result I want. I would not consider that cheating because I am not using any cheat codes to change the code.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 11:58 AM;The PS4 tool doesn't read the games memory;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 11:58 AM;It only predicts its behaviour;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 11:58 AM;Not the same thing;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 11:58 AM;The difference is that the memory reading is done by yourself;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:00 PM;Whether it's cheating or not in a single-player game doesn't matter much;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:00 PM;"If someone does it, it's their choice";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:00 PM;They probably don't want to deal with *something* if they choose to cheat;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:00 PM;No matter the cheat;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 12:00 PM;I agree;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;"I generally don't. Especially in Final Fantasy games. The amount of effort to manipulate what you want doesn't outweigh the cost of time. Final Fantasy games are not super hard games, in general.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;Heck I was a big cheater back when I played competitive Pokémon;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;Just to make things faster to setup;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;So was I.;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;It definitely outweighs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;Unashamed;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;I spent 5 minutes to get the Seintegrat in XII;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;It usually takes so many hours if you do it legitimately;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;Also was a big RNG Manipulator 👀;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:01 PM;Yeah it definitely outweighs the time spent in most cases;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:02 PM;I glitched my Pokemon Red to give me Mew because I didn't have a Gameshark at the time.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:02 PM;"It's the more honorable of the two, anyway";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:02 PM;At least you're using the game itself 👀;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:03 PM;Speaking of Pokémon Red;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:03 PM;The first generation is such a glitch fest it's funny;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:03 PM;Hell yeah it is. It's full of bugs and glitches.;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:03 PM;Final Fantasy on the NES is full of bugs.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:03 PM;Oh yeah;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:03 PM;Things not working correctly;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:04 PM;Things not working *at all*;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:05 PM;"My friend was playing Final Fantasy on the NES for the first time, and he did Fighter, Blackbelt, White Mage, Black Mage, and I had to tell him some stuff to help him with the game.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:05 PM;"If you know majority of the bugs in Final Fantasy, the game isn't super hard.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:07 PM;"It isn't easy because of the sudden difficulty spikes such as the Marsh Cave. If you're not prepared for the dungeon, that place will kick your ass. Thank you, Peninsula of Power! Also, the Ice Cave kicks your ass too... Damn you, Cockatrices!";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:07 PM;"In my last playthrough, I felt the early game was grindy, but the latter half paced you pretty well, for the most part.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Sep-18 12:10 PM;Yeah if you know the bugs you can go around them...;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:12 PM;"In all fairness, I was underleveled when I went to the Ice Cave.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:12 PM;I was only at like level 15 or 16.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 12:23 PM;any bugs I need to be aware of? I am on the mobile version. Team is warrior/monk/wm/bm;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 12:36 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 A lot of the bugs that appear in the original are fixed in the mobile version. I think the Peninsula of Power still exists, though. Do you know about that bug?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:07 PM;No;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:07 PM;I dont know about many of the original bugs eithrer;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:07 PM;* either;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:08 PM;This is side-tracking me from VIII. You'll probably beat VIII before I do @Perrydice#9311;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 01:09 PM;"There's a section northeast from Pravoka that you can face enemies intended for way latter in the game. However, a well placed Dia or Diara spell, plus Fira on the Zombulls can kill them. If you defeat them, you get a shit ton of money and exp. points.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 01:09 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Lol. I actually am playing Tactics as a side tracking to Final Fantasy VII. Just FYI, Final Fantasy I is not that long of a game. It probably will take about 6-10 hours, if that.";;
Brion#4623;10-Sep-18 01:13 PM;"that peninsula was amazing. i could only handled 3-5 battles before heading back to town, but it saved a lot of grinding time";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 01:14 PM;"Hell yeah, it does.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 01:17 PM;"@Brion#4623 In the original, I would either grind Ogres or grind Kyzokus (which I find funny because you fight Pirate and Kyzoku, and Kyzoku is Japanese for pirate) until I get to level 5. Once I get enough cash for a Fir2 spell (known as Fira now), I would buy a few tents to save near the peninsula. Once completed, I would keep resetting until I got 4 Zombulls. They give you like 1000 exp points and like 4000 gil if you win. That is a lot at this point in the game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:21 PM;I just got to the first dungeon where I'm supposed to track down this Garnett dude and I think I'm already level 4... I was leveling up after only 1-2 random encounters.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:22 PM;"damn, only 10 hours? That is a pretty short game. Probably good then as I clearly have trouble with the longer games, ha.";;
Brion#4623;10-Sep-18 01:24 PM;"@Perrydice#9311 i just did my first playthrough of FF1 (NES) a few weeks ago so i really was just winging it, and was told about that peninsula while grinding around the elf town";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 01:28 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 I have my playthrough of Final Fantasy on the GBA on my YouTube channel. I only need to do the last orb and the final dungeon and I am at 6 hours into the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:29 PM;Oh wow... my first playthrough and I'm pretty much blind so it might take me a while.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:29 PM;I still just don't understand why FF games need to be obtuse at times when it comes to where to go next.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:30 PM;"VIII has been linear up to now which has been good. When it opens up, I'm sure I'll be lost.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:31 PM;"At least VII only had one point where didn't know where to go next. VI was a complete disaster for me when I got to WoR. If I didn't have a guide, I'm not sure I would have figure out what the hell to do.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;10-Sep-18 01:31 PM;It opens up pretty soon tho;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 01:31 PM;"They really strongly want you to talk to NPCs. If you talk to them, they have a decent idea of telling you where to go. I will give you this. Final Fantasy is one of the more non-linear games in the series.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;10-Sep-18 01:33 PM;I actually really loved the WoR part in VI;;
Izwar Vain#5689;10-Sep-18 01:34 PM;"It's really not that open, at least in the very beginning";;
Izwar Vain#5689;10-Sep-18 01:34 PM;But it would be quite tough to find all characters on your own but not impossible;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 01:35 PM;VI is one of my favorite games of all time. So I loved WoR as well once I got my bearings.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:13 PM;"yeah, i hear you @Izwar Vain#5689. It isn't open in the beginning but that ends pretty quickly. I'm also very new to JRPGs so it's pretty foreign to me.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:14 PM;"I'm American... turn-based combat? GTFO, AMERICANS DON'T WAIT FOR SHIT! We literally shoot first and don't even bother with questions later.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:14 PM;I say that in a self-deprecating manner of course.;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:14 PM;"I'm American, too. And you're right. Americans are so impatient, they automatically want instant gratification, and they want it now.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:15 PM;"Yeah, i was almost expecting some quest markers or something... nope";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:15 PM;"expecting, read: hoping for haha";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:20 PM;"The Final Fantasy franchise took off a little with Final Fantasy on the NES, but it didn't go mainstream until Final Fantasy VII, where it won a lot of American gamers. As far as gameplay goes, the one thing I think is a step-down from Final Fantasy VI is the equipment setup. In VII, it's just one weapon, one armor, and one accessory. And with the exception of materia growth, you generally go with the stronger weapon almost every time. Whereas with Final Fantasy VI, you went by what elemental damage your weapons did, and it wasn't always the strongest weapon.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:21 PM;"Yeah, I felt that as well. To be honest, after all the characters and equipment in VI, I was happy that VII streamlined that a bit if only to give my head a break.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:21 PM;That's fair.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:21 PM;I was overwhelmed with all of the characters and customization in VI;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:22 PM;and not in a bad way necessarily;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:22 PM;But it was good to have a little break from it. Now playing VIII I think I am appreciating it a lot because gear is basically irrelevant (at least in the early game for me);;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:23 PM;"Yeah, but what helped me was keeping certain characters in the roles that suited them best. I didn't make Cyan into a strong magic user because he fits best as a warrior doing physical damage. Same with Locke. I made Celes, Relm, and Terra mainly work on magic because they are best in those roles.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:24 PM;"For sure, I think that's the only way to play without going utterly insane";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:24 PM;You can if you want but it takes too long with not a lot of reward.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:25 PM;"And endgame in VI is pretty much all about the mages. Relm, Celes, Terra, and Locke were my A-team for the final dungeon(s)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 02:25 PM;Locke obviously isn't much of a mage but he's my favorite character so he had to be involved;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:26 PM;You mix his Valiant Knife with the Offering and he is a beast.;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 02:26 PM;"If you mix the Gem Box with Terra's morph, she kicks everyone's ass with her strong magic power.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;10-Sep-18 02:31 PM;Valiant knife is def his best dagger;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;10-Sep-18 02:32 PM;Been hitting up to 9999 with that;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;10-Sep-18 02:32 PM;Gave him the master scroll;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;10-Sep-18 02:32 PM;4 times;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 03:56 PM;what's the master scroll? I was on SNES version;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 03:57 PM;is that the same thing as the Offering?;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 03:59 PM;"Yes. It's called the Master Scroll in modern remakes, but it's known as the Offering in the original SNES.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 04:00 PM;Got it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 04:00 PM;"When I was playing through VI the first time, I definitely got completely confused by the different naming conventions";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:04 PM;"Nintendo of America, at the time (I don't know about now), had strict censorship policies, so all swear words were translated as something else and all religious references were removed. For example, the Holy spell is called Pearl in FFVI. Also, Celes says that she is going to take a leap of faith when jumping off the cliff instead of saying she is killing herself. I think the Master Scroll may have been a religious reference so they changed it to Offering. Also, Goner in the SNES version is called Forsaken in the remakes (which I think Forsaken is a better name) because of the religious reference.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:09 PM;Wow. I had no idea about those censorship policies;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:11 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 In the NA SNES version of Final Fantasy IV, they called the Holy spell White. Also, after you become a Paladin, the Mysidians tell you that they are going to wish for your power and strength instead of pray.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:12 PM;Ahh I see. I wasn’t aware of these changes when I first played IV;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:13 PM;Did you play the Japanese version first?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Sep-18 04:22 PM;"Wow, that's pretty crazy.";;
pokemongenius#1474;10-Sep-18 04:32 PM;FF6 had some naughty sprites too;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:33 PM;"Such as the Siren sprite. In the Japanese version of VI, it shows her bare ass.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:38 PM;I played the Japanese version with English translations;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:45 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 Oh okay. Yeah the Japanese version is way better than the NA SNES version of FFIV. It's the most butchered game in the series, imho.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:45 PM;I agree! Plus there are more jobs too ^^;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:45 PM;@Perrydice#9311;;
Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 04:47 PM;More jobs? But IV and VI (no idea which one you are referring to) have forced jobs;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:48 PM;I was referring to the Japanese version of iv;;
Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 04:49 PM;🤔 How does that work;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:52 PM;"I wasn't aware that you can change jobs in Final Fantasy IV. I thought they were all fixed except for Cecil, who goes from a Dark Knight into a Paladin.";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Sep-18 04:56 PM;IV has forced jobs;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 04:56 PM;I think you meant party changing?;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 04:56 PM;But I think the NA release had a few things that were removed such as spells;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 04:56 PM;You can change your party in PSP IV;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 04:57 PM;"Yeah, but even so, my final party is still Kain, Cecil, Rydia, Rosa, and Edge.";;

Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 05:03 PM;Honestly;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 05:03 PM;IV to VI all had consistent characters;;

Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 05:07 PM;Im loving this game;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;10-Sep-18 05:07 PM;That’s good;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:24 PM;"My problem with Edge is that he is introduced way late in the game, he's an asshole, hits on Rosa and Rydia (a young girl) like all the time, and then they expect me to feel sorry for him about his parents. But thay spoon damage... lol. If he was introduced earlier into the game, I may have liked him a little better but because he is introduced at like 65% into the game, I just don't care about him. At least I can relate to Edward on some levels, even though he is a spoony bard. I can understand him crying after seeing the love of his life give up hers to save Edward's.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:27 PM;"@Marcello#4574 I like the cast of Final Fantasy V, too. If I had one criticism, it's they are all too alike. But I think Bartz, Faris, Lenna, and of course Gilgamesh are pretty memorable.";;
Rasea#1840;10-Sep-18 06:31 PM;FFV's best character was Faris's sea dragon thingy;;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:32 PM;Syldra?;;

Marcello#4574;10-Sep-18 06:34 PM;"Quite the opposite, actually";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:41 PM;"I think they are similar to each other. They're all not assholes. The men are typical men. All characters have good hearts, so they are likable from the get-go. Faris, imho, is the standout character. She has the best character development in the game... of course, Gilgamesh is just a silly character. I think Krile and Lenna are interchangeable.";;
Perrydice#9311;10-Sep-18 06:42 PM;"But nevertheless, it's just a minor nitpick. I like the cast overall.";;

Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:00 AM;I hope to make some progress with Final Fantasy VII this week. I haven't played it since I made it to Disc 2.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:04 AM;Time to strap on a snowboard very shortly after a tragic life event. Rock on.;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:19 AM;Woo hoo!;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:20 AM;I find it funny sometimes how cold some of these characters can be in these Final Fantasy games dealing with the death of someone.;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:21 AM;The real question is: did you forget to unequip their equipment and/or accessories before they kicked the bucket?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:21 AM;I feel like jrpgs run rampant with different forms of nihilism;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:21 AM;From what I’ve played/watched;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:21 AM;Ha. I did not unequip.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:21 AM;I also forgot to equip in VI before final battle.;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:22 AM;I made sure before the last fight with Aeris that I unequipped her accessory and equipped her with a weaker armor so I can keep some of the equipment. It really doesn't matter what weapon she has on because she is the only character that can use it.;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:23 AM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 In my final battle against Kefka, I had to carefully make sure that all my equipment was good to go before I took him on.";;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:23 AM;Same with the Espers.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:25 AM;"I wanted to but the final battle snuck up on me before I could. Wasn’t aware that stepping on that stone would trigger it. Thought it would open doors, then I could equip and walk through. Oops.";;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:26 AM;"Oh yeah, was it your first playthrough?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:26 AM;Yeah.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:27 AM;I just started FF games a handful of months ago.;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:27 AM;"Makes sense. I did the same thing the first time I played it. Luckily, I saved it before I triggered the final battle, and since I knew what to expect, I worked on my equipment setup for a couple minutes and made sure I had it good to go.";;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:28 AM;"In my recent re-playthrough, since I have beaten it 5 times now, I knew what Espers to equip, such as the Golem, Fenrir, and the Palidor (or Bahamut).";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:29 AM;I actually still beat it first try. I was a little overleveled and had just enough good gear spread around.;;

Marcello#4574;11-Sep-18 11:38 AM;"@Perrydice#9311 no need for that, just use Mighty Guard";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 11:39 AM;Yeah. Or in VII use big guard and trivialize the game (outside of post-game content);;
Perrydice#9311;11-Sep-18 11:39 AM;@Marcello#4574 For Final Fantasy V? I did use Mighty Guard. That blue mage spell does wonders... even in Final Fantasy VII.;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 05:02 PM;@pink materia 🌸#2145 OpenEmu actually uses PPSSPP;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 05:02 PM;It uses modules for each emulator;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 05:02 PM;Same as RetroArch;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 05:03 PM;RetroArch is pretty neat because it has the PS3's XMB interface;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 05:11 PM;Drop that file in the `system` folder of RetroArch;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 05:12 PM;"Once you do that, go to the first tab";;

Izwar Vain#5689;12-Sep-18 08:09 PM;Windows.;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:09 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:09 PM;"What system(s), Fark?";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 08:11 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 RetroArch got you covered 90% of the times;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:35 PM;Uh. I don’t know. MacBook Air from 2017.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:35 PM;MacOS.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:35 PM;Boot Camp was suggested.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:36 PM;But my hard drive is too small to partition. 🙄;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 08:50 PM;"For now, until I make it happen, if I desparately want to play any PSP games, I'll work on trying to emulate.";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:50 PM;"No, I meant what systems are you looking to emulate :P";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:52 PM;Oh. Uh... all of them. What system was XII on?;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:52 PM;PS2;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:52 PM;Probably PS2 for X and XII;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:53 PM;"But the major ones are all available on Mac. PCSX2 (PS2), PPSSPP (PSP), Dolphin (Wii & Gamecube)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:53 PM;Interesting;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:53 PM;Dunno why you'd emulate X unless the subtle art changes bug you 🤔;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:53 PM;Just so I could have it on my computer. I travel a lot for work so portability and options are key.;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:54 PM;Ah okay;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:54 PM;I like the UI changes and crispiness of HD way too much. Plus it is on Steam;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:55 PM;I can’t really do much on console or desktop PC because of that travel. So my only real options are vita and laptop.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:55 PM;My PS4 basically collects dust at this point.;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:56 PM;I would assume that your Mac could run FFX HD though 🤔;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:56 PM;I have all these games on it that I purchased during some of their flash sales and I have yet to even open a lot of them.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 08:56 PM;Yeah. I think X is no problem. XII is another story but I’d like to see what happens.;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 08:58 PM;"Then HD it is :> And yeah, XII is best emulated if difficulty is a concern/you don't want to mess with mods";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:36 PM;I don’t want to mess with mods.;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 06:38 AM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Final Fantasy XII was on the PS2. It was on late in the PS2's production cycle. I think the PS3 came out like a year later after FFXII came out in '06.;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 06:48 AM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 @Rasea#1840 I don't think there's a reason to use mods for that. If you don't grind, don't do the trial mode and for some added challenge don't unlock the second board, then you have a more balanced game";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:02 AM;"Except for the part where it's stated that basically everything in the game got a stat reduction so it will be inherently easier. The least you can do is either use that story boss revamping mod to make them actually difficult (as people may only want bosses to be difficult, not standard enemies)";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:02 AM;Or the other big revamping one;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:04 AM;> so it will be inherently easier;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:04 AM;You mean harder?;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:04 AM;I'm just saying handicapping yourself is a viable workaround;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:05 AM;"Not too easy, not too hard";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:07 AM;"No, I mean if you play TZA, then you will inherently be working with an easier game because of the stat reduction of all enemies in the game";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:08 AM;"Yes, but handicapping yourself can balance things out";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:08 AM;...at least to some degree;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 07:09 AM;Or I can just make the game nice and easy...;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:09 AM;"Heresy, it must be the Dark Souls of FF";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:09 AM;:tabata:;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:09 AM;"Well, the real meat of the game is in the postcontent anyway";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:09 AM;"And yeah, I know. I'd handicap myself as well";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;Doing the hunts after you're done with the story is really fun;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;"I know you can emulate IJS, and I *think* it has the speed battle function? Though you have to deal with gambits not being buyable which confounds me to all hell";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;The Dark Souls of FF is XV;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;:tabata:;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;IZJS is the same as TZA;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;The exact same;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:10 AM;The difference is that the speedup is only up to 2x;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:11 AM;And you can't unlock the second license board;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:11 AM;~~that means it's not the exact same but let's leave semantics to another day~~;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:12 AM;There's plenty of differences though :p;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:12 AM;Effect capacity exists in IZJS. Not to mention that enemies didn't get the stat squish until TZA;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 07:13 AM;Yay for stat squishes;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:13 AM;Wooo~;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:14 AM;"Ah, the effect capacity is just the queue";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:14 AM;That's really nice;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:14 AM;"Anyway, not many differences";;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:14 AM;Just a few QoL changes;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:15 AM;"But yeah, IZJS remains the most difficult. It forces you into a single job, which means you can't get ALL THE THINGS from the original license board. While also having original enemy power";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:16 AM;Only thing I don't like is that espers are shit until TZA;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:18 AM;Implying they aren't shit anymore;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:18 AM;:tabata:;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:19 AM;"I mean, they aren't :P Though there's still little reason to use them afaik";;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:20 AM;I'd like it if they were like... a souped up version of Yuna's aeons;;
Caius#6568;13-Sep-18 07:20 AM;I preferred the old western license board version. Making my own build for characters was fun. Only real problem I have with TZA is not being able to choose between the two board types but it doesn't matter too much;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:21 AM;They're the only unit on the field. Give them access to magic you can't get access to for a while. Have them absorb elements in relation to their elemental affinity;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:21 AM;Yeah let's go with that;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 07:21 AM;Anyway gotta run to uni have a nice day!;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 07:21 AM;"Of course, you'd have to make the enemies difficult enough to warrant consistent/semi-consistent esper use";;

Caius#6568;13-Sep-18 07:23 AM;Have a good one;;

Brion#4623;13-Sep-18 12:17 PM;i actually recommend googling the NES instruction manual for FF1;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:28 PM;Even VI wasn't this rough in the early going;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:28 PM;I just crossed the bridge to the northern continent;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:28 PM;Ah gotcha.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:28 PM;Everything was going swimmingly until then;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:28 PM;I actually know where to go;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:29 PM;but I tried heading north at first to this cave... and the random battles went from a joke to HOLYSHITDIDIJUSTGETONESHOTTED as I was approaching;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:29 PM;lol.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:29 PM;went from these little bitch goblins to some massive hulk looking dude and his tigers;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:30 PM;"At that point in the game, Ogres are the best source of exp and cash.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:30 PM;"Yeah, that's probably what this asshole was";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:30 PM;but I had no chance. He was doing like 30-40 damage to me per attack;;

Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:35 PM;Never had to grind;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;I would kill for that much gil... rhyme intended;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;Gil comes in so easily;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;So pretty much at level 6-7 I shouldnt be struggling like I am;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;It's ridiculous;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;I wonder waht I'm doing wrong;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;I'm as equipped as I can be coming out of Cornelia;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:36 PM;Do some early grind;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:37 PM;It's the only grinding you will ever do in the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:37 PM;where? Up by that cave? I'm not sure I can even grind there yet...;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;Pretty much anywhere;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;even the little bitch goblins?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;at least I know I can poop on them;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;haha;;
Marcello#4574;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;I grinded for about 10 minutes outside Cornelia;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;"I only grinded in one section and that's because I was so underleveled when I got to the Ice Cave. I went to the first crystal, then I went straight for the floater (or levistone in modern remakes), and I was at like level 20 something. So I grinded to 31.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;I should just go outside cornelia for an hour;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:38 PM;and roll into the inn as needed;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:39 PM;"ok, doing this live...";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:40 PM;"yeah, I'm level 6 on all characters";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:40 PM;"The Evil Eye gives you good exp and good gil at that point in the game, and you can fight him over and over and over again. And you can take him done with like two or three hits.";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:42 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Level 6 should be a high enough level to go to Pravoka.;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:43 PM;I was thinking about beating the boss completely unarmed.;;
Brion#4623;13-Sep-18 12:44 PM;@Perrydice#9311 I didn't know i had to equip weapons/armor until after i was leaving pravoka. so i was probably overleveled from grinding enough to be able to punch everything to death;;
Brion#4623;13-Sep-18 12:45 PM;i thought that assigning it to a character would equip it... of course not;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:45 PM;wait... I just beat two ogres with not too much problem...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:46 PM;probably doesnt help that my BM has a defense of 1;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:46 PM;same with WM;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:46 PM;Lol.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:47 PM;hmm...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:47 PM;"ok, I made it to provoka... I can probably grind outside of this town for an hour and against better enemies";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:48 PM;Talk to Bikke at Pravoka and he will give you a ship.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:49 PM;word.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 12:49 PM;"holy crap, 97 exp and 380 gil for taking down two ogres";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:49 PM;"Also, right in the water near Provoka, there are enemies called Kyzoku (Buccaneer, I believe in the modern remakes). They give you 120 gil per Buccaneer. Great way to raise cash when your low level.";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 12:51 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Hell yeah. Ogres, at that point in the game, are your best source of exp and cash... until you get money for the Fira and Dia spell. Then there's a bug you can take advantage of northeast of Pravoka.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 07:00 PM;Alright @Perrydice#9311 I made some pretty good progress.;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 07:11 PM;"I played the GBA version recently and I was at the 4th orb at 6 hours. I have beaten the GBA, the PS1, and the NES version.";;
pokemongenius#1474;13-Sep-18 08:28 PM;All PS2s have backwards compatibility;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Sep-18 09:51 PM;even i have backwards capability;;

52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:31 PM;I feel like WOFF is cheating I love it so much;;
Tactician White#7779;15-Sep-18 08:32 PM;"Hmm, so it's a game you would recommend?";;
Tactician White#7779;15-Sep-18 08:32 PM;Although I probably wouldn't get as much out of it since I'm still a total newbie to FF...;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:34 PM;I'm a HUGE monster collector lover;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:34 PM;like its my fav genre of game by far;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:34 PM;if you like collecting monsters and you like JRPG i don't see how you dislike WOFF unless you really hate the art.;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:35 PM;the story isn't ultra serious but its still there its kinda Kingdom heartsy in that way;;
Tactician White#7779;15-Sep-18 08:35 PM;"Oh no, I mean that, since there's lots of cameos of previous FF games, I wouldn't recognize and enjoy them as much.";;
Tactician White#7779;15-Sep-18 08:35 PM;But I do like monster collecting...;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:38 PM;the cameos are almost all humour;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:38 PM;like... idk they made the game better but IMO the monster collecting alone made hte game shine;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Sep-18 08:39 PM;Theaterhythm is my personal favorite because I like rhythm games;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:40 PM;theater rymth was super fun;;

52_bloodeyes#0947;15-Sep-18 08:40 PM;but i def like WOFF more just on cuteness scale theaterrymth won;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-18 11:52 PM;"or atleast they should, because the lag issues are not a hardware problem";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-18 11:53 PM;it's something stupid they did with the PSP port that deliberately slows the speed of the game during these moments;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-18 11:54 PM;there was a mod that attempted to undo these changes but idk how well it works and for the record the mobile version doesn't have this problem so if you want you can just play that instead;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Sep-18 11:54 PM;since it's the same as the PSP port;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-18 12:02 AM;you miss out on a few jobs that were added and the neat little FMVs for certain scenes;;

Giant Enemy Crab#0569;20-Sep-18 12:31 PM;"So it sounds like Crisis Core won't get a rerelease :(, , Also the VII remake is likely the next new game to come out and that won't happen until late 2020 since that's the current release date.";;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;20-Sep-18 12:36 PM;"That's still a really long time between now and then so at the very least, I expect some old stuff. Crisis Core is likely last due to the aforementioned copyright issues but I, II and Tactics are likely coming next. It's been half a year since Chrono Trigger released.

Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:33 PM;"Well, there's a few options., -Get another black mage, and have them both get Blizzara from Village of the Ancients. You can also get Cura from there as well, -Farm Antarctic Winds items from the monsters on the sea surrounding the island, -Get the ice helm, armor and shield from Dwarven Hollows and put it on your warrior. He can easily survive and deal plenty of damage to Salamander with that setup. Also the Freezing Sword, which is found on level 2 of Molten Cave, -Ice arrows with a Killer Bow is another option";;
FireProne#0537;21-Sep-18 04:51 PM;"I guess I'll just go farm some antartics, my monk will just spam those while my mage heals, black mage has blizzara and blizzard and I have the freezing blade for my warrior plus the armor.";;

Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 11:39 AM;"Yeah, pretty much. IV is easy to most people because most people spend time getting equipment. But since you get so much exp in every battle, you commonly end up 3-5 levels over the recommended level so nothing is a challenge";;

Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 11:42 AM;Rydia is just unfortunately borderline useless at that point in the game. Edward sucks as a character (though his harp(s) do more damage than Rydia does to most things) and Rosa has to rely on her Aim ability to contribute any damage;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 11:45 AM;Well Rydia has healing and summons which one shots most things in hob.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 11:45 AM;And yeah Rosa seems only able to aim and even then she’s taking down like 20-30 hp.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:07 PM;You think Cecil to 18 is enough?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:08 PM;I’m barely 15 now;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:09 PM;I will say it’s a lot more fun when you’re playing blind.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 12:09 PM;yeah;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 12:18 PM;"18 will be fine, yeah. And very true";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:44 PM;"Ok. So I’m at 16 now with Cecil. Rydia is 13, Rosa 11 and just learned raise!! Fuck. I wouldn’t have had any issues with that.";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 12:45 PM;Yeah :p Raise is wonderful;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:46 PM;So literally 10 mins of grinding would have been enough. Oh well. Back at hob cave now. Taking a break and then I’ll roll through it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:46 PM;(Bought 20 Phoenix downs just in case);;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 12:47 PM;"I also set up rows so that right now everyone except Cecil is in the back. Which means when this new guy gets in my party, he’ll be front row too which I think is right because he’s a melee dude.";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 12:48 PM;"Correct, yep";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 01:11 PM;Ok I was just under leveled a bit.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 01:12 PM;I made it through no problem that time. No Phoenix downs needed.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 01:12 PM;Just coming up on fabul or whatever it’s called.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 01:14 PM;Cool beans 👍;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 01:21 PM;I actually feel a sense of accomplishment. Rather than usually just reading through a guide.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 03:35 PM;I have to stop myself from looking at walkthroughs.  I keep wanting to just take a peek to see what’s coming up.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 03:36 PM;"Lmao, yeah :p";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 03:36 PM;I only do that if I can't get past a boss;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 03:41 PM;I haven’t looked anything up yet.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:04 PM;Dunno. Not much...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:04 PM;I bought a bunch of armor in mysidia;;

Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:06 PM;Though it's actually pretty easy for that point in the game. Since you have the Deathbringer (or should) which will always one-shot the Zus in that area;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 08:06 PM;The twins;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:06 PM;Shh;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:06 PM;But you'd also end up boosting your levels which lowers the challenge and all that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:06 PM;I have deathbringer. I KO those things no problem.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:07 PM;"Ah, cool";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:07 PM;"Well, you should have the money for it after Mount Ordeals anyways and is very worth its price tag";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:07 PM;You’re given deathbringer as part of the story.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:08 PM;What is? That last piece of undead gear?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:08 PM;I also bought gear for the twins.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:08 PM;"IV goes down that annoying trend the entire damn game. You think oh wow, I've got 170k gil, I can buy a lot of stuff, >piece of armor costs 60k, *Fuuuuuck yooooooou*";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:08 PM;Ha. Pretty much every FF game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:09 PM;And yeah. I’ll easily have the cash for it after this dungeon.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:09 PM;"Well, FF is very controlled in its gil prices. Usually. So 170k gil is usually a lot. Just not in IV where they go crazy with gil inflation & prices";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:24 PM;And is the ordeals dungeon long? Wondering if I can do it now or need to wait til wife and kid go to bed.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:24 PM;Not on the levels of FF1;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:25 PM;And Ordeals is kinda long;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:25 PM;Sure;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:25 PM;Meaning more linear than 1?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:25 PM;I’m only end of disc one for 8 but I’ll try;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:25 PM;Less;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:26 PM;So more open than 1;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:26 PM;It is a queen of cards related question;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:26 PM;As open as VI?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:26 PM;It's the first true story based FF;;

BUT, I have looked pretty much every place on the map. Can some one fill me in on what I may not be doing or may not have done? I cant remember if I spoke to her about her artist father when she was in Dollet. However, I am also not certain that the QoC just dissapears if one does not have that particular dialogue with her. Anyone know?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:26 PM;I’m a big fan of triple triad. Go.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:27 PM;Jegged.com has a really good guide for it though.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:27 PM;Read through it.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:27 PM;Short answer is: it's best to bounce Queen Of Cards between Balamb and Dollet;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:27 PM;Yea;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:28 PM;I have learned that in my readings;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:28 PM;Just not certain if the Qoc dissapears for any reason;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:28 PM;And you still can’t find her?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:28 PM;I don’t think she does.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:28 PM;Nope;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:28 PM;Ive checked all of the listed locations. And no where to be found . Its buggin me out. Hahah;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:29 PM;Hmm. That’s odd.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:30 PM;Ive checked FH.. Balamb.. Lunar Gate.. escape pod.. Winhill.. Deiling. . DOLLET..Shumi Village.. esthar.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:30 PM;Didn’t go to Deling city?;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:32 PM;"Then, get to disc 4";;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:33 PM;I could..;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:34 PM;Sometimes you just gotta push on.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:34 PM;But then that is basically skipping the quest and grabbing the cards from her in the one spot.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:34 PM;Yeah.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 08:34 PM;Such is life.;;

aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:36 PM;Basically.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:36 PM;Wanted to finish up by doing this quest and moving forward.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:39 PM;"Im thinking I missed a dialogue with her, one that would have triggered her to move and also get her dad painting the other cards.";;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:39 PM;Thats the only explanation. That or a glitch. Haha 😂;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:43 PM;"The only way, besides a glitch, to not trigger her moving is not doing the sidequest";;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:46 PM;Yeah. I have no idea. Ill maybe move forward and create a save file that will allow me to go back and figure things out  if I come across a way.;;
aseofspades#6154;23-Sep-18 08:46 PM;Been flying all over with no luck. Lol;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 08:56 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Late af to it since I'm writing up something. Mount Ordeals is pretty short. Encounters can be kinda random and annoying, but it's considerably shorter than other dungeons are. Made up by having two boss encounters in it";;

Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 06:45 AM;"@🅶🅰🅻🅰🅲🆃🅸🅲  Bambi#4955 I prefer the remakes of Final Fantasy IV over the original. The original IV is too dumb down, way too easy, and completely butchered such as half the moves were omitted from the Super Famicom version of IV. Plus, the translation job isn't good. I think the writing is superior in the remakes, especially the DS remake. However, the one advantage of the original SNES is no grinding is really necessary because the game gives you a shit ton of exp. and cash, and most of the bosses are a cakewalk (maybe Evil Wall and the CPU core, but that's like it). But, in my opinion, if you want to play FFIV, I would recommend either the PSP version, or if you cannot get your hands on it, the Steam version and choose Normal difficulty is another great option.";;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 08:49 AM;"Most people would recommend the PSP version... and there's a lot to like about it. The 2D sprites look pretty good and it's a good rendition of the original while keeping all the abilities that were included in the Japanese version.. but I really like the DS remake, and is without a doubt my favorite version of this game. I understand it's a subjective opinion that people may disagree that the voice acting is not so good or they don't like the animation style. I personally like both the voice acting and the animation style. I could be a biased because it's a chibi style similar to FFIX, and I love Final Fantasy IX. I do think that overall, the voice acting is pretty good and the writing is fantastic... and it's really challenging, a difficult game. I had so much fun playing the DS remake. If you are an expert at Final Fantasy games, I definitely recommend the DS remake.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Sep-18 09:06 AM;@Perrydice#9311 am I right re: my question above?;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 09:11 AM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Yes. You should go there... it will take you somewhere familiar.;;

Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 09:16 AM;I would work on it but I really want to try to finish my FF8 journey first.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Sep-18 09:37 AM;Yeah you finish 8.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Sep-18 09:38 AM;And I know it takes me back to baron. But the king told me the entrance was to the east. So I did t know if I had to trek back to ordeals or if that door just to the east of the castle was the spot. I figured it was. I’ll just shut up and play blind like I said I would.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 09:52 AM;"Yeah, I'm hoping Final Fantasy VIII will pick up because I am having trouble getting into the game. It's been a long time and I remember it being slow at the beginning, but it's been such a long time that I barely remember the game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Sep-18 09:57 AM;You’re deeper into the game than I am now so I have no idea.;;

Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 10:36 AM;I haven't yet.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 10:36 AM;I will say this on a positive note... I do like Triple Triad. It's pretty simple and it has some good strategies to win the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Sep-18 11:11 AM;"Hmm, something you said I didn't recognize so thought you were just deeper into it.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Sep-18 11:11 AM;I'm right at the end of disc one.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:03 PM;I specialize in dad jokes;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:04 PM;"Some appropriate for kids, others more appropriate for teens (especially after I've had a few too many beers)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:04 PM;"Um, I was asking if there was a recommended level for cecil at the point in the game where I am (back at baron castle, just picked up Yang after having a bar brawl with him and his buddies)";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 01:05 PM;Hold up;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 01:05 PM;Let me boot up my save;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:06 PM;I was also able to afford the armor for Yang from the shop there that I opened with the key. That really helped his defense;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:06 PM;I don't need to be overleveled... but I'd like to be at or slightly above recommended;;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 01:06 PM;"Okay, so you've done Mount Ordeals right?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 01:07 PM;"I have my Cecil at 11, and the twins at 17";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 01:07 PM;"However, I am a bit more experienced";;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 01:08 PM;"So uh, around level 10-12 is a pretty good spot to ensure Cecil has a bit of white magic and also doesn't die despite his natural tankiness";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:08 PM;"ok, so I have cecil at 14 adn the twins at 20";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:09 PM;can't remember sage or yang's level;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 01:09 PM;"I should continue playing, but I use my vita for music at work";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:10 PM;"haha, I did a bit of grinding earlier while I was reading for work... just hit the directional buttons and then keep hitting X... haha";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:11 PM;i think cecil just has cure and sight right now;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;25-Sep-18 01:11 PM;but one of the twins is a white mage and so is tellah;;

Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 01:37 PM;"There's basically three ways to win, 1) Easy mode: have a party full of monks counterattack the hand form. The hand form only performs weak physicals, and countterattacks are never countered against so it'll never change form, 2) Gravity, Blizzara and Shiva. You can boost Blizzara with Frost Rods, along with boosting Shiva. Gravity at the start will remove 1500 HP outright. After that, pelt it with Blizzara while managing your health, 3) If you have at least two Frost Rods, you can break them for Blizzaga. Two Blizzaga spells will kill it instantly";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 06:11 PM;My suggestion is to grind like crazy;;

Ayman#0001;25-Sep-18 06:12 PM;no way;;
pokemongenius#1474;25-Sep-18 07:25 PM;Theres a small secret to job grinding. If you hit Guard multiple times in a fight you drastically increase your job experience;;

FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 12:39 PM;Oh okay I was confused because the beginning cutscene said after years.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Sep-18 01:10 PM;After Years is the sequel;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Sep-18 01:10 PM;Dont play The Crystals when you play TAY you'll hate FF4 if you do;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:31 PM;"And yes, I had the same confusion you did with the opening cutscene.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:33 PM;@Perrydice#9311 This waterway dungeon on the way to Baron Castle seems pretty damn long...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:34 PM;I finally got to the save point on B1... so I'm guessing I'm almost done (or almost at a boss)...;;
Brion#4623;26-Sep-18 01:35 PM;"i don't remember exactly how long it is, but yeah usually the save point is well past the halfway point";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:37 PM;I started on level B4... now I'm on B1;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:37 PM;So I've got to imagine its about done;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:37 PM;I've been down so many wrong turns... found a bunch of chests with nothing good in them;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:38 PM;"oh, and those monsters in there hit HARD";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 01:41 PM;well... that was the end of the dungeon apparently. I just popped out at the castle;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 01:45 PM;"So um, I want to move Rydia to the back row but when I press row it moves cecil back too, is there a way I can just move her or am I stuck with cecil being in the back too?";;
Brion#4623;26-Sep-18 01:53 PM;you have to move her to a position that is already in the back row;;
Brion#4623;26-Sep-18 01:53 PM;the rows are defined as front or  back entirely;;
Brion#4623;26-Sep-18 01:54 PM;"If you're on DS, go in to the Party menu and it will have either 2 front/3 back positions or vice versa";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 01:56 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 I see. I think you are further than me in my DS remake journey.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 01:56 PM;I am currently at the castle of Baron where I just got Yang back after becoming a Paladin.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:02 PM;have you played before?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:02 PM;im assuming yes;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:24 PM;"Yeah, I'm further than you are. I got past that dungeon, through the Castle, and am now at the next location.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:27 PM;"alright, back to work... fun lunch break while it lasted";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:30 PM;"Yes, I have played Final Fantasy IV... I love the DS version but the last time I played it to completion was on the SNES. I usually play the DS remake so I was playing it on the side. Just haven't made too much progress since becoming a Paladin.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:31 PM;"oh also, i feel like the airship comes into play very early in this game";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:31 PM;I started a DS run around the time I started FFV.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:31 PM;It comes in within like 20 minutes of Final Fantasy III.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:31 PM;ha;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:31 PM;I got it about 7 hours into this game;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:32 PM;I just haven't gotten around to continuing too much of it. I been trying to focus on the other games. I will get back to it. I may continue it after I complete either VIII or IX.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:33 PM;I really like it so far;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:33 PM;IV is a ton of fun.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:33 PM;lot of VI vibes... story isn't as good as VI;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:33 PM;but the characters are more manageable so far;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:33 PM;although the forced party shit is a little annoying;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:33 PM;I have some issues with the story.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;One of them is they come up with the dumbest reasons of why you can only have 5 members in the party.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;VI has the story;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;But the combat is way to easy along with breaking the game tbh;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;"Just like VII, where they come up with some stupid reasons why you can only have 3 members in your party.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;@Expanding Storm III#7924 VI is my favorite.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;i dont even remember the reasons... but year;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;yeah;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;9 is mine;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:34 PM;haven't played 9 yet;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;IX is my second favorite.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;8 is my 2nd because soundtrack;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;I am probably the minority but I really don't like the OST that much in VIII.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;Pure Flames 🔥;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;I think IV is going to jump over VII as my second favorite by the time I'm done;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;8 had eh story;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:35 PM;IV is a fan favorite.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:36 PM;Really slow paced protagonist;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;26-Sep-18 02:36 PM;But the music is good;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:36 PM;I agree with the slow pacing. I have seen YouTubers that say VIII has the best pacing and so far I just cannot agree with that assessment.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:37 PM;"And I don't really like the music for VIII and is probably due to personal musical tastes. The songs just don't really do much for me. Like, a lot of the songs feel filler to me and I am not a fan of Don't Be Afraid or Force Your Way.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:38 PM;I like the pacing because I don't feel like I have to worry about grinding levels.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:39 PM;and I like it also because you can mix in TT whenever you're getting a little tired of the push;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:39 PM;and there is obviously a good reason to play TT anyway... so it doesn't feel like an empty minigame;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:39 PM;"But it kinda encourages you to play Triple Triad quite a bit to get some good items for your GFs and upgrading your weapons, and I feel that it dramatically slows the pacing down.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:40 PM;It does indeed encourage you to play it but it's certainly not necessary from what I've heard;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:40 PM;That's true.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:40 PM;I've heard some people never even knew you could refine cards;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;"see, now I want to go play it";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;dammit;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;NO! I'm playing 4 til conclusion;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;gaming ADD striking again;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;Lol.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;Your complaints are more than valid though;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:41 PM;"If you are into IV, play IV.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:42 PM;most people apparently don't like 8 so I guess I'm in the minority in that I like it so far;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:42 PM;"It's not a bad criticism, per se, because I think TT is one of the better things about the game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:42 PM;it's the best minigame I've seen so far;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:42 PM;in terms of fun and productivity;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:44 PM;"I will admit that my opinion on the OST is a minority opinion. A lot of people really like the OST, but I just don't. Someone told me that, due to objective reasons about why the music should be good, I am stupid for not liking it... and I told him that music is art and personal tastes cannot be broken into a science. It's always subject to personal tastes.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:45 PM;i would agree with that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:45 PM;ha;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:45 PM;so wait... not everyone likes 80s music? BLASPHEMY;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Sep-18 02:45 PM;I mean that's what opinions are;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:46 PM;because 80s music is absolutely the best fucking music ever and nothing else comes close... ever;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Sep-18 02:46 PM;Correct;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:46 PM;haha;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:49 PM;"80s had some really good music. I really like a lot of 80s Rush, or bands like Whitesnake and Metallica.";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Sep-18 02:51 PM;We can agree on this :yeah:;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 02:51 PM;I really like how they kept the mechanic where you use magic infused weapons in IV.;;
Brion#4623;26-Sep-18 02:54 PM;"the 80s had operation ivy, so i can't argue";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:54 PM;do the weapons break if you use them as magic in IV?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:54 PM;I haven't even tried it yet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:55 PM;I was struggling in that waterway dungeon until I learned a specific spell that decimated basically every mob in there;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:55 PM;"I don't think so.... early on, when I used the Ice Rod with Rydia, it never broke. I have never had an issue with items breaking like the shields break in FFVI.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Sep-18 02:56 PM;"yeah, i was thinking about VI when I said that";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 02:57 PM;I like the Dancing Daggers. One of the best weapons in the game.;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Sep-18 03:12 PM;FFV breaks the weapons;;
hansy#9576;26-Sep-18 04:47 PM;"Does anybody here use online guides or walkthroughs when playing FF? If so, can I DM you with a couple questions?";;

My friends want me to give them a guide to VII because I know how to beat the superbosses.

the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:07 PM;so in ff8 whats to stop me from spamming shiva every turn? i dont fully understand summons in this game;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:07 PM;does it cost anything?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:13 PM;I mean if you want to do a Summon Only challenge...;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:14 PM;nah its just op as fuck (atleast at the part of the game im at);;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:14 PM;im just wondering if i shoudlnt be picking it every turn;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:15 PM;There's much better options like Junctioning magic to your Strength stat;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:15 PM;yeah im sure im still learning hwo all that works;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:15 PM;its so strange in thisg ame;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:16 PM;it's different for sure;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:16 PM;"Summoning takes forever, and each one has their own HP";;
pokemongenius#1474;27-Sep-18 01:16 PM;"GFs in summary: , , GF attack when summoned and they have an ATB much like the players., , GF have HP and can be knocked out and revived with an item or by resting., , GFs ATB can be altered with compatibility. More compatibility makes the bar faster., , When GF are knocked out they cannot get AP. AP is used to gain more abilities., , GFs power is based on level and magic power. Each can be boosted by abilities like Boost or Sum Mag+., , Boost grants a in battle button boost method to further strengthen summons. Hold Select during the summon animation and mash Square.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:16 PM;I really like the idea of it. I'm only at the end of disc 1 though so my opinion is still up for change;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:17 PM;^;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:17 PM;"thats super helpful, thanks pokemon";;
pokemongenius#1474;27-Sep-18 01:17 PM;I try my best;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:18 PM;**mumbles** I could have said that...;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:18 PM;haha you were helpful too ninja;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:18 PM;:D;;
pokemongenius#1474;27-Sep-18 01:18 PM;But you didnt :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:18 PM;I am going to try to play more of FF8 but I dunno. I'll probably knock out a chunk of it this weekend.;;
the worlds stringyest string#6203;27-Sep-18 01:18 PM;i like it so far but the way they handled every single thing is just..weird;;
pokemongenius#1474;27-Sep-18 01:19 PM;Its an experiment;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:20 PM;"Gah, I could be replaying a good FF, like 8, but noooooo. I'm stuck playing 2";;
pokemongenius#1474;27-Sep-18 01:22 PM;FF8 is a good game its just flawed;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:33 PM;It's good but not great.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:35 PM;Good enough to be in my top 5;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:35 PM;"Breaking the game, and the music really helps with that";;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:38 PM;"It's near the bottom for me. After my recent replay, I may put it above XV but this would make it the 4th from bottom on my list of FF games best to worst.";;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:39 PM;"But look at the silver lining, I am putting it higher than I had it. So it means I think it's better than others.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:39 PM;that's progress;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:40 PM;The same thing happened with my replaying of XIII;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:40 PM;best to worst for me right now: 6 > 4 (in progress) > 8 (in progress) > 7 > 1;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:41 PM;I've really liked all of them though.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:41 PM;Do I really need to say which one is my #1?;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:41 PM;That probably won't happen to me replaying XIII again. I am guessing it is going to be another grindfest like every single time I have tried replaying the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:41 PM;6 is my second favorite video  game of all time.;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:42 PM;"My favorite game of all time is Chrono Trigger. To me, that game is virtually flawless in every aspect.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:42 PM;Mass Effect 2 is mine.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 01:42 PM;"I have 3 games tied for first: Chrono Trigger, FF9, and KH2FM";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:42 PM;I have Chrono Trigger on my Vita... maybe I'll play that after 4 if I don't finish 8;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:43 PM;"A Link to the Past is number 2, followed by Final Fantasy VI.";;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:43 PM;Then I haven't really carved out games beyond top 3 of what I would consider my favorites.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:43 PM;Never played a Zelda game except for Zelda II on the NES;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:43 PM;back in like 1988;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:44 PM;Probably an unpopular opinion but I like Zelda II.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:44 PM;more like 1990 actually when I was 8;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:44 PM;I cried when I couldn't beat one of the armored dudes in an early dungeon.;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:44 PM;I don't think it's the best but I do like the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:45 PM;I can actually remember crying and literally sweating because I was so worked up.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:46 PM;I went back to Tecmo World Wrestling and Tecmo Bowl afterwards. It was much more up my alley back then.;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:47 PM;Tecmo Bowl was ridiculous but awesome. All you had to be was the LA Raiders and do the play with Bo Jackson running.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:48 PM;Yup;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:48 PM;Haha. We had a rule no Bo Jackson;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:48 PM;Unless you were playing the computer;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:48 PM;Lol.;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:49 PM;It's literally in Bo Jackson's 30 for 30.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:49 PM;"Yup, I saw that.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:50 PM;"also, if you haven't seen the Ric Flair 30 for 30, I highly recommend it";;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:50 PM;Lol.;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 01:50 PM;The Nature Boy was always kinda funny.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:55 PM;His 30 for 30 is equal party comedy and sadness.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 01:55 PM;* equal parts;;
Brion#4623;27-Sep-18 02:18 PM;link to the past has been my favorite game forever. i doubt anything will ever pass it for me;;
Brion#4623;27-Sep-18 02:19 PM;"i managed to piece together a full copy of it. original cartridge, box, manual, maps, etc";;
Brion#4623;27-Sep-18 02:20 PM;twisted metal 2 would be way up there. final fantasy tactics. not really sure how i would order favorites beyond LTTP;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 02:21 PM;Crisis Core is my 2nd favorite;;
pokemongenius#1474;27-Sep-18 02:21 PM;ALTTP randomizers better :yeah:;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;27-Sep-18 02:27 PM;"My favorite games are Fallout 2, Deus Ex, the Mass Effect trilogy and Street Fighter III: Third Strike.";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;27-Sep-18 03:35 PM;"I'm in Bravely Default rn and I'm in chapter 7. I'm getting destroyed from the Ominas battle. Everyone's at level 64, do I need to grind more?";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Sep-18 03:58 PM;If you're getting wrecked by something the answer is always 'grind moar';;
Rasea#1840;27-Sep-18 04:06 PM;I've no idea on that. You could check the FF wikia page or Google or something. I've never played the game before;;
Rasea#1840;27-Sep-18 04:07 PM;Though I personally prefer beating something without having to grind away any challenge;;
Bruce#0080;27-Sep-18 04:13 PM;"Yeah, that's not always the only option..... Doesn't work in some games, actually";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:26 PM;that took a bit to get to this lodestone cavern in IV. Lucked my way into chocobo forest;;
Perrydice#9311;27-Sep-18 04:26 PM;Lol;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:27 PM;not sure how i would have known to do that without a little luck;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:28 PM;would have driven myself nuts trying to land at the cave itself;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:28 PM;having the airship would make me think that's the best transportation available;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:28 PM;anyone know the recommended level for this Lodestone joint?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:29 PM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 04:32 PM;I'm guessing your current levels are fine;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 04:32 PM;"Also, @Santa Filthy Casual#9506 have you explored *all* of Troia?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:34 PM;"All? I made it to the chocobo nursery, the strip club (burned 10k gil for a ticket)... um, found Edward... a bunch of chests in the castl";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:34 PM;castle;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:34 PM;hidden chests if you take the waterway in troia (town);;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:35 PM;Cecil is level 18 by the way. Others in the low 20s;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 04:35 PM;Should be good;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:35 PM;I should probably grind for a while anyway;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 04:36 PM;"One more piece of advice, bring non metallic equipment";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:36 PM;I'm guessing that strip club is part of a side quest along with all the dancing girls in these different towns. I'll figure it out later.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:36 PM;"Yeah, I already knew about the non-metallic equipment";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:36 PM;I've been talking to EVERYONE in the towns and castles since I'm playing blind;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:36 PM;I had to make some purchases at the weapon and armor shops;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:37 PM;because I sold all my feathered and leather shit earlier;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Sep-18 04:37 PM;Get Cecil to 20;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:37 PM;playing blind is SO much more fun. I'm kinda bummed I played 6 with a guide the first time;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:38 PM;"OK, he's almost at 19 anyway so a handful of fights outside Troia will do the trick";;
Rasea#1840;27-Sep-18 04:41 PM;"In fairness to VI, it's *really* obscure and vague about where you're supposed to go";;
Rasea#1840;27-Sep-18 04:41 PM;Not to mention secret characters;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:54 PM;"yeah, i love the game... but without a guide, I would have gotten a very shallow playthrough of it.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:54 PM;But I understand that FF in general is about obsessive exploration and experimentation (giggity)... it's taken me a while to get used to that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:55 PM;Atleast most of them are usually intuitive even if they dont always spell it out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:55 PM;Could be FF1 lol;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:56 PM;I actually found FF1 to be maybe the most intuitive I've played so far.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:56 PM;Interesting;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:56 PM;Oddly enough... I know that's a minority opinion.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:56 PM;Maybe because it was small enough in scope for me to get my arms around.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:56 PM;They only spot that really got me was when you have to sneak through some trees next to one of the towns to find the sages;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:56 PM;Yeah lol most tend to have trouble with it due to the lack of direction;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:57 PM;"Process of elimination is much easier in FFI than, say, FF6";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:57 PM;And then once IV came along it became a lot easier to just follow where the story is taking you;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:58 PM;"yeah, 4 so far has been pretty linear";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:58 PM;I haven't struggled at all until just now getting the black chocobo to get to the lodestone cavern;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:58 PM;I was lucky to wander into the right area... so maybe that's just part of it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:59 PM;I've said this before but despite the shit we give IV TAY it has a far better central plot than the first game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:59 PM;(Almost to the point where I would recommend it as a better version due to how much it rehashes);;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 04:59 PM;Is the gameplay similar?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 04:59 PM;Yes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:00 PM;Same gameplay with some changes;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:00 PM;Oh cool. I might play the Interlude and TAY afterwards;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:00 PM;Interlude doesn't have them though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:00 PM;But TAY does;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:01 PM;You have group attacks called bands and certain attacks (or magic) can be stronger or weaker depending on the moon phase;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:01 PM;Similar to SMT but a little more direct I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:02 PM;But people dislike the game because it copies and retreads a lot of stuff from the first game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:15 PM;what's SMT?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:16 PM;google says it's Shin Megami Tensei... still don't know what that is.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:17 PM;Another jrpg series;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:17 PM;ah;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:17 PM;Is TAY a similar length to IV?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:18 PM;A little longer;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:18 PM;wow;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:18 PM;The first half of the game is split between multiple characters;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:18 PM;wasn't sure if it amounted to a DLC or something;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:18 PM;With each scenario being around 3 to 5 hours long;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:18 PM;Give or take more if you do challenging way dungeon;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:20 PM;how long after IV did TAY come out?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:20 PM;10 years apart I think;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:20 PM;Or a little more;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:21 PM;oh wow;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:21 PM;It was originally a Wiiware game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:21 PM;And each story arc was sold separately;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:21 PM;The PSP version includes them all together though;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:22 PM;"Yeah, i have the PSP version on my Vita";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:22 PM;But timeline wise it also takes place 18 years after the events of the first game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:22 PM;Interlude is a few months after the first game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 05:23 PM;I think;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Sep-18 05:23 PM;interesting;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:21 AM;So I have a question. I find myself getting annoyed at the random encounter rate in dungeons. To the point that I really don’t want to explore if I don’t have to. Anyone else have similar feelings and/or know how to deal with it?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:22 AM;Fucking moogle charm is the greatest invention in the history of FF.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:24 AM;I get frustrated after a while because I want to explore but then I take two steps and am cut off by an encounter.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 10:24 AM;"I start to get annoyed when running out of HP/MP, and haven't saved in a while";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:25 AM;Yeah. That too.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 10:25 AM;"Now, on the flip side, I'm used to IV's encounter rate";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:26 AM;It’s all of the games.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 10:27 AM;Either way;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:28 AM;But I’m playing 4 now. So maybe it’s because it’s that high?;;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 10:29 AM;"Fun fact: FF7's encounter rate is tied to in-game step count, so you can actually plan when you want to encounter vs not encounter. Not sure if this particular mechanic is present in other FF games";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:31 AM;Wish the others did that. Not sure if they do.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:31 AM;"I don't recall VII doing that, but I'd have to check the technical side of the game";;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 10:32 AM;"@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 it's how speedrunners of FF7 take very precise, very planned fights to minimize time";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:33 AM;in IV though it is based on a table indicating at which the step counts your encounters will happen on but it is purely relative;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:33 AM;"I'm sure they do, I just don't remember much about it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:33 AM;it's a common thing used in speedrunning jrpgs to manipulate encounters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:34 AM;in IV runs they deliberately save quit to avoid them;;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 10:34 AM;"Ah interesting; did not know that";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:35 AM;"anyway that being said, I never felt like FF's encounter rates were that high overall";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:35 AM;maybe the older games (especially in their NES counterparts);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:36 AM;"one thing I do wish FF had, was the battle indicator that SMT has, where even though it is random you atleast know when the next fight is going to happen";;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 10:37 AM;Like a visual cue?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:37 AM;yes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:38 AM;in SMT you have a small indicator in the corner of the screen that starts out blue and gradually turns red as you walk around;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:38 AM;so when it starts getting red you know a fight is going to happen and can atleast prepare;;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 10:40 AM;"IMO, random encounters are net negative to a gaming experience. I like being able to see enemies and choosing to engage or not; similar to FF12 (and perhaps newer FF games, though I'm not as familiar with them)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 10:42 AM;It just wears on me after a while.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:42 AM;"It depends, when the encounters are high it can be repetitive especially with transitions etc... with visible enemies you are limited to walking long distances to clear out mobs";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:42 AM;then having to reset the dungeon (or a particular map) in order to fight anything again;;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 10:42 AM;"This is true; grinding is perhaps more tedious in the latter scenario";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-18 10:43 AM;"for farming, the former is always better and more consistent, and for pacing, the latter is better because you have the ability to engage or not";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:04 AM;So basically I’m hearing that I should shut the fuck up and deal with it because that’s just the way it is.;;
hansy#9576;29-Sep-18 11:09 AM;"lolol. In a word, yes. But if it's super painful, I'd move on to something else. Life's too short to deal with miserable RNG.";;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:09 AM;Well.... Yeah?;;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:10 AM;"Thing is, in FFIV, you shouldn't be getting overlevelled from random battles in general";;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:11 AM;"So, you can run from them but you'll likely become underlevelled....";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:11 AM;It’s fine. It’s what I’ve been telling myself. I just don’t know if others get frustrated in the same way.;;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:12 AM;"Eh, sure, it can get a bit irritating.... Its part of most jrpgs, though";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:12 AM;"When I run, I feel like I am missing out on xp and cash";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:12 AM;So I don’t run.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:13 AM;I’d rather be over-leveled so the fights don’t take as long and I don’t burn through MP or items;;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:13 AM;"Yeah, that's basically best....";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:13 AM;Ha.;;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:14 AM;Do you want a guide for the augments in FFIV  ...?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:14 AM;No thanks. I’m playing completely blind.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:14 AM;I don’t even know what augments are yet.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 11:15 AM;They're exclusive to the 3D version of IV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 11:15 AM;Oh. Never mind then. I’m PSP version.;;

Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:18 AM;"1st on DS, then reworked for Android & iOS & finally ported to Steam";;
Bruce#0080;29-Sep-18 11:19 AM;"Apart from the graphics, there's a few tweaks in general gameplay.... & an augment system. But the 2 optional extra dungeons from PSP version dropped & you can't choose your party for the final dungeon";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 12:11 PM;Makes sense. I’ve only played a couple.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 12:43 PM;"`IMO, random encounters are net negative to a gaming experience` I'm late to it, but people generally consider this to be nothing but a positive, which isn't the case at all. Eliminating random encounters and favoring interactive field models means that you heavily limit level design";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Not entirely.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 12:51 PM;No style is inherently bad.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 12:57 PM;I never said it was bad :P;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 12:58 PM;"But it does inhibit level design. Which just means it has a flaw, like any system does";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 12:58 PM;You can't create mazes or small corridors or acrobatic mechanics with field models because they'll interfere with all of that;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 12:59 PM;"As is evidenced by every RPG with field models using large, wide areas so that they have ample room for them + architecture + chests and anything else";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 01:01 PM;"Monstro in KH1 is a bloody maze with ample room for field models, chests *and* large areas";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 01:02 PM;That's because they use spawn locations and field battle. Not models that you get into an encounter with for strategic combat;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 01:05 PM;"On a side note, I'd say the KH games are a nice compromise between Random Encounters and always visible encounters";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 01:05 PM;"Yeah, I really enjoy them";;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Sep-18 01:06 PM;Should I finish KH2?;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 01:06 PM;And it's not like the KH areas are big. There's plenty of small areas or areas with small corridors;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Sep-18 01:06 PM;I got through the Roxas part and was like nah fuck that lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Sep-18 01:07 PM;Probably gonna get the PS4 collection because I didn't enjoy trying to beat it on PS3;;

Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 01:33 PM;I never used it;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 02:07 PM;"Also semi-related, but looking into the trophy list for KH2.5HD makes me want to jump off a tall cliff. KH2's trophies aren't too bad. The worst ones are beating Lingering Will, Mushroom XIII, all Org XIII fights beaten, and all journal entries. Time consuming, but not hard (LW being the exception, but it's only one fight), , Buuuut then KHBBS has three trophies for beating Mysterious Figure, No Heart and Armor of Eraqus. Uuuuuugh";;

Trickster#9840;29-Sep-18 04:46 PM;You have to visit the dwarven king to get that;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:47 PM;"Sylph Cave is naturally difficult, there's really no way around it";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:47 PM;You can use Rune Armlets on the three characters that can use them (avoiding names so I don't spoil things for Filthy);;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:47 PM;"Your two front liners can't use them though, so they'll be screwed";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:48 PM;"You basically either run from every encounter, or do each encounter once for the bestiary entries and then run because those fights are just stupid, annoying and take forever";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:48 PM;"If you're at the recommended level (36, so Rosa has Float), then it's perfectly doable. Just stupidly unfair";;
FireProne#0537;29-Sep-18 04:53 PM;"Yeah tbh this is probably the hardest dungeon I ever ran into so far lol, you have those annoying toads, plants that do insane amount of damage, I kind of have to kill them in groups because the chest on the lower floor contains some good stuff.";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:54 PM;The chest fights basically give you all the bestiary entries in that dungeon and you have to take them out. So you can just avoid all encounters until then;;
FireProne#0537;29-Sep-18 04:56 PM;I also learned that stop is really useful;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:57 PM;"Yeah, it can definitely give you breathing room";;

Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:57 PM;The ones I hate most are the stupid treants because they always get turns before you and always cast Fira/Sleep. Which just means sitting through 50 spell animations *every god damn fight*;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:58 PM;Not to mention having no counter for Sleep either;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 04:59 PM;"Unfair doesn't inherently mean difficult :P Sylph Cave was perfectly doable for me. But given what they make you fight, what the enemies can use vs your party and all that, it's unfair";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 05:27 PM;Right;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:32 PM;Bad Advice Day;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:32 PM;Two words;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:32 PM;BAD for short;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:32 PM;White Magic;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:32 PM;Also no Swords;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:33 PM;I... huh?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:33 PM;Two words: Cecil doesn't get much;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:33 PM;Magic is not influenced by your row;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:33 PM;Yes but defense is;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:33 PM;Also Ancient Sword should be good;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:33 PM;That actually worked for me;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:34 PM;You want Cecil in the Front row with Cid & Yang for maximum damage;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:34 PM;"Yeah, today is BAD";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:34 PM;Since you miss more often in the back row;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:34 PM;Bow;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:35 PM;Also Cecil is pretty tanky so there's no reason to put him in the Back row as he doesn't have issues surviving;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:35 PM;And Bow suffers accuracy pentalties when in the back row;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:35 PM;Whereas Tellah suffers in the front;;
Trickytbone#8178;29-Sep-18 05:35 PM;I said put Tellah in back;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:36 PM;Tellah and Cid in back row;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:36 PM;Yang and Cecil in front;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:37 PM;Why Cid in the back? 🤔;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:41 PM;"He's too slow to be an effective fighter, so keep him aa a backup healer";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:43 PM;Using potions or hi-potions? Doesn't make much sense. He still deals decent damage from the front row and has plenty of health to survive. He doesn't have any support abilities that would be reasonable to have him be in the back row;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:43 PM;I could see it if like... Lodestone Cavern was difficult to any degree but it's pretty easy overall;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:45 PM;"Honestly, Cid works front or back, I just like to keep him on the back, like **grits teeth** *a proper Engineer*";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:50 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:50 PM;I'd figure Cid's over-energetic hyper nutcase ass would be in the front;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:50 PM;And would never accept anything to the contrary;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 05:51 PM;That sounds right. I already have them in those spots though. Yang Cecil cid in front.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 05:52 PM;Tellah chilling in the back doing whatever he does.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 05:52 PM;Being old and stubborn;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-18 05:56 PM;Poor Tellah doesn't have a buddy;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 07:36 PM;Ok. So that dungeon wasn’t too bad at all.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 07:36 PM;But uh... you’re forced right into another dungeon??;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 07:38 PM;Arghhh. I just wanted to dick around for a while.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 07:39 PM;I guess I could hop on a black chocobo and try to find another city or something. Although I’m guessing I am still in a linear situation.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 07:50 PM;Oh and damn the encounters hit hard.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 08:25 PM;It only gets worse;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 08:25 PM;:>;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 08:33 PM;The encounters?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 08:34 PM;It’s a great place to level though. Each encounter is like 1200xp;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 08:35 PM;"Yeah, the encounters";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 08:35 PM;FFIV has a really weird idea of balance;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 08:46 PM;"What bothers me is there is no time for an Xp grab. One dungeon ends, quick story stuff, then straight to another dungeon.";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 08:48 PM;Pretty much because every encounter gives high amounts of XP so you basically stay leveled just going through the game;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 08:48 PM;"Unlike something like... III, V or VI where you're encouraged to grind";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 08:52 PM;I think I went through 3 levels in lodestone;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:01 PM;Yep;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:01 PM;Which I think is done to keep FFIV a short game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:04 PM;Am I good to go through this dungeon? I think Cecil is 24;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:05 PM;And is it long?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:06 PM;Trying to decide if I should roll through it tonight.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:07 PM;Lodestone or something different?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:08 PM;I already did lodestone;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:08 PM;The tower right after;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:08 PM;"Oh, Tower of Zot";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:08 PM;Yeah;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:08 PM;"It's of decent length, especially with all the treasure";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Sep-18 09:09 PM;Same as lodestone in length?;;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:10 PM;"Uhhhh... bit longer, I'd say? I experienced an annoyingly high encounter rate in Lodestone, which is why I'd consider it about a 5.5/10 on the dungeon length scale";;
Rasea#1840;29-Sep-18 09:10 PM;"I'd say Tower of Zot is a bit higher in length. The encounter rate is more balanced, but there's several floors and a good amount of treasure to get";;

Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 01:02 AM;"Generally speaking, a white mage without offense is worse than a black mage without support. So going for offense first is ideal so you have give support jobs a form of offense later";;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 01:02 AM;As well as investing 30 ABP into the blue mage class to get that ever useful blue magic command;;

wallac#1653;30-Sep-18 01:03 AM;Blue mage or black mage?;;
wallac#1653;30-Sep-18 01:03 AM;Clearly I should wait on white mage;;
wallac#1653;30-Sep-18 01:05 AM;Also galuf is an OP monk;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 01:07 AM;"I'd say work on blue mage for everyone to get the !Learning ability. Only takes 30 ABP. After that, you'll obviously want someone to be a white mage.

Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 01:10 AM;"Additionally, a neat little thing for that point in the game is that if you invest 45 ABP in Monk for Barehanded, allowing you to forgo weapons entirely on any class you switch over to since it gives you a whopping +26 strength";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Sep-18 09:27 PM;"It's umm... complicated, to put it simply.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 09:29 PM;"You have the basics in combat like Attack, Magic, GF (which is Summon) and Items";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Sep-18 09:33 PM;Which you need to junction GFs to your party before you can *equip* the abilities (besides Attack);;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 09:33 PM;"Unlike using materia in VIII to use magic, you need to draw magic and stock it in order to use it";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Sep-18 09:33 PM;I like it. It’s a fun game.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 09:34 PM;"I like it too. A lot of people just don't like taking time to draw the magic, but I don't mind it";;
wallac#1653;30-Sep-18 09:42 PM;Uh I'm having troubles getting to karnak;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Sep-18 09:42 PM;I like triple triad. And i like that it’s a really productive mini game;;
wallac#1653;30-Sep-18 09:42 PM;I've tried flying and I can't get around the mountains nor do i see a pathway;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 09:46 PM;You have to fly to the meteorite using your Wind Drake and then go inside of it and step on a special looking tile;;

Nezar 凶#5027;30-Sep-18 09:53 PM;Triple Triad is fun as hell.;;
Nezar 凶#5027;30-Sep-18 09:53 PM;That's all you need to break the game.;;
Nezar 凶#5027;30-Sep-18 09:53 PM;Nothing else.;;
Perrydice#9311;30-Sep-18 09:55 PM;My issue is that Triple Triad slows the game's pacing down quite a bit and it requires more resetting than the Chocobo breeding in 7.;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 09:56 PM;Nothing's more fun than a swift kick to the nuts of pacing;;

Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:52 PM;"Oh, I wanted to ask for help haha";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:52 PM;Because I'm stuck at a boss fight which is hard af;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:53 PM;And somehow I think my game is possibly glitching;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Sep-18 10:54 PM;I have not played that game because the general opinion of it was that it was just as crappy as Setsuna;;

Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:56 PM;"But just get this, **for some reason** when one of my characters attack the boss, the damage he inflicts on the boss is also inflicted upon him";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:56 PM;Which is **not** supposed to happen;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:56 PM;"And no, the boss does not have such abilities";;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 10:56 PM;"If you tell me what the boss is, I could look it up for you if you're not wanting to use google/guides/whathaveyou 👀";;

wolfgamer1990#8421;30-Sep-18 10:57 PM;@Izwar Vain#5689 is it your weapons your using?;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 10:57 PM;Ah;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:57 PM;"No the weird thing is, it didn't occur the first time I fought her, the first fight there was no such thing";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:58 PM;Only from the second fight onwards suddenly this thing happened;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 10:59 PM;Weapon? I don't think there's a self-damaging weapon in this game;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 11:00 PM;"So I googled it, and someone mentioned a Paragon artifact? Some bosses/mobs reflect certain types of elemental damage as well evidently";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:00 PM;WHAT;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 11:01 PM;Shouldn't be that big of a deal o.o;;

Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:02 PM;It may really be a bug;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:02 PM;Wtf;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 11:03 PM;🤔;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:04 PM;No no no no no okay this is too funny;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:06 PM;Okay so this is the wording of what the Paragon artifact's effect is: Deal extra damage when target's resistance to that attack type is high.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:07 PM;"So when you read it, you would understand it as, when you attack a monster with high resistance to your attack type, **YOU** deal more damage";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:07 PM;"But *APPARENTLY*, it actually means, you **take** damage";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:07 PM;Nice wording Sqaure Enix;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:08 PM;Let me speak with your translator please;;
Rasea#1840;30-Sep-18 11:08 PM;Sooooo what is the point of the artifact then;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:08 PM;Right? Bs;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Sep-18 11:09 PM;Nothing really except it gives advantage to the enemies for some reason;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 12:30 PM;"So, for the most part: Original or bust";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 12:33 PM;Lol. Sorta.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 12:34 PM;"I think that GBA FFV and FFVI are good games but the sound quality isn't phenomenal. I prefer the writing of GBA VI over the SNES version, but the sound is just better on the SNES. The Steam versions of V and VI are a waste of cash. The Steam versions of VII and IX are good. The PSP version of IV is good (I prefer the DS remake). I like the DS remake of III but the job transitions is pretty damn annoying.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 12:35 PM;"For FF1, I pretty much like every version of the game. I agree that the NES is probably the least favorite for a lot of people, but I think it's still awesome.";;
Danny#3275;04-Oct-18 01:41 PM;"Sorry but FFXV is far superior on Steam lol, PC gaming allows for better customizations and the graphics and scenery are next level. I love Playstation but it just can't match a PC.";;

Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:46 PM;I also disagree with FFV. FFV isn't as artfully done as VI. It doesn't have the amazing backgrounds or art. Or character models that are designed well and also move when you do. And also V doesn't suffer really from the brightening of the world like VI does since V's story is relatively lighthearted;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:46 PM;"Or, well, not taken as seriously as most FF stories take themselves";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 01:56 PM;It must be a blast to work with him;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 01:56 PM;Like he doesn't give a fuck about anything lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 01:57 PM;Probably throws parties in the office on a daily basis;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:01 PM;"Well, let's see., , 1) FF7 Crisis Core would be considered major and probably his best game (but that was 11 years ago), 2) FF Type-0 would be another, but it's a sideline game without any brand power like FF7 has, so not sure if it really counts (and also kinda eh), 3) FF15, 4) FF Dissidia NT";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:01 PM;He just needs five more to reach his miracle;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:01 PM;Remove T0;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:02 PM;Also crap;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:02 PM;"Crap or not wouldn't omit as being a major title, but fair enough";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:02 PM;True;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:02 PM;I didn't even know it existed until it got some remaster or something and I saw it in a magazine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:02 PM;Ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:03 PM;Yeah it was like literally one of the last PSP games;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:03 PM;Used 2 UMDs;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:03 PM;Jeez o.o;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:04 PM;"Though evidently, Japan adored Type-0 for some reason";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:04 PM;Just looked into it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:05 PM;They're nicer than us muricans;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:05 PM;Lmao;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:05 PM;Or westerners;;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 02:05 PM;"it didn't do anything for me. i didn't play it, but i watched a youtuber for a bit of playthrough and thought it looked dull";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:05 PM;I assume it's some cultural thing since they've liked aspects of games we hate and vice versa;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:06 PM;Like them adoring Yuffie but a good majority of westerners hating her;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:06 PM;Yeah;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:06 PM;Or Japan loving... uh... the FE character stereotype of royalty or one that knows their place;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:06 PM;As opposed to Roy or whatshisface that is the adventurer that makes a name for himself that westerners like but Japan hates;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 02:12 PM;I wonder what Japan thinks of the current state of FF;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:15 PM;It appears most of the criticism came from the west;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:15 PM;"For XV, anyways";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:16 PM;XIII also got high ratings from Japan as well;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:20 PM;I fucking hate Yuffie;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:20 PM;I want to stab her in the ear.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:20 PM;That's aggressive;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:20 PM;"Yeah, it's been a rough day.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:21 PM;I took a break to go run some nonsense errands and literally FAILED ON EVERY SINGLE ONE.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:21 PM;Aw >: That blows;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:21 PM;"Yeah, oh well. I'll take it out on Yuffie.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:22 PM;NO YOU WON'T;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:22 PM;🛡;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:22 PM;Then who?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:22 PM;I will defend her;;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 02:22 PM;then you must duel to the death;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:22 PM;Take it out on Quina;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:25 PM;Fine;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:26 PM;So in FFX... Its' obviously a lot different from the styles I've been playing. Will there be hidden chests and shit?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:27 PM;Or does it turn into more of an open-world run of the mill game?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:27 PM;Is there a big exploration part to it?;;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 02:28 PM;"you'll be able to explore the locations that you go through, you just won't have an open world map";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:29 PM;so pretty linear?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:30 PM;I totally just bought it for PS4 so I can have crossplay with Vita.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 02:30 PM;Not as linear as XIII;;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 02:30 PM;"from a world map perspective, yes. but you'll still have a lot more interaction than XIII";;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 02:30 PM;you'll still have hidden chests and things like that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:30 PM;"I'm only familiar with 1, 4, 6, 7, 8";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:31 PM;"It's fairly linear, yeah. You're mostly running through areas the entire time, but you get some neat segments. As for chests, most are obvious, but they hide chests by using the forced camera angles to put them beyond objects or people";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 02:31 PM;Akin to how 7 would sometimes do with materia;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:31 PM;ah;;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 02:31 PM;or pre-7 they would do by having items in pots;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:31 PM;"ha, yeah.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:31 PM;or in bushes like in IV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:36 PM;"Hmm. Once I finish IV, I think I might head to X... either that or Chrono Trigger.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:36 PM;I know CT will end up being one of my favorite games so I've kinda been saving it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:38 PM;I'm guessing I'm like 2/3rds of the way through IV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:39 PM;@Perrydice#9311 What are you thoughts on X? You and I are similar in our FF tastes except for VIII.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:40 PM;The gameplay is a ton of fun.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:40 PM;How hard will I struggle?;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:40 PM;It's not too bad.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:40 PM;I don't think you'll struggle too much.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:40 PM;"Ha, ok.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:41 PM;"I went for it because of the crossplay. The more options I have to play on, the better.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:41 PM;"Just like the story in IV, I think X has kind of a dumb story overall.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:41 PM;But X is super fun.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 02:41 PM;word;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:42 PM;"IV has a story that is easy to follow, but man, it's pretty damn tropy.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:00 PM;`You won't struggle too much` Seymour Flux says hi;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:04 PM;He said *too much*;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:06 PM;That fucker is the bane of my existence;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:07 PM;I didn't say the game didn't have asshole bosses.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:11 PM;"I wouldn't say asshole. He's entirely fair, and I don't think there's any actually dififcult bosses in the past earlier FF games. In my experience, anyways";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:12 PM;"Chaos is thankfully fitting. That Soul Cannon thing I just fought in FFV (replaying it, so I had just forgotten about it) is nice since it actually takes more than three turns to kill and can definitely kill you";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:12 PM;Carrier Armor and Demon's gate say hello;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:12 PM;I don't know those 🤔;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:13 PM;Ff7;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:13 PM;All I'm gonna say;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:13 PM;"Oh, those two";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:13 PM;Carrier Armor was a pushover for reasons I can't recall. Think I did too much damage for its usual this boss is actually pretty hard bits to get to me;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:13 PM;"Demon's Gate was... decent difficulty, but nothing on the upper ranges";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:19 PM;9 has one if you choose to do the fight legit;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:19 PM;Hint: he's undead;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:23 PM;Every FF has at least one difficult boss;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:23 PM;Except for the original NA SNES version of IV.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:25 PM;Like the CPU might give you some trouble and maybe the Evil Wall but that's like it. Even Zeromus is easy... the only thing is he doesn't go down in one turn.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:26 PM;And they are not hard.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:26 PM;I keep on forgetting IV was a snes title;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:28 PM;"V, Shinryu is an asshole. VI, Magic Master is an asshole if you don't know to caste Life 3 on all characters.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:31 PM;"Final Fantasy 1 on the NES, it was really the journey to the bosses that sucked. The Cockatrices suck and the Sorcerers are the biggest assholes in the game, period.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 03:36 PM;magic master in VI... which boss was he? Top of the cult tower?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:36 PM;"FF Ii Emperor, final fight";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 03:36 PM;And ye;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:38 PM;I guess I have to count FF2 ~~even if it's designed like crap.~~ Though I'm sure that Blink + Osmose + Berserk strategy I looked at does a pretty good job of trivializing her;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:39 PM;Haven't gotten far in VI so I can't comment there. Though I thought that boss in... *looks it up*;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:40 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Yes.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:42 PM;"Number 128 in Vector. Had some trouble with him, which is unexpected since that's still somewhat early. The Ifrit & Shiva fight there as well also kicks your ass without proper preparation";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 03:43 PM;oh that was really earlky;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 03:43 PM;early;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 03:43 PM;"damn, I cant really remember that fight. I know the area and I remember the Ifrit/Shiva fight";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 03:43 PM;but 128... not so much;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:45 PM;"He has some strong attacks, looks blue and ugly. Has Left Blade & Right Blade that can be killed but allow 128 to use some powerful attacks if they're killed and they also regenerate";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 03:46 PM;Has the Tempest sword as a rare steal;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 03:48 PM;Yeah that is early. I was able to get that Tempest steal. It's good if you can get it but it's not necessary.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 04:17 PM;for Cyan?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 04:18 PM;Yup;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:15 PM;I might just start FFX on PS4 now. It's right in my home office. I have some downtime over the next week on the work front.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:19 PM;Dooooooo eeeeeeet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:20 PM;I can just sit here... play it for an hour (or 4)... pick up the phone when needed...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:21 PM;Anything i should know before I start (spoiler free of course)?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:21 PM;I'll play mostly blind.;;

Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:21 PM;"\;)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:21 PM;IV has been a lot of fun blind;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:21 PM;"Yeah, I always opt for the original over the remake.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:22 PM;Pretty much it;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:22 PM;"Ah, and don't bother with Kimahri";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:22 PM;I opted for the original music in IV over the remade sountrack;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:22 PM;It's actually better if you don't level him up;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:22 PM;ok;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:23 PM;I'm looking to explore and have fun... but not going to do ALL the optional stuff;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:23 PM;"like I said, blind. So I'm sure I'll miss a bunch";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:23 PM;"Just to make sure, there is **one** part you have to use him";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:23 PM;"You might consider leveling him up, but don't";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:24 PM;I'll just play organically on that front;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:25 PM;Why Bienfu? Is it because that fight involves them doing percentage based damage or something?;;
FireProne#0537;04-Oct-18 07:54 PM;Is it true that after years is technically the same game as IV but redone with different characters and story and is not really worth playing?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 07:58 PM;"It's the best sequel in the FF series, but that's not saying much considering";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 07:59 PM;"You have that whole lunar cycle thing that messes with magic potency which some people like, but I didn't find it terribly interesting after a few hours so I just put it down";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Oct-18 08:28 PM;"Nah, the best FF sequel in Advent Children Complete";;
Untinkered#1422;04-Oct-18 09:03 PM;Is After Years any good though? Never tried it;;
Wyatt#6999;04-Oct-18 09:04 PM;I heard it wasnt. but i havent played it;;
pokemongenius#1474;04-Oct-18 10:20 PM;Its not great mostly for being broken up in small chunks rather than one large story. We also dont talk about the Crystals tale cuzz it sucks.;;
Untinkered#1422;04-Oct-18 10:31 PM;Oh. It's episodic.;;
Wyatt#6999;04-Oct-18 10:33 PM;ew;;
Untinkered#1422;04-Oct-18 10:33 PM;Yep. Big turn off.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:38 PM;Crystals tale is actual good part wat;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:39 PM;"I said this before, had TAY been the original FFIV, it would've been a far better game than the original ever was.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:40 PM;"The shortcoming was that they put too much time into rehashing scenarios from the original game that it just feels like a drag to retread the same world, the same maps, enemies, bosses, etc... all over again";;
Untinkered#1422;04-Oct-18 10:58 PM;Well. I think I'll give it a try after I finish my current playthrough of FFVI Brave New World. I liked IV when I first played it. Haven't replayed it though. So I guess giving After Years a try would be fair.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:59 PM;as long as you have not played IV in any recent point in time you'll be fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:00 PM;otherwise I advise against it because it will feel like you're playing the same game twice;;
Untinkered#1422;04-Oct-18 11:20 PM;"I see. So it's not really a sequel. Also, which version do you recommend?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:22 PM;PSP version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:24 PM;also it is a sequel it's just that the game rehashes events that appeared previously in the first game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:25 PM;and despite that the time gap between the two games is 18 years(in story terms) all of the maps are exactly the same;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:25 PM;same music aside from a few new tracks most of which you won't hear until the end of the game;;
Wyatt#6999;04-Oct-18 11:26 PM;so its one of those cheapo rehashing resources sequels?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:26 PM;pretty much;;
Wyatt#6999;04-Oct-18 11:26 PM;😕;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:26 PM;and if the original game never existed it would've been a better game but unfortunately that's not the case here;;
Untinkered#1422;04-Oct-18 11:27 PM;I'll give it a try then. Thanks;;

Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 07:05 AM;"I thought FFIV:TAY was a repeat of the first game. I just think that if you are going to make a sequel, it needs to be a new story, not the same story with different names.";;
Untinkered#1422;05-Oct-18 10:04 AM;So it's a remake/sequel/spin-off?;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 10:11 AM;It's a sequel. 18 years into the future.;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 10:14 AM;"I played it not that long ago because, despite my issues with the story, I enjoyed Final Fantasy IV. I think it's a very good game overall.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Oct-18 11:16 AM;I really like IV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Oct-18 11:16 AM;maybe my favorite behind VI;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Oct-18 11:17 AM;Story is pretty basic... but it's not terrible compared to the usual FF tropes;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 11:30 AM;I really did not like how they handled the main bad guy in FFIV. It's very similar to how they handled FFIII.;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 11:31 AM;I also don't like how they overuse the mind controlled trope. They overuse it so much that it's annoying.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 11:32 AM;Spoilers mate;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 11:32 AM;thank ya;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 11:32 AM;that moment can be a big deal for some;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 11:32 AM;Fair enough.;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 11:33 AM;"But, like @Santa Filthy Casual#9506 said, it is a basic story that is easy to follow.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 11:34 AM;"Basic, yeah, but it still has spoilerly moments";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Oct-18 11:34 AM;"yeah, i just got to the underworld";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Oct-18 11:34 AM;so I'm not done yet;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:27 PM;All one can do is spout vapid theories about it;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:27 PM;They should at *least* owe a explanation;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:28 PM;They don't;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:29 PM;"Source code is the only real explanation. Some argue the rights to Eyes On Me, but that makes little sense as it would've been taken down from Steam if that were the case";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:29 PM;Well i'd rather not see theories about it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:29 PM;"Even if they did lose the source code, they allegedly lost the source code for KH1, but that didn't stop them from making Final Mix/1.5 (or was it 3D?)";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:30 PM;"Some also argue popularity, given that it's eclipsed by 7 & 9, but that still wouldn't make much sense as it's still a FF game and would sell";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:30 PM;How did they even lose the source code in the first place;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:30 PM;The only other thing I can think of is the 20th anniversary for it next year and they're waiting for that;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:31 PM;Apparently it wasn't a common practice to keep old code;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:31 PM;Yep;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:31 PM;No one thought we should keep the code to remaster the game in 10-15 years on new systems at the time;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:31 PM;I guess its wise to archive the source codes?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:31 PM;"Also, 9 was eclipsed by 10 *twice*";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:31 PM;"10 was also on PS2, not PS1 :P";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:32 PM;True but still;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:32 PM;"And yeah, you want to archive it in case it's needed for some reason again";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:32 PM;How they could lose KH1's source code is beyond me;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:32 PM;"KH is still a niche series, but it was still pretty popular and on PS2, no less";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;"Again, allegedly";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;Sigh;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;-shrug-;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;"This might be dumb but, can't they just get a ROM from the internet?";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;"And just, do the work from there?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;Maybe;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;I... am actually curious about that;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;Time to ask my super nerd coding friend;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;~~didn't stop Nintendo~~;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:33 PM;"But uh, here's the thing though";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:34 PM;"The ROM is just the complete game, and im assuming the source code was just all over the place when they had it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:34 PM;ROMs would contain compiled code;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:34 PM;That's *not* source code;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:34 PM;"Also, if they did lose the code, how did they upload the game onto Steam? Or am I missing something here?";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:34 PM;"Huh, so I was right";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:34 PM;Yeah I thought this over about the ROM thing;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:35 PM;"When they had the source code, it wasn't all in one place, it was like pieces";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:35 PM;It's possible (although I don't know about this) that the Steam version is a PS1 ISO packaged in a modified emulator;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:35 PM;Although I highly doubt it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:35 PM;"Also, *losing* data happens";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:35 PM;It was most likely an accident for KH1;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:35 PM;"Well 8, like 7, did have an original PC release";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:36 PM;"Oh yeah, you're right";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:36 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:36 PM;Guess we'll have no choice but to wait until something happens;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:37 PM;Odd they only stopped at 8;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:37 PM;Originally;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:37 PM;I got confused a year ago when it wasn't on the App Store;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:37 PM;"Now im here, talking about it with other people";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:38 PM;"But yeah, my guess is Eyes On Me or saving something for the 20th year anniversary";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:39 PM;As for why it's on steam: Original PC release;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:40 PM;"Oh whoops, I forgot that 8 was on the PC lol";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:40 PM;I brought it up like a minute ago;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:40 PM;Dumb dumb;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:40 PM;Discord was being shite;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:41 PM;"Sigh, do they HAVE the source code on the PC version?";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:41 PM;That's not how it works;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Oct-18 02:42 PM;"Also, personally, I'm fine without a remaster cause I have a modded version of 8";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:42 PM;How does it work then;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:42 PM;"Sorry im not that informed about stuff like this, cause I usually don't give two shits";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:43 PM;"But now its getting my attention, and i'd like to hear it";;

Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:43 PM;Gen;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:43 PM;~~speak of the devil~~;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:43 PM;Code is something you can read;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:43 PM;"```cpp, #include <iostream>, , int main() {,     std::cout << Hello! << std::endl;, ,     return 0;, }, ```";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:44 PM;"When you compile this, it turns into an exe file that shows `Hello!` on the screen";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:44 PM;colors!;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:44 PM;If you try to open the exe file with the notepad you won't be able to read anything;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:44 PM;So you have to use a different program?;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:44 PM;Because compiling code means translating that pile of code you can read into what a computer can read;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:45 PM;Basically into binary;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:45 PM;It's borderline unreadable to a human;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:45 PM;Trying to do the reverse operation is nearly impossible;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:45 PM;"Ahh, I get it now";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:46 PM;Thanks for the mini-lesson;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:46 PM;You Wiz;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:47 PM;"Anyway, there's a chance Square did indeed lose the source code";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:47 PM;But it's highly unlikely;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:47 PM;I'd say they're just trying to forget the game existed and not bother wasting money porting it;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;Are they even aware that there's probably a majority or a handful of dudes out there that enjoyed it?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;lol a majority;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;I'd say the people who actually want to replay it are the minority;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;They wouldn't care if there was;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;If the minority is louder;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:49 PM;"Hold on, they rereleased II, right?";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:49 PM;They remade it;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:49 PM;For better or for worse?;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;Well... a lot better;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;Which isn't saying much;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;But it's still not great;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;It's the same game at its core;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;I think they were trying to make people enjoy it;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;"I think they also outsourced the remake, so";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;"Oh, I was just wondering";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;05-Oct-18 02:51 PM;"Sigh, like I said before, guess we'll have to wait";;

Marcello#4574;06-Oct-18 07:14 PM;That's now in an isometric view;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:26 PM;So like VII?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:27 PM;Or at least like a good deal of it?;;

Marcello#4574;06-Oct-18 07:30 PM;VII isn't isometric;;
Marcello#4574;06-Oct-18 07:30 PM;Tactics *kinda* is from what I remember;;
Marcello#4574;06-Oct-18 07:30 PM;It might be something close to isometric;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;06-Oct-18 07:30 PM;it is isometric;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:38 PM;Is VII not isometric because the backgrounds are fixed?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 07:39 PM;It's not isometric because there is perspective;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:41 PM;Why is that not considered isometric?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 07:41 PM;Angle's too low to be isometric I'd say;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:42 PM;That seems vague;;
Marcello#4574;06-Oct-18 07:42 PM;It looks isometric;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 07:42 PM;"I doubt it is, tho";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 07:42 PM;But I can't say without the coordinate axes visible;;
Marcello#4574;06-Oct-18 07:43 PM;Perhaps the z axis angle is wrong to be a full isometric model on computing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 07:43 PM;I don't think the X and Y axis are on a 120° angle either;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:55 PM;Do the angles have to be exact?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 07:56 PM;They don’t have to be exact according to the Wikipedia article you linked.;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 08:04 PM;"But honestly, it's hard to say from just a picture";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 08:04 PM;"In any case, that's one room of many in the game, isn't it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Oct-18 08:05 PM;"Most of the game definitely isn't isometric, from what I remember";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 08:19 PM;There are a lot of similar rooms though. With similar perspective.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 08:20 PM;Why is it hard to say from a picture?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Oct-18 08:20 PM;And one angle is “off?” That doesn’t matter.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Oct-18 02:13 PM;I just like to know if the dungeon is going to be a pain in the ass or if there are any missables that I really don’t want to miss.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;07-Oct-18 02:13 PM;Like the moogle charm in VI.;;
Rasea#1840;07-Oct-18 02:15 PM;"Uh, no unique equipment other than the ice related stuff which is pretty good for this point in the game";;

ABYSSWALKER-02#0269;11-Oct-18 08:10 PM;Easy and hard;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-18 11:56 AM;Rikku cause she's not Lightning;;
Untinkered#1422;12-Oct-18 12:05 PM;So not lightning;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-18 12:16 PM;That's what I said;;

Perrydice#9311;12-Oct-18 04:26 PM;"@qlip#0001 Umm.... it's okay. I am also a fan of the classic gameplay.  With the exception of 12, I really don't like the modern FF games that much.";;

Nobuo#3856;12-Oct-18 09:05 PM;they can make a mod for it to use the classic formula;;

Wyatt#6999;13-Oct-18 09:32 PM;I have a quick final fantasy question;;
Wyatt#6999;13-Oct-18 09:34 PM;"ok so I was under the impression that you -had- to collect all 13 weapons in XV to beat the bad guy or whatever, but like its optional apparently? why even introduce it then? are you supposed to get only the storyline required ones or what? I just dont know what the deal with all that is. very weird";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Oct-18 09:34 PM;It's just a  sidequest that's interlinked with the main story is all;;
Wyatt#6999;13-Oct-18 09:35 PM;oh... I dont know why it bugs me so much;;
Wyatt#6999;13-Oct-18 09:35 PM;its like we must get the weapons its your birthright but canonically they're half-assed about it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Oct-18 09:35 PM;Yeah the whole thing's weird about it;;
Wyatt#6999;13-Oct-18 09:36 PM;it felt pretty good demolishing the bad guy with all my hard-obtained weapons though;;
Rasea#1840;13-Oct-18 09:45 PM;"Yeah, that really bugged me";;
Rasea#1840;13-Oct-18 09:46 PM;"Since they gave off the impression that you had to be all Noctis, you need all 13 weapons and enter that super special form in order to be able to beat Ardyn";;
Rasea#1840;13-Oct-18 09:46 PM;"But nah, plot powers say otherwise";;
Wyatt#6999;13-Oct-18 09:57 PM;"yeah exactly, it was really weird";;

Izwar Vain#5689;14-Oct-18 01:38 AM;"I would, if the Geomancer class in FFTA had actual good skills";;
Deep#9598;14-Oct-18 03:31 AM;"The geomancer I found a bit situational in 5. In 3, it was broken";;
Deep#9598;14-Oct-18 03:34 AM;I like it in concept;;
Brion#4623;14-Oct-18 05:28 AM;I love the geomancer in 3 and tactics;;
Faris#9717;14-Oct-18 06:11 AM;There's no Geomancer in FFTA..;;
Izwar Vain#5689;14-Oct-18 07:13 AM;"Okay, not FFTA, FFTA2";;
Wyatt#6999;14-Oct-18 10:30 AM;"I like it in theory, but in practice its a little iffy";;
Rasea#1840;14-Oct-18 12:11 PM;"I can't speak for Geomancer in anything but FFV. In that case, Geomancers exist purely for !Gaia to give mages a way to attack without expending MP. As far as the concept of Geo goes (using abilites based on terrain), I think it'll always be iffy/situational";;
Rasea#1840;14-Oct-18 12:13 PM;"Even if you made it better by giving the player a selection of abilities based on the terrain and let them choose from it. Such as going, >Select Gaia, >On grass lands, >Pick from one of four abilities available on grassland terrain, It'd still be iffy because it's based on the terrain you're on, so it'd end up being more powerful than magic or not worth using based on the terrain";;
pokemongenius#1474;14-Oct-18 03:15 PM;Cave In says hi;;
Rasea#1840;14-Oct-18 04:22 PM;Oh you mean Mog's dances which are complete RNG that you can't control either?;;
Rasea#1840;14-Oct-18 04:23 PM;"Yeah, that's completely different";;
Deep#9598;14-Oct-18 04:34 PM;"Geomancer becomes really iffy when you take into account that it may prioritise the specific element of the terrain you're in, and you're in, say, the fire dungeon. The majority of the enemies in the dungeon are going to resist or absorb fire";;
Brion#4623;14-Oct-18 05:35 PM;it's also risky  when you're on a boss and it tries to use some instant death ability that they are immune to;;
ChipNoir#3597;14-Oct-18 07:55 PM;"Basically yeah, it should always be a secondary ability if at all.";;
ChipNoir#3597;14-Oct-18 07:55 PM;"Though if it comes down to saving MP, Dance offers better results for equally 0 cost.";;
Brion#4623;15-Oct-18 02:46 PM;i really liked it in ff3. i killed bahamut at a much lower level than i should have because i got lucky RNG on what it cast and hit him with 9999 damage 3 turns in a row;;
Brion#4623;15-Oct-18 02:56 PM;"i'd say in 5 geomancer didn't feel as strong. find pits was occasionally useful, but summoner, mystic knight, and time mage were all stronger at the magic damage/utility combat role";;
Deep#9598;15-Oct-18 03:04 PM;"I chose to use a geomancer at the time of, uh, that one dungeon. It's the one that recommends you use a scholar because the boss changed its weakness. Got into the fight, the geomancer used the most powerful geomancer spell in the pool and killed the guy in one go. I'd changed Arc to a scholar, too";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Oct-18 10:35 AM;how far through it am I if I am in Luca tracking down Yuna who was kidnapped just before the blitzball tourney?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Oct-18 10:35 AM;generally speaking;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Oct-18 10:35 AM;10%? 15%? Those were my guesses;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;17-Oct-18 11:39 AM;"Gil is precious to me, even in post game";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;17-Oct-18 11:39 AM;let's say zanmato occurs about 70% of the time for me;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;17-Oct-18 11:39 AM;Gil is not that hard to get;;
Brion#4623;17-Oct-18 11:39 AM;i was so confused. i didn't notice the name difference at first;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;17-Oct-18 11:39 AM;I've read it depends on how often you use him;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;17-Oct-18 11:44 AM;so it's entirely up to him;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Oct-18 11:48 AM;i think they block my path going one way;;

Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:02 AM;The smaller of the two wandering tortoises on the archylte steppe;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:02 AM;well fuck;;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:02 AM;What's your team setup like?;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:04 AM;"lightning, hope and fang";;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:06 AM;"The popular trio, that's good";;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:07 AM;"Beating chapter 11 doesn't require *that* much grinding, but they stick you on Gran Pulse with a whole ton of exploration and missions for a reason";;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:07 AM;"Providing you can hold your own, the chapter 11 boss shouldn't be that much of an issue";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:10 AM;yeah fair enough. just feels like i've been grinding for quite a while and i haven't even got their main roles maxed out yet;;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:11 AM;That's fair. Have you been using the behemoth/giant lobo encounter to grind?;;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:13 AM;"That tends to be one of the easier ways to grind cp. Alternatively, the adamanchelid gives out... 4500, if I remember";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:19 AM;im currently doing behemoth king but before i was focused on missions and just using the encounters i found on the way to the target;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:20 AM;"Despite its popularity, Light/Hope/Fang is an ill equipped team for most of Chapter 11";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:20 AM;i'll try the adamanchelid again soon to see how far away i am from being able to defeat it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:20 AM;I'd argue it's the second worst team without wilful grinding;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:20 AM;really?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:20 AM;Yeah;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:20 AM;what would you suggest then?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:21 AM;It's an extremely defensive team in a gane better played offensively;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:21 AM;Better as in more fun and more optimal;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:21 AM;I recommend not sticking to one single team;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:22 AM;But Sazh is a magnificent addition to any team;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:22 AM;"He has Haste, has all the offensive buffs already, and is decent at his roles";;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:23 AM;"The downside with Sazh is that his offensive stats are not as great as other characters, and his attacking animations take a bit longer than others";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:25 AM;hmmmm;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:25 AM;"True, Sazh is a character that is way better manually controlled in his three roles, which is unique, I believe";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:26 AM;Using the AI/Auto (same thing technically) is for Sazh is a way bigger loss of power with Sazh than with any other character;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:27 AM;"Especially conpared to Snow or Lightning at this point in the game, for example";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:27 AM;I'd give more details and advice if I were on my computer;;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:27 AM;"Since Sazh backsteps all the time with his attack animation, it's actually possible to miss the target from a longer distance since his bullets are considered projectiles";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:28 AM;"That's fairly rare, because *maintaining* that distance requires a conscious effort";;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:28 AM;True;;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 05:29 AM;"Although it can happen often if you're fighting, say, a cactuar";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:29 AM;"And it's a very valuable defensive asset, being able to back up";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:29 AM;"Yeah, but Cactuars are easily missed by most characters anyway";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:30 AM;For various reasons;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:30 AM;Pesky little shit;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:34 AM;Fuck touchscreens;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:34 AM;"Alright, as I said, sticking to a team will likely lead to trouble";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:35 AM;"Considering every character gets CP, you don't lose anything switching the team around";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:35 AM;"As for the characters, here are their strengths and weaknesses for Chapter 11";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:36 AM;"Lightning starts to severely fall off at this point, when included in balanced (offense/defense) teams, because she's a horrendous MED, but in offensive teams, she's a good character, thanks to high stats, fast animations, and being a good RAV";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:38 AM;"Hope is a very defensive character at this point. The only offensive buffs he gets without massive grinding are the en-spells, which double your damage... against the right enemies. He's a good RAV, and an exceptional MED, especially once you get Curaja and Curasa";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:40 AM;"Vanille is a strong offensive character. Her access to offensive debuffs gives her a lot of offensive potential, and her MED is nothing to scoff at, although her animations are a bit slower than Hope's, which makes her barely inferior to him in RAV and MED";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:42 AM;"Sazh is an offensive powerhouse in Chapter 11, but has to be manually controlled for him to shine. In COM, using Blitz instead of Attack has to be done manually, and the damage compensates for his low stats. In RAV, manual control allows you to avoid the AI's alternating of spells and -strikes, and manual control of SYN allows you to prioritize buffs optimally";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:43 AM;"Snow is an all-rounder, and is the only character to be good at ALL six Roles. In Chapter 11, he balances good stats and *amazing* animation speed to be a good COM and RAV, and is the best SEN bar none";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:44 AM;"Fang is an odd case. Used right, she's terrifying. Used poorly she doesn't bring much. Fang shines mostly in late and post-game. This is due to her SAB spells in Chapter 11 requiring advanced knowledge to be exploited properly, and SEN being a hard Role to use optimally";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:45 AM;hmmm;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:45 AM;firstly;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:45 AM;thank you for typing all that;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:46 AM;Do you want team suggestions for various situations ?;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:46 AM;yes please!! if you don't mind;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:46 AM;Sure;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:47 AM;"First, I just want to point out that what I think is the strongest team at this point is borderline unusable in a first playthrough";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:47 AM;"As it is Fang/Snow/Sazh, and it has no MED";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:47 AM;Not for the faint of heart;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:47 AM;"also i'm not very good at manually controlling characters because i have add and my processing speed isn't fast enough to think about what i need to do, which is why i'm hesitant about sazh";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:47 AM;yeah lmao i definitelt couldn't do that;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:47 AM;"Well, for his RAV and COM, you have the Repeat button";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:48 AM;"That way you only have to manually input something once or twice in the fight, and can repeat them";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:48 AM;"Buffs are another matter, tho";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:48 AM;Don't hesitate to pause juste to think;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:48 AM;I've played 600 hours and still do it 👀;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:49 AM;"But once you get used to the spells positions, and you get better at going through the menu, it'll be fun";;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 05:50 AM;Wow!;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:50 AM;"Putting offensive buffs manually isn't very complicated, because you can do it in the same order and it works okay";;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 05:51 AM;"This was such valuable information, thank you!";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:51 AM;👍;;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 05:51 AM;I was stuck on the Gran Pulse too and I just gave up;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:51 AM;Gran Pulse is definitely a slight difficulty spike;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:51 AM;Amplified if you go past the Steppes without doing Missions at all;;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 05:52 AM;But I was using the LVF team so I guess that explains why;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:52 AM;THe game expects you to master the combat at this point;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:52 AM;"Unfortunately, it does a *horrid* job at teaching it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:52 AM;LFV is alright;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:53 AM;At least it has Vanille's debuffs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:53 AM;"Like, LHF has *no* offensive tools";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:53 AM;Every fight is a slog with that team;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:54 AM;"Not without grinding for those tools, which come really late, at least";;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 05:54 AM;Should I spend my CP on multiple classes (whatever they're called) or is it okay if I just stick to one per character?;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:54 AM;maybe thats why its been so slow for me;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:54 AM;That's why it's so common to hear fights take ages;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:55 AM;Because the most popular team causes fights to take ages;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:55 AM;I can take down the boss of Chapter 11 now faster than I could take down random enemies back when I first played;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 05:56 AM;"Hard to say, Izwar";;

lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 05:59 AM;"@Izwar Vain#5689 i, obviously not an expert considering this is my first playthrough, do think it's good to try to level up multiple roles (classes) but only the main 3 they were assigned in the beginning. at this point i'm not gonna bother with the others until postgame";;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 06:02 AM;"Hmmm, it's just that now that all the classes are available for each character, it's kinda too much for me";;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 06:03 AM;That's why I'm just too lazy to care about other classes and just stick to one per char lmao;;
Izwar Vain#5689;18-Oct-18 06:03 AM;But I obviously need to fix that;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:07 AM;true;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:13 AM;"Focusing on the three main Roles for now, I'd say it's good to focus on a single Role at a time, but only until you've gotten the key abilities from that Role";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:15 AM;"Pushing further costs a lot more CP, and only gives stats (while non-negligible, it's far less important)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:15 AM;"In COM, getting Ruinga (and Blitz for poor, late-to-the-Blitz-party Snow)";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:15 AM;yeah i only try to get the hp stats;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:16 AM;"Ruinga is immensely powerful, because it can launch weaker enemies, and combined with Vigilance even medium enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:16 AM;Meaning you can lockdown entire groups of enemies by throwing Ruingas constantly;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:16 AM;While dealing respectable damage if buffed correctly;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:17 AM;"In RAV, -ra spells are nice to have for bosses, but -ga spells are very good to have for groups of enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:17 AM;"For the same reason as Ruinga, RAV -ga spells Launch enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:18 AM;"SEN is a lower priority Role, but it gets a few nice passive abilities at this point";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:18 AM;"It also gives more HP than other roles, for character who are SENs";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:19 AM;"Everything is important in a SYN, but rushing to get the spells isn't necessary, because you don't get new spells in Chapter 11, only more spells on a character";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:19 AM;"(Sazh starts to get some of Hope's buffs, and vice-versa)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:20 AM;"SAB *single-target* debuffs are really good to have, especially the ones Fang can get, if used well";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:20 AM;It's preferable to ignore the AoE debuffs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:21 AM;"Finally, MEDs gain access to Curasa and Curaja, which heal based on the % of HP lost, giving the MED its optimal way of playing : burst healing when *necessary*";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:21 AM;But they are only important once you start getting a lot more HP;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:22 AM;"It's hard to say exactly when that happens, but you'll feel your MED having trouble healing heavily injured characters quickly";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:30 AM;what are AoE debuffs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:30 AM;Their names end with -ga;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:30 AM;Like Deprotega;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:30 AM;"They suck ass, unfortunately";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:31 AM;o right;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:31 AM;"So, as for Secondary Roles, I wouldn't ignore them all outright, @Izwar Vain#5689";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:31 AM;"There are some worthy, more-or-less adventurous investments you can do fairly early";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:32 AM;"The safest, cheapest one is getting Hope's Ruin";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:32 AM;"It costs only a total of 6000 CP and gives him COM, which can be nice when he's in the team";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:33 AM;"Getting Vanille's Ruin costs much more, and so is better grabbed later, but is also worth investing in before beating the story";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:34 AM;"Giving Fang her first two RAV spells, Fire and Thunder, makes her a serviceable RAV";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:34 AM;"Better than not being one, at least";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:34 AM;"More adventurously, you can venture down Fang's SYN and grab Bravera";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:35 AM;"Well used, the buff will help you decimate foes, but that's a pretty advanced thing to get that early";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:35 AM;"Getting everyone's SEN is fun, too, because SEN/SEN/SEN is a great paradigm to help survive immensely powerful AoE some enemies and bosses can throw";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:35 AM;If you react fast enough;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:36 AM;hmmm;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:36 AM;But it's not really necessary unless you're underleveled;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:38 AM;yeah okay;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:38 AM;Now for teams;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:38 AM;"Weaker, smaller enemies (generally come in groups)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:40 AM;Sazh/Lightning/Fang or Sazh/Lightning/Snow (if he has Blitz already);;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:40 AM;Key paradigms : SYN/COM/COM;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:40 AM;Weaker enemies in groups are best dealt with using strong AoEs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:41 AM;Staggering each of them individually to kill them alone one after another is inefficient and slow;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:41 AM;Variations on this;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:43 AM;"-Ga Spells : Once Hope and Vanille start getting -ga spells in RAV, you can put one of them instead of Light, Snow or Fang, if the enemy is weak to one of the -ga spells they have (example : if Hope has Firaga, and the enemy group is mostly weak to Fire, you can put him instead of Snow)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:43 AM;"In which case you can use SYN/COM/RAV to great effect, and to deal quickly with groups of small enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:45 AM;"- Need to survive : You can use SYN/COM/SEN and COM/COM/SEN until the fight has more manageable survivability, at which point you can go SYN/COM/COM or COM/COM/COM (if you're have all the buffs you need, you don't need SYN anymore)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:47 AM;"Strong enemies, alone";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:51 AM;"Sazh/Vanille/X for more-or-less offensive approaches, Sazh/Hope/X for more balanced approaches";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:52 AM;"Key Paradigms : RAV/RAV/RAV, RAV/RAV/SAB, RAV/RAV/SEN (sometimes), For preemptives : COM/SYN/SAB and RAV/SYN/SAB";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:53 AM;"Most strong enemies are better off staggered as fast as possible, and dealt as much damage as possible before stagger ends";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:56 AM;"Paradigms with multiple RAVs allow you to stagger quickly, and in case of preemptives, COM/SYN/SAB allows you to get the buffs and debuffs you need before staggering the enemy, while RAV/SYN/SAB allows you to stagger immediately.";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:56 AM;ugh theres SO much to think about;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:56 AM;"Yeah this game can be very, very complex";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:57 AM;"A shame you need none of it to *beat* it, most of the time";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:57 AM;i both love and hate it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:57 AM;"For now, I recommend you try using this SYN/COM/COM strategy next time you meet groups of weak enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:58 AM;They should be dispatched fairly quickly;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 06:58 AM;i think i try to go for the stronger ones as i like to get as much cp as i can in one go;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:58 AM;"Using AoE strategies well in this game is one of the hardest thing to do, and that's the basest of them";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:59 AM;"I can't help much with team building for bosses, because they're all pretty different";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:00 AM;But remember Sazh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:00 AM;"As long as he's the only one with Haste, he's vital";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:00 AM;"thats okay, youve helped heaps already";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:00 AM;Especially in longer fights;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:01 AM;I can't imagine doing Chapter 11 without Sazh constantly in the party;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:02 AM;i want the accessory that casts haste at the start of the battle;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:02 AM;but its so annoying to get;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:02 AM;"It's pretty good for small enemies, but nothing else";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:02 AM;It gives Haste for only 30 seconds;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:04 AM;oh shit really;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:04 AM;wtf rude;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:04 AM;Yeah it's a really short buff;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:04 AM;ughhh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:05 AM;The other accessories that give buffs at the start last 60 seconds;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:05 AM;"The offensive buffs ones, really good for weak enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:05 AM;"And the defensive ones are really good for strong enemies, so that you survive better right off the bat, until you get your own defensive buffs going (which will last much longer)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:06 AM;Especially enemies that like to start with a BANG;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:06 AM;And hit you like a truck;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:06 AM;yeah okay;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:06 AM;i love that i looked up how long itd take to play this game and it said like 55 hours for the main story and ive already played 57 and im no where near done;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:07 AM;"The great thing is that there is a *single* accessory that gives the 4 defensive buffs, so it's a pretty good accessory";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:07 AM;The Tetradic Crown;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:07 AM;Eh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:07 AM;We all play at our rhythm;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:08 AM;oh nice;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:08 AM;yeah but im borrowing the xbox from my dad while hes away and i was trying to finish it before he got back;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:08 AM;which is sunday;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:09 AM;"Ah, I see";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:10 AM;"yeah, thats why i was in such a rush";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:11 AM;Good luck then;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:11 AM;"If you have questions, don't hesitate to @ me";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:14 AM;thank you so much ^-^;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:14 AM;oh! one last thing;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:14 AM;completely unrelated;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:15 AM;You're welcome 👍;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:15 AM;What is it ?;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:15 AM;do most people consider bravely default to be ff? my friend rants to me all the time about the similarities;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:16 AM;Eeh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:16 AM;Well;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:16 AM;It's inspired in part by an older FF;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:16 AM;"5, to be precise";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:17 AM;"Other than the mechanics being inspired by FF5, the prominence of crystals is also very FF-like";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:17 AM;Other than that... not really;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:17 AM;It's a turn-based JRPG that's its own thing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:18 AM;It's not developed by Square either;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:18 AM;oh okay;;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:18 AM;i think another thing that my friend mentioned  is that there's a cid in it too;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:19 AM;Maybe;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:19 AM;"There might be allusions, but they're not *important* if you ask me";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 07:19 AM;"The mechanics and the presence of the crystals is what really makes the link with FF clear, but distant";;
lostxstars#0212;18-Oct-18 07:23 AM;"yeah okay, thank you";;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 10:04 AM;They're enjoyable;;
Deep#9598;18-Oct-18 10:04 AM;Some interesting jobs;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 10:41 AM;Does it matter if I lose the first blitzball game?;;
Leon#9542;18-Oct-18 10:44 AM;"Nah, they expect you to lose";;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 10:44 AM;Nope.;;
Leon#9542;18-Oct-18 10:44 AM;"you don't get much for winning, just a slightly different cutscene and a sphere";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 11:25 AM;Word. Im right about there. Just saved yuna on the ship. Couldn’t figure out how to power up that crane at first.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 11:26 AM;My sleep schedule is all screwed up because of time zone shit so I was up early this morning and decided to play for a bit.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 11:26 AM;I’m excited to get back after work and play more. I’m liking it more than I thought I would.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 11:27 AM;"Also, I almost deleted my 6 hour save file by mistake when I was trying to figure out the cross save thing.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 11:27 AM;That would have been a nightmare because I’m not sure if I would have restarted right away. I would have been so pissed.;;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 03:21 PM;The satisfaction of winning :tabata:;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 03:44 PM;Nice.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 05:43 PM;Yeah. Thanks. I felt pretty fucking good about it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:21 PM;I can also see why X is often at the top of the list of “which FF is best for a newcomer?”;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Oct-18 06:24 PM;"I honestly don't. I mean, sure, it's one of the easier ones, if not the easiest (of the main line)";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Oct-18 06:24 PM;"Personally, I'd say 4, 6, 7, or 9";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:27 PM;"I don’t disagree. I’m no FF vet but if anyone asks me, I say 6.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:27 PM;"It was my first and it really sucked me in. As you know, I’m a filthy casual. I barely play video games. But FF is fucking phenomenal.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:28 PM;Except 15. That isn’t real FF.;;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 06:28 PM;"`One of the easier ones, if not the easiest` Good joke :tabata:";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:28 PM;I’ve heard the main story of X is really easy.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:28 PM;Or at least relatively easy.;;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 06:28 PM;"Also Sazh said it the best. From what I remember, it was something along the lines of it familiarizes you with the various systems and isn't overbearing while being fun and a solid game";;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 06:29 PM;X houses two of the most difficult story bosses in the franchise;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:29 PM;Really? Shit.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:29 PM;Don’t tell me anything.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:29 PM;But have I beaten one yet?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:30 PM;And fucking final boss of FFI was the toughest one yet for me.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:30 PM;Dude was a cunt.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:30 PM;"As much as you can break FFX open with little effort, it's definitely not the easiest game in the series";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:30 PM;Which game is in your opinion?;;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 06:30 PM;"No, the two difficult ones are late in the story";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:31 PM;The easiest.;;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 06:31 PM;I'd probably say either IV or VII;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:32 PM;I'd say 4 too;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:32 PM;Interesting. I found both to be more difficult than X;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:32 PM;At least to where I am in X;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:32 PM;But honestly it differs according to the type of players;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:32 PM;Fair.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:33 PM;And depending on what one means by easy and hard;;
Rasea#1840;18-Oct-18 06:33 PM;"Yeah, X has a really nice difficulty curve which also helps it be a great introductory title";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:33 PM;I broke 6 but haven’t broken any of the others.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:33 PM;So I won’t even comment on difficulty of 6. It was my first so I was worried about difficulty. Ended up grinding hard and trivialized the last third of the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:34 PM;Every other one I’ve played has been more “organic”;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:34 PM;I personally find grinding abhorrent outside of extreme circumstances (such as challenge runs) and even then I try to avoid it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:34 PM;Which is why games that put so much emphasis on grinding absolutely disgust me;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:35 PM;Agreed. 6 was my first jrpg. People said grind so I did. Baaaaaa;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:35 PM;"Whether they *require* you to grind, or whether you *will need* to grind if you don't have prescience";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:35 PM;The latter is particularly present in hard games that are very character-building oriented;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:35 PM;"Oh woops, don't have the right build ? Gotta have to grind bud";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:35 PM;Yeah pretty much.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:36 PM;Flexibility coming only at the cost of grinding is horrid;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:36 PM;Yeah. I don’t think I could ever grind like I did in 6 again and still love the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:37 PM;6 is my favorite despite all that.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:37 PM;It's all right.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:37 PM;I think X might end up second. The music is my favorite so far.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:37 PM;10 has a good OST.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;It's among my favorites too.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;For sure.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;It used to be;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;"Now outside of a few select tracks, I find it very boring";;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;I'm biased as shit though so I still put 6's at the top.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;And the battle theme annoys me;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:38 PM;Yeah. I like 6’s OST best still.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:39 PM;I dunno. I really like 10's battle theme though.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:39 PM;Haha me too evil. Me too.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:39 PM;I don't really like 8's battle theme that much.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:39 PM;I like 8’s victory theme;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:39 PM;It's alright.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:39 PM;Like I just won a beach volley ball game in the Caribbean.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:40 PM;My favorite victory fanfare is probably 7's.;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 06:41 PM;Followed by maybe 6's or 9's.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Oct-18 06:44 PM;8’s victory fanfare sounds like sunscreen and mai Tai;;

Perrydice#9311;18-Oct-18 09:00 PM;Most likely. I hate my current one.;;

Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 08:25 AM;Yeah for sure.  It will be a change because I have never worked for a non-profit organization and I am making way more than majority of my for-profit jobs.;;

Deep#9598;21-Oct-18 03:16 PM;"Auto life with Quina. Twister works wonders, too. It's considered an insect and flying enemy, so either bug killer or bird killer will increase damage output. The issue with Quina and Steiner for this, though, is that their abilities and equipment is the same as before you entered this entire sequence, so you can't change it. Thievery should deal good damage if you've been stealing consecutively.";;

Nobuo#3856;21-Oct-18 03:35 PM;"It is recommended to bring plenty of Vaccines to counter Virus Fly., , Equipping Bug Killer along with Wind-elemental weapons makes dealing with this enemy easy. It can be defeated even faster if Quina has access to the Twister spell.";;
Nobuo#3856;21-Oct-18 03:35 PM;(off of the wiki btw);;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Oct-18 03:37 PM;The thing with that gauntlet is theres a set timer when it actually can be killed. Same goes for the other two fights. Technically each have infinite HP till then;;
Deep#9598;21-Oct-18 03:37 PM;"I would say bird killer is the better option for the sequence, because you fight that aerial thing in the room before";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;22-Oct-18 04:10 PM;i think it's just a gimmick fight this time around... teaching boost and shield;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;22-Oct-18 04:11 PM;"i didnt pick that up for a turn or two because, again, i wasnt really paying attention. So, it barely out-DPS'd me before the overdrive gauge filled.";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Oct-18 04:27 PM;"Basically attack, shield, repeat";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;22-Oct-18 04:27 PM;it wants you to just use boost and shield until the gauge is filled;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Oct-18 04:27 PM;Not quite;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;22-Oct-18 04:27 PM;"but yeah, shield for the meteor attach, boost for the physical attack";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;22-Oct-18 04:27 PM;no?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;22-Oct-18 04:28 PM;"so instead of boost, I just attack instead?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Oct-18 04:30 PM;I play it safe and alternate between attacking and shielding;;
Rasea#1840;22-Oct-18 04:30 PM;"If it wants you to use overdrive, or you want to, then use Boost on a normal attack. Using it when Belgy's aeon does their special command is a bad idea since, iirc, it deals 1.5x damage";;
Rasea#1840;22-Oct-18 04:30 PM;"I know there's a fight (before you encounter her way later on) where you have to actually overdrive to win. Also, as a note about that in general";;
Rasea#1840;22-Oct-18 04:31 PM;"Since FFX uses CRT (I think that's the acronym?) to determine turn order, different actions have different amounts of wait time attached to them. Above all, overdrives have high CRT. Especially for aeons. So if you're going to overdrive in a Belgy fight, wait until your aeon would die on the next turn";;
Rasea#1840;22-Oct-18 04:31 PM;Otherwise using overdrive means Belgy's aeon gets 3-4 turns before you get another one;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:02 PM;Although I will say the iOS version of FFI was really fast.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Oct-18 04:03 PM;"My suggestion is buy a 3DS, get CT, and Radiant Historia";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Oct-18 04:05 PM;^;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:18 PM;That's in the plan. I am buying a 2DS XL for my step-daughter and fully intend on using it more than she will.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:18 PM;"But for the time being, I have already purchased CT";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:18 PM;on Vita;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:18 PM;But I am excited to play some of the older Zelda games on he 2DS;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:18 PM;Never played Ocarina of Time so that's definitely top of list.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:19 PM;"... err I mean, I'm sure she'll enjoy that Zelda game so I'll buy it for her";;
Rasea#1840;23-Oct-18 04:19 PM;👀;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:19 PM;It's a mutually beneficial purchase. Whatever.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Oct-18 04:20 PM;Whatever works :P;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Oct-18 04:25 PM;"My dad, and his brothers did the same thing";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Oct-18 04:25 PM;Like my dad would get one of his brothers a gift he (my dad) would enjoy and vice versa;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Oct-18 04:49 PM;"Ha, yup.";;
Nobuo#3856;23-Oct-18 11:12 PM;is it possible to complete a lot of ff9 through a blind playthrough;;
Nobuo#3856;23-Oct-18 11:12 PM;like secret bosses and etc;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Oct-18 11:12 PM;define complete a lot of;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Oct-18 11:13 PM;It's possible to blind playthrough all of them.;;
Nobuo#3856;23-Oct-18 11:13 PM;"what I mean by complete a lot, I mean find most of the hidden items or enemies";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Oct-18 11:16 PM;I liked to think so;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Oct-18 11:16 PM;Yeah I say so.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;24-Oct-18 12:36 AM;Just read the missable lists;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Oct-18 12:37 AM;But that defeats the purpose of doing a blind playthrough;;
Izwar Vain#5689;24-Oct-18 12:37 AM;Ohhhh;;
Deep#9598;24-Oct-18 03:05 AM;I think you'll miss a few things;;
Deep#9598;24-Oct-18 03:06 AM;There are some things the game never tells you about;;
Deep#9598;24-Oct-18 03:08 AM;Some items you might miss the chance of getting. But most of them can be bought or made later;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Oct-18 09:11 AM;You'll definitely miss key items that serve no purpose and a secret boss but aside from that not much;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Oct-18 09:24 AM;Hopefully you have fun.  IX is one of my favorites of the series.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Oct-18 10:35 AM;"If one does the Chocobo Hot & Cold in full, they won't miss the optional boss";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Oct-18 05:10 PM;@Nobuo#3856 No. Unless you are a JRPG vet.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Oct-18 05:11 PM;I've been playing FF games for the last nine months. I'd like to think I'm pretty smart and all that... but there are just some parts of these games that you wouldn't pick up without a lot of experience.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Oct-18 05:12 PM;"Regarding JRPGs, the logic meter reads about a 7/10 for me.";;
Nobuo#3856;24-Oct-18 06:05 PM;Yeah I can see how cause in the ruined world of ff6 it's tricky to find some places without a guide;;
Izwar Vain#5689;24-Oct-18 09:44 PM;"The main characters are pretty easy to spot, the extra (extra as in you didn't have them before the world of ruin) characters yes you would probably need a guide";;
Izwar Vain#5689;24-Oct-18 09:44 PM;But still not impossible to figure out on your own if you take time to explore;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Oct-18 09:45 PM;It's much more rewarding when you do it yourself.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Oct-18 09:45 PM;"But I'll be honest, I could never figure out the superbosses in VII on my own.";;
Deep#9598;25-Oct-18 03:13 AM;"For a bunch of the world of ruin, the game pushes you into finding several characters if you follow that path. Once you get the airship back, Celes will say follow that bird, and that leads you to Zozo, then you get the idea about the Veldt Cave, etc. There are a few of them that have no indication at all and require exploration and experimentation";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 06:45 AM;"Sometimes, I like the aspect of exploration similar to how FF1 worked.";;
darresh#9170;25-Oct-18 02:04 PM;I am about to jump into ffx2 remaster.... don't want to use a guide .  any general off the top of your head tips?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 02:05 PM;push past the story;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 02:06 PM;Focus on the gameplay.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 02:07 PM;And expect the dialogue to be bad. It is pretty funny.;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:08 PM;"You'll miss plenty of things because FFX-2 is stupid about everything that's not its combat system. Other than that..., , You gain AP for your dresspheres by killing an enemy (1 AP normally, 2 for an Oversouled one) or by taking actions that are not Attack. Such as magic, unique commands, Steal/Mug, etc., , Don't neglect Garment Grids. They're quite powerful on stat bonuses alone, to say nothing of abilities they may offer. Play around with them.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:08 PM;Anything else would pretty much be missables and whatnot so I won't point those out;;
darresh#9170;25-Oct-18 02:10 PM;"Got it,  thank you all.  Will post a trip report";;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Oct-18 02:17 PM;"Remember to always visit all places first before moving on with the main story, well that is if you are even interested";;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Oct-18 02:18 PM;"There will come a point where you have to choose a side, now that is a crucial moment IF you want to 100% the game which you probably won't because you're not using a guide anyways";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:19 PM;In which case both sides suck so pick whatever :tabata:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Oct-18 02:20 PM;"Yeah, and both give the story a quite different pathway but it doesn't affect the actual endings";;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Oct-18 02:21 PM;With also different items attained;;
Deep#9598;25-Oct-18 02:41 PM;Doesn't siding with one side specifically lock out one of the areas?;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:42 PM;Yep;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Oct-18 02:50 PM;"Yups, hence the different story pathways";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 03:19 PM;"`siding with one side` , I like this wording";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 03:20 PM;👌;;
Deep#9598;25-Oct-18 03:22 PM;😗;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 03:23 PM;Is good;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 03:23 PM;Almost my level of wording;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 03:24 PM;"Soon, you'll be the Master, and the circle will be complete";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 09:33 AM;Gonna continue the FFX journey on my flight in a bit. Should make some good progress. Questions to follow;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 09:43 AM;answers will follow back;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:43 PM;Was that boss on the beach supposed to take so long?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:43 PM;With the protective arms? Did I just not figure out what would have taken him down faster?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:47 PM;How long did it take you?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:47 PM;"Also: Take down the head first, then the arms, then the body";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:47 PM;Yeah that’s what I did.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:49 PM;I think it took like 4-5 rounds of arm regeneration;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:51 PM;**tries to think back how long it usually takes him**;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:51 PM;That sounds about right;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:51 PM;"I usually have Tidus, Yuna, and Auron, and substitute Yuna for Wakka, to take down the head when it gets restless.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:57 PM;I used yuna auron and the kangaroo dude;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:57 PM;He was doing more damage than tidus on the arms.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 01:57 PM;Oh and I used wakka to take the head out before I subbed him out for kangaroo;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:58 PM;"` kangaroo dude`, , :wakka:";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 01:59 PM;kimahri is not a kangaroo;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:02 PM;I know. Whatever.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:02 PM;Anyway. That boss took fucking forever.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:15 PM;This game is still really linear.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:15 PM;Does it open up at all?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:15 PM;Not that I have a problem with the linear part. I actually like it.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:24 PM;Depends on your definition of open up;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:24 PM;Hmm.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:25 PM;I’m not sure what my definition is;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:27 PM;I'd say it's somewhere inbetween 13's linearity and umm... I actually don't have a good comparison;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:29 PM;"like, it's not as open as the other titles, but it's not as linear as 13";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:32 PM;I haven’t played that one.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:36 PM;"Just I, IV, VI, VII, VIII.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:37 PM;And now up until the part in X where the boss takes forever.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:37 PM;It was a war of attrition.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:39 PM;"Once I figured out he couldn’t outright kill me, I just kept chipping away. Played it safe, kept heals up... I just didn’t know if there was a spell or some status effect or whatever that I could have used.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:44 PM;"If there is, I don't know about it";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:44 PM;"But yeah, it's kinda of a slow boss fight";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:44 PM;So I just checked out the strategy. I should have  been using Lulu;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:44 PM;She can bypass the arms and damage the body directly.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:45 PM;I don’t think I have second tier spells with her yet either. I definitely forgot to put her in the battle so she missed out on a ton of ap;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:45 PM;I never use Lulu;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:46 PM;I *hate* having to constantly switch characters in/out and use an action (usually defend) just so they can get experience;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:46 PM;Really? Ok then I don’t feel so bad.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:46 PM;Yeah.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:46 PM;"Which is why I have a mod that bypasses that, and just gives everyone the EXP";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:47 PM;"Right now, I feel like the Hp nodes are the most important in the sphere grid";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:47 PM;I’m making kangaroo my thief.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:48 PM;.slap @Santa Filthy Casual#9506 He's not a kangaroo;;
Nadeko#6685;27-Oct-18 02:48 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 He's not a kangaroo;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:48 PM;It’s fine.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:48 PM;Is it ok to make Roo my thief?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:50 PM;I wish I could rename him to kangaroo in the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:50 PM;Kangaroo + Ferrari = Kimarhi;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:51 PM;* Kimahri;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:51 PM;(Kangaroo);;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:51 PM;Thief is a good path;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:52 PM;Black Mage is another great path;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 02:52 PM;"Set him up as a Black Mage, and he becomes as powerful, if not more powerful than Lulu";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:55 PM;Hmm.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 02:56 PM;I was going back and forth between the two. I think I may have sent him to the thief circle;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 03:01 PM;There's no real wrong path for Kimahri;;
Deep#9598;27-Oct-18 03:01 PM;Something I found useful nearer the end was to use spheres to activate the -aga spells for Yuna;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:05 PM;Does that work like that?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:05 PM;Are you talking about mp spheres and that shit?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 03:09 PM;"Later on/end/post game you'll get/can get rare(ish) spheres like Black Mage spheres, Friend Spheres, Teleport Spheres, etc. with which you can teach someone, like Yuna, things like the -aga spells";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:12 PM;Black or white magic?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:12 PM;Or either?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 03:13 PM;Both;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 03:13 PM;There's a fair amount of other spheres;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 03:14 PM;"In short, by the time you're doing post game content, you'll have your best three will have gone down everyone's paths";;
Deep#9598;27-Oct-18 03:16 PM;"I was a pretty OCD player my first time, so I was always doing that switch thing every battle to keep everyone balanced";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:17 PM;Wow. Really?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:17 PM;Everyone else’s path? Damn.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 03:17 PM;I don’t think I’ll really do much post game stuff but we’ll see. I really like it so far. Still need to finish IV at some point too.;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 03:46 PM;FFX questions 👀;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 03:49 PM;"Anyways, Kimahri functions best going down Rikku's path";;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 03:49 PM;*looks up my guide to remember my own advice*;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 03:59 PM;"Ah, there we go. You'll get to an area called Macalania at some point. There's a boss there. The third one, specifically, to avoid spoilers. His rare item drop (rare drops from all enemies are a 12.5% chance) is 1-2 Special Spheres. It's worth resetting for it if you can be bothered, as you can use them to give Kimahri a special node. Most notably, Steal (and Use if you get 2 of them)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:01 PM;I already took him to the sphere grid area that has steal and use.;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:02 PM;Ah you took him down Rikku's path initially? Most don't do that;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:02 PM;Nevermind then;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:02 PM;Can give those to Tidus then;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:02 PM;Not sure.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:02 PM;I haven’t seen her in a while;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:03 PM;o.o What's that mean?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:04 PM;I saw her on the ship.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:04 PM;But I haven’t gotten her back in my party yet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:04 PM;So I don’t know what path she’s on;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Oct-18 04:06 PM;Spoilers sweetie;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:08 PM;"Oh right. You mentioned Auron, just assumed you had Rikku. Beach boss... trying to remember which boss that is";;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:08 PM;"Oh, wait. Operation Mi'ihen?";;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:09 PM;The only one I can think of with regenerating arms while you have Auron;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:13 PM;Yeah. Operation mi...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;27-Oct-18 04:14 PM;So basically I’m hearing that Rikku. = Yuffie;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:15 PM;Uhhh... sort of;;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:15 PM;"Like, character wise, definitely. Hyperactive, energetic, funny";;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:16 PM;"Rikku is very squishy when you get her, and won't deal any real damage with her attacks for a long time. The former is easily fixable because she has several HP nodes early on in her grid";;
Rasea#1840;27-Oct-18 04:16 PM;The latter is fixed by abusing Steal & Use. There's a ton of powerful ass items that she can take advantage of and use those to deal damage;;

Deep#9598;28-Oct-18 02:38 AM;"Rikku is the quirky character of X. Like Yuffie in VII, Selphie in VIII and Quina in IX";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:07 AM;So can I focus on like 3-4 characters or will all of them need to be leveled in some way?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:08 AM;where exactly are you in the game?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:39 AM;Um..;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:40 AM;Not any further than I was yesterday. So pretty much a little past the boss we discussed yesterday;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:40 AM;I fell asleep for the second flight like a good little traveler.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Oct-18 07:41 AM;"AFAIK, you can pretty much beat the game with just 3 characters";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:42 AM;Just keep Kimahri levelled up aswell;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:43 AM;"Don't ask me why, just do";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:49 AM;Hmm. Ok. I took him over to Rikku’s sphere by mistake.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:49 AM;"Nah, that's actually perfect";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:49 AM;Or not by mistake I guess. I just did it.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:50 AM;steal on kimahri is good;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:50 AM;Because I like the whole steal mechanic in FF games;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:51 AM;Ok cool;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:52 AM;It was the only direction that didn’t need a higher level key thing.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:52 AM;So I’ve been taking all characters down the path of least resistance as it were;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:52 AM;"Ah, I see";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:54 AM;I’ll be happier when you and spoopy change your names to something less confusing;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:55 AM;Can’t tell you two apart half the time.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:55 AM;"ah, that'll most possibly be on or after the 1st";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 07:55 AM;:GWqlabsKek:;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 07:57 AM;I figured;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 08:01 AM;So the airship will let me travel around. But there doesn’t appear to be to much in the way of large open areas to explore;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Oct-18 08:01 AM;"Yeah, not much really";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 08:01 AM;Or does that come later too?;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Oct-18 08:02 AM;Theres some secrets for the airship you'll discover if you look hard enough.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 08:05 AM;Secrets for the airship? Like hidden places I can take it for loot?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Oct-18 11:05 AM;"Actually, you don't *need* to level Kimarhi. You'll be fine either way";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 11:07 AM;"he has steal though, so that should be handy";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;28-Oct-18 11:07 AM;"Oops, talking to myself again";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Oct-18 11:16 AM;"Yes, yes you are";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 12:30 PM;"Okay, so that character thing is a bit complicated because of how FFX works";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 12:38 PM;"They set up the use everyone a little bit to get them sphere levels and swap in/out constantly because of the design direction of the enemy types., , -Fliers (Wakka has high accuracy, they have high evasion, he's the only one that can consistently hit them), -Agiles (Tidus is the only character that can get a turn before them and kill them, excluding Rikku but she has to use Use), -Magicals (Lulu, stuff like the flans and mushrooms, the former has stupidly high defense and the latter often counters with a nasty attack when hit with a melee attack), -Armoreds (Auron deals with these, armored units are pretty obvious), -Giants (this is a mixture of Wakka/Auron/Lulu as they have a lot of health and deal a lot of damage, so you want to blind them and kill them ASAP), , Kimahri, being the blue mage, can fit in anywhere. I personally take him down Wakka's line because Wakka takes absolutely forever to get any decent amount of MP and Kimahri doesn't so he can use Blind Attack often enough., , Rikku fits into her little niche of super fast, uses items, can use powerful mixes";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 12:42 PM;"You can choose to not use Kimahri at all (though that's obviously not what's happening in your case). Rikku can also not be used. Yuna serves as a healer. Another powerful niche is that she can render her party immune to elemental attacks with NulElement. Very useful because magical attacks tend to be the most painful. It also stops elementally imbued physical attacks, such as against Bombs";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 12:43 PM;You can eventually give Yuna some Black Magic spheres to teach her -ga spells so she can do something other than heal;;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Oct-18 02:08 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 its supposed to be a secret for a reason. :cactuar:;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 02:09 PM;The only *real* worthwhile secret is the one where you pick up Rikku's Victorious shield;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 02:09 PM;"But yeah, there are a few codes you can punch into the airship once you get it and it puts you in otherwise unreachable places to get special equipment";;
pokemongenius#1474;28-Oct-18 02:25 PM;Your not supposed to say that here #spoilers;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 08:41 PM;Hmm. Ok. And I guess I pick these codes up as I play?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 08:41 PM;I’m at the Djose Cloister of Trials right now;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Oct-18 08:42 PM;How do you answer a question about how to complete a part of a game without spoiling parts of it?;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Oct-18 08:42 PM;🤔;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 08:49 PM;Very carefully;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Oct-18 08:52 PM;"I honestly didn't care about the secrets, I just looked up a guide 😂";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Oct-18 08:55 PM;It's kinda hard not to.;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 09:18 PM;"Sorry, been working today. Anyways";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 09:19 PM;There are three codes you can find throughout the game. It takes a bit of imagination and a lot of running around looking for clues and thinking about what the clues mean;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 09:19 PM;"So, yes, you technically can find them organically. One of them requires most of the Al Bhed primers though";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 09:20 PM;Most people just opt to look them up though because fuck that noise;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Oct-18 10:25 PM;Noise?;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:27 PM;A phrase meaning screw bothering with that;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Oct-18 10:28 PM;Ahhhhh;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Oct-18 10:28 PM;*writes down in notebook*;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:28 PM;👍;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 10:41 PM;Word. I’ve seen some signs in al bhed while I’ve been going along.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 10:42 PM;And other things that were “curious”;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:42 PM;"Yeah, there's a select few that gives you hints and clues about the passwords";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 10:44 PM;"Once I finish the main quest line, can I do end game stuff after or do I need to make a save before the final dungeon?";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:45 PM;"It reverts back. There's a save sphere just before the area of the final boss area. You can't keep anything from the final boss area, so it's purely for storytelling/cinematic purposes";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:45 PM;"So just save there, beat the boss, reload that save and do whatever stuff afterwards";;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:45 PM;A la FF12;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 10:46 PM;Got it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 10:46 PM;Thanks;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:47 PM;Welcome ^^;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;28-Oct-18 10:49 PM;I’ll probably play some more tomorrow. Was having a little trouble figuring out the djose temple;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:50 PM;Yeah that one is always the one that gets me;;
Rasea#1840;28-Oct-18 10:51 PM;Until the Macalania Temple -_-;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 08:51 AM;Is that the hardest one?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 10:16 AM;So I can travel to all these places again once I get the airship? What about all these “trails” and roadways I’ve been walking along that act as pseudo-dungeons? Will I ever want or need to go down them again?;;
Brion#4623;29-Oct-18 10:30 AM;Some of them have side quests later. Like the Thunder Plains and the forest with the butterflies;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 10:36 AM;You'll be able to revisit all locations save for one;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 11:30 AM;Yeah I missed the first two destruction spheres and I don’t think I can go back and complete those cloisters;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 11:32 AM;Or rather besaid has some post game boss guarding it so I’m fucked there. And I think I saw that bevelle (or something like that) is a one-off.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 11:33 AM;you can't miss the destruction sphere there;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 11:33 AM;"But since I’ve missed besaid and Kilimanjaro destruction spheres, I guess it doesn’t matter.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 11:33 AM;Oh right. I mistakenly read that it’s part of the story progression.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 11:33 AM;The Djose cloister was a bit of a bitch to figure out.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 11:34 AM;I wasn’t leaving without doing the destruction sphere part. Got a stupid magic sphere for my troubles. Gee thanks.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Oct-18 12:48 PM;Those make a bigger difference than you think;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:03 PM;Uh...Are you playing the HD version?;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:03 PM;Cause um...;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:03 PM;"Yeah, it makes a difference .";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:06 PM;"Yes, yes he is";;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 04:07 PM;...yeah he's boned for pretty much a lot of side content.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 08:10 PM;Why?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Oct-18 08:12 PM;It’s my first playthrough and I’m going blind. I’m absolutely going to miss shit. Boned sounds like a strong word.;;
Rasea#1840;29-Oct-18 08:14 PM;"He just meant side content, afaik. Which is... pretty inaccurate, honestly. A lot of the side content for FFX is really straightforward";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 08:54 PM;"A lot of the side content, if not all of it,  is preparation for Penance/Monster Arena";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 08:55 PM;"Specifically the final one you face (forget his name, but is a reskin of Omega)";;
pokemongenius#1474;29-Oct-18 09:21 PM;Nemesis;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 09:47 PM;Thanks;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 09:47 PM;"But yeah, 10's sidequests are preparations for Nemesis and Penance";;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Oct-18 10:54 PM;"Yeah, I was confused on how leaving out some destruction spheres greatly affects the side content";;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Oct-18 10:55 PM;Or even if it has any effect at all;;
Rasea#1840;29-Oct-18 11:37 PM;"Not particularly, really. On the side content";;
Rasea#1840;29-Oct-18 11:38 PM;Omega Ruins isn't preparation so much as hey you can get actual levels now. Remiem Temple has nothing to do with preparation and instead offers some neat rewards;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 12:45 AM;Like I said earlier *most* of them are.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 12:46 AM;"And plus, you kinda need to do Remiem Temple to get the Cloudy Mirror, which has connections to the Celestial Weapons";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 12:46 AM;"Ah right, forgot Cloudy Mirror comes from that";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 12:46 AM;I only ever remember it for the aeons and chocobo race;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Oct-18 01:27 AM;Ahhhh yeah that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Oct-18 07:54 AM;I don’t know about any of that shit. I just wanna complete the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Oct-18 09:43 AM;Whatever I find along the way is gravy;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Oct-18 09:45 AM;So is it fair to say that I don't really need to pay attention to any side quests/stuff until I get the airship? The game is exceptionally linear right now and Im not sure exactly how'd I'd go about doing side stuff right now (except blitzball at the save points);;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 10:33 AM;I would save the sidequests for another playthrough;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Oct-18 11:17 AM;"ok, so now just concentrate on playing the game organically... if i stumble upon something I want to do, so be it?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 11:40 AM;Sure;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 11:42 AM;"Also, it's best to use a guide, or two, for the sidequests";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Oct-18 12:21 PM;"word, im not doing any guide stuff this time around";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Oct-18 12:22 PM;(except for maybe when I couldnt figure out I needed to push the pedastal into the well in the Djose cloister);;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 02:36 PM;"Yeah, you can entirely ignore sidequest stuff";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 02:42 PM;"Which, despite people's issues with the design of FFX's sidequests, is actually pretty nice. Most other FF games tend to have rather important things locked behind sidequests";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 02:59 PM;"Let's see, counting them, we have..., , -Celestial weapons, involving a various amount of ~~sadistic, painful~~ activities, used only for the Monster Arena, -Lightning Dodging activity, done for some great items, but the best prize being Lulu's sigil, -Cactuar Village, lackluster items + another sigil, -Revisiting the temples to do destruction sphere stuff if you didn't the first time, -Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, housing an aeon, some enemies with nice Steals and a powerful weapon for Rikku, -Auron's spheres, this one is probably the only major one that impacts story gameplay since Auron's overdrives are locked behind it, -Hidden airship areas. Three password related ones, three hidden ones that also gives awesome equipment. Also access to Omega Ruins (postgame dungeon) and Baaj Temple, housing the strongest aeon in the game (second strongest if you don't mind RNG), -Remiem Temple, which offers some great rewards. Usually just done postgame as part of the Celestial weapon sidequest, but it has **amazing** mix/equipment ability items up for grabs if you do a few of the fights there and spend time on the chocobo challenge";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:11 PM;In short: most are in preparation for Monster Arena/Nemesis and Penance;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:14 PM;"Personally I count Omega Ruins, cause I prefer grinding there over Don Tonberry,  and for capturing enemies";;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:15 PM;Ambushed!;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:15 PM;Game Over;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:20 PM;"Have Auron in your party, with his Celestial Weapon";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:25 PM;You'd spend *a lot* of time grinding there in order to fully beat Monster Arena & the super bosses;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:32 PM;You can also just set First Strike onto a weapon of Tidus (and/or Rikku if she has Flee). Or just buy a Sonic Steel in Macalania;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:35 PM;I also have reservations about worrying about Auron's celestial weapon because his is the... 4th hardest one to do;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:36 PM;I forgot how to get it;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:37 PM;"His Crest is from the gorge after doing Chocobo Eater. His Weapon is getting the Rusty Sword near Cavern of Stolen Fayth then putting it in the hidden statue on Mushroom Rock Road. His Sigil involves unlocking 10 area or species creations, which means a few hours of capturing";;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:39 PM;Ooooh right;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:41 PM;Though you could probably do it in about 1.5 hours if you got lucky. Since there are 13 areas that are eligible for monster capturing. Omega Ruins is excluded because you would need First Strike before going in there. Which means you have to capture one of each monster from 10 of the 12 areas to get his Celestial Weapon;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:41 PM;I would have to say his is the 2nd easiest to get;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:41 PM;Rikku's being the easiest;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:42 PM;time consuming isn't hard;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:44 PM;"Rikku > Yuna > Kimahri > Auron > Lulu > Wakka > Tidus. From easiest to hardest. And by difficulty, I mean a combination of tedium and time consumption";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:44 PM;You can switch Kimahri & Auron in the standing (3 and 4 respectively to 4 and 3) depending on how hard you find the butterfly minigame;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:45 PM;"I would swap Wakka with Tidus, Wakka's takes *far longer* than Tidus's";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:45 PM;"I find Tidus's to be short, but difficult because the chocobo race minigame is hard af for me";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:45 PM;As do most people;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:46 PM;"I, however, immediately admit that Wakka's is the most time consuming one and probably the biggest reason you could have to dissuade players from postgame";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 03:47 PM;"As for Auron's, just head back to Besaid, and take the journey back to the end, in order, and you're mostly there";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:47 PM;"Yeah, that's still 90m-120m to prep for Omega Ruins. The much easier alternative is just using Tidus or Rikku for First Strike";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:48 PM;Though you could argue that you kill two birds with one stone if you're inevitably doing the celestial weapons/monster arena anyways;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:48 PM;They're all tedious tbh;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:48 PM;Rikku and Yuna is just picking up stuff though;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:49 PM;Mostly anyways;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:49 PM;The most tedium for Yuna is capturing one of every fiend in the Calm Lands. Something that's easy to do and actually *really* rewarding if you do it as soon as you get to the Calm Lands because of the reward for doing so;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:50 PM;"Likewise, for Rikku, the worst of her's is the Cactuar Village which is relatively short comparitively";;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:51 PM;It's short if you know where the cactuars are;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:51 PM;I pity anyone that doesn't use guides for the sidequests in FFX honestly;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 03:52 PM;Exactly;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:52 PM;"Well, some of them, that is";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 03:55 PM;Though the cactuar one is really easy even without knowing where they are. No Encounters on an armor and it should only take you about... 20ish minutes to find them? Faster if you use a guide;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;30-Oct-18 05:43 PM;Visit mushroom rock during post game;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:15 AM;These ochu things are fucking annoying;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Oct-18 10:17 AM;Which ones were those again;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;31-Oct-18 10:17 AM;the giant plant things;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:25 AM;Yeah. That dole out darkness and poison like nobody’s business;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:26 AM;I’m about to get lvl 2 spells for yuna and lulu shortly once I get some more sphere levels.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;31-Oct-18 10:27 AM;noice;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:28 AM;Not sure if I’m behind. I really haven’t run from any fights. Less than 5 total.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:28 AM;I’m not great about switching in party members all the time.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:29 AM;Yeah I haven’t found anything too difficult;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:29 AM;Just some long fights;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:30 AM;Ochus take forever because they have 6k HP.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:30 AM;Fire spells do a lot of damage to them but still takes forever. Especially when you have to spend turns on curing status ailments.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;31-Oct-18 10:31 AM;where are you in the game ?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:31 AM;About to hop on the Shoopuf;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;31-Oct-18 10:31 AM;ride ze shoopuf?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:31 AM;So just got to the Moonflow;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;31-Oct-18 10:32 AM;You seem to be on the right track then;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;31-Oct-18 10:32 AM;so carry on my wayward son;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:32 AM;Ha. Good song.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 10:38 AM;"As soon as you mentioned Ochu's, I knew you were on your way to the moonflow";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:42 AM;Yeah...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:43 AM;And poison status takes a ton of Hp off my characters.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 10:45 AM;You can put those fuckers to sleep though so I can cast three fires in a row.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:01 AM;I think I’m probably about halfway through the game I like it more the more I play.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:02 AM;I used an HP sphere for Tidus as his Hp seemed to be lagging everyone else’s;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:02 AM;It gave me another 300 and then I activated a normal +200 Hp sphere for a quick +500 hp upgrade. That almost doubled his HP. Haha.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 11:09 AM;"Pro tip: You can stack Cheer, 5 times max, for an insane(ish) attack/defense boost";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:45 AM;Oh it stacks? I had wondered.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:45 AM;I honestly haven't used that nor haste as much as I probably should.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-Oct-18 11:51 AM;Haste + Slow is one hell of a combo;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-Oct-18 11:51 AM;Most bosses aren't immune to Slow IIRC;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:51 AM;I think Tidus is about to learn that IIRC;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:52 AM;I'm pretty sure he's in the area for it now.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 11:52 AM;What do I call the big circles that they path down in the sphere grid?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-Oct-18 11:56 AM;Clusters ?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 12:05 PM;maybe?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 12:05 PM;I dunno;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 12:05 PM;but if you say so;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-Oct-18 12:15 PM;I don't think there's an official term for it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-Oct-18 12:15 PM;"But since they're nodes, I thought cluster might fit";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:07 PM;Clusterfuck;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:07 PM;:tabata:;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:07 PM;Also those Ochu things are really annoying if you miss the shop at Operation Mi'ihen. Which you evidently did;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:41 PM;"Being that there's a shop in the area where you talk to the dude to start Operation Mi'ihen. He sells some strong equipment, one of which is a Stonetouch weapon for Wakka, allowing Wakka to not only remain relevant, but deal with high health enemies which you have no other way of dealing with";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:41 PM;"Until you get Rikku, anyways";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:44 PM;"Speaking of which, I highly recommend backtracking after you get Rikku. I won't go into detail (unless you wanna use my item guide, then there you go), but basically after the events at the place after Rikku (before Thunder Plains, you'll know it). You should immediately backtrack to Djose Highroad and steal Petrify Grenades with Rikku";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 01:44 PM;"Or Kimahri, since you put him on the thief path";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:03 PM;Kim has steal and use now;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:04 PM;I did see the shop before Mihen. I just didn’t buy much;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:05 PM;Neat;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:05 PM;I’m hoarding money;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:05 PM;"Yeah, Stonetouch has a ~50% chance of petrifying enemies you hit, and most enemies are susceptible to the status, even the big ass health ones so it's worth investing in it if you want to ease some frustration";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:06 PM;But I’m seeing a lot of lightning ward armor stuff so I’m assuming next area is heavy on lightning attacks;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:06 PM;"Thunder Plains is definitely that, yeah";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:06 PM;Is there somewhere I can get it without going all the way back (because I’m not doing that)?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:07 PM;"Haha. Thunder plains... yeah, that sounds about right.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:09 PM;I’ll see if I can find time to play tonight. Gotta take the daughter trick or treating first.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:10 PM;I haven’t dressed up for Halloween in about 8 years. And that was for a Halloween party in NYC;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:15 PM;"That doesn't take long o.o After you get Rikku, you go and see the events at the little place. Then you run back to the Shoopuff and cross the river. Then run back to Djose Highroad since it's immediately before the first part of the Moonflow";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:16 PM;"I highly recommend making the trip, it won't take long. Not that it's needed, it just really helps to deal with large-type enemies and it'll be a long time before enemies will give Petrify Grenades again";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:18 PM;"As they are immensely useful. You can Use them to inflict AoE Petrify, turning Rikku (and Kimahri, in your case) into monsters. You can put Stonetouch on characters if they're having trouble doing damage. You can also put Stoneward/proof on armors which is useful because that status really fucking sucks to deal with";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:20 PM;Petrify can ruin your day really quickly.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:21 PM;So I have to go all the way back through the Moonflow path? No.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:21 PM;That still sounds onerous;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:21 PM;Alright :p;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:21 PM;Figured I'd bring it up in any case;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:23 PM;HAha. Thanks;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:23 PM;I’m cruising along so I don’t want to go back. Maybe on another playthrough.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:24 PM;Any items or weapons or armor I should look for in the next bit of the game?;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:25 PM;"And yeah, FFX is pretty nasty about the status. Not only effectively puts a member into the stunned state, if they get hit with a physical attack, they become broken, killed instantly and are removed from the battle. Which means not only are they unable to be revived, their slot is taken up so you're forced to use two members for the rest of the fight";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:27 PM;Wait. What?? A physical attack once I’m petrified takes me out of the battle totally?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:28 PM;Better get those Softs on the ready;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:28 PM;"Also, Poison is actually useful for once";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:33 PM;"Yeah. So an example would be, , [Tidus] [Lulu] [Kimahri], You fight some enemies. One of them petrifies Lulu. She can't act, at all. You don't use a Soft on her., An enemy hits Lulu. She instantly dies, her body shatters, and your lineup looks like, [Tidus[ [Empty] [Kimahri]";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:33 PM;"You can't swap anyone into the empty slot, leaving you with only two characters";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:34 PM;Right. Good grief. That sucks. I’ve been lucky so far then.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:35 PM;Yeah softs or get tidus to flee ASAP;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:35 PM;Yep;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:35 PM;"On the flip side, the enemies shatter too";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:35 PM;"Yuna should have some Stoneward armor somewhere, so she won't get hit with it";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:36 PM;"Enemies shatter instantly with Stonetouch/strike/Petrify Grenades, making it an instant kill which is 👌";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:36 PM;Yeah yeah yeah.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:37 PM;So then petrify is the scariest status effect in the game?;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:38 PM;"Petrify, Zombie and Poison, yeah";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:38 PM;Poison was ticking auron for like 500+ earlier. That shit hurts.;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:38 PM;Yeah poison deals 25% of your character's max HP every turn;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:38 PM;Oh. Didn’t know it was a specific %;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:39 PM;Makes sense since he’s around 2100 hp;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:39 PM;"Again, it's actually useful for once";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:39 PM;"Use it on Ochu's, and two certain bosses";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:39 PM;At least;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:40 PM;"It's a varying % based on the enemy, but yeah";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:40 PM;It's nice on large-type enemies;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:40 PM;"As for equipment, since you asked";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:41 PM;"Nothing special. Tidus's weapon (his special looking one) gets upgraded automatically once you hit Thunder Plains. The Brotherhood one. It goes from, Strength +5% to, Strength +5%, Strength +10%, Sensor, Waterstrike";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:42 PM;There's also a Waterball in a chest in Thunder Plains which helps Wakka;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:42 PM;"~~I've played FFX too much, help~~";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:42 PM;I think I have a waterball.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;31-Oct-18 02:43 PM;Yeah I have the brotherhood. I tried to sell it at some point and you can’t sell it so I figured it was for something;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:44 PM;The plot gave it to you;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:45 PM;"Also, you haven't played it too much, not until you're sick and tired of it";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:45 PM;#PlotPowers;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:45 PM;Like I am wifh 7;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:45 PM;"I'll never reach that level, I love it too much";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Oct-18 02:45 PM;I said the same thing concerning ff7;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:46 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:49 PM;Fair enough;;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 02:49 PM;"I don't think I'll get that way, since 7 is full of holes in lots of ways and 10 really isn't. It's really solid and tight from a gameplay aspect, the story bits don't really bother me";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 03:14 PM;"Oh yeah, I guess it falls into that purview you mentioned earlier about equipment., In the Thunder Plains, you can pray in front of stones with cactuars on them. Doing so will allow them to appear as enemies. Each stone adds one cactuar (starting at 1, capping at 3). You can steal Chocobo Feathers from them, which are great items., You can kill them easily using Lightning Marbles (stolen from enemies in Thunder Plains). Otherwise they have high evasion & magic defense, proving difficult to kill consistently., , They are likely to drop HP & MP Stroll armors, regenerating the repsective stat as you walk";;
Rasea#1840;31-Oct-18 03:15 PM;"They also give 1,500 gil per kill, which is up there";;
eluukkanen#9125;01-Nov-18 07:02 AM;Hey guys in this Final Fantasy Discord group;;
eluukkanen#9125;01-Nov-18 07:02 AM;I have a question for people who know the early part of the series more than me.;;
eluukkanen#9125;01-Nov-18 07:03 AM;"I may, or may not be developing a game that takes heavy inspiration from games like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 1 (classic games)";;
eluukkanen#9125;01-Nov-18 07:03 AM;what I want to ask from you is what are the aspects that make or break Final Fantasy (early titles like 1 and 2);;
eluukkanen#9125;01-Nov-18 07:05 AM;"if anyone of you have any thoughts of why you like or don't like those games, it would be really valuable for me.. I want to develope a new game, which ventures into old world of jrpg's.";;
Brion#4623;01-Nov-18 07:24 AM;the biggest complaints of that era of games is that plot elements may not be obvious to point you in the right direction for the next part of the story. and the leveling system for ff2 has been heavily criticized;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Nov-18 07:30 AM;FF2 didnt do it right is the thing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Nov-18 08:51 AM;It's very hard to do FF2's system right;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Nov-18 08:52 AM;"On one hand, the reality is that in FF2, playing poorly meant your characters become stronger, and, conversely, that better play resulted in weaker characters";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Nov-18 08:52 AM;"Perfect example being that if an enemy is weak to Fire and resistant to Wind, killing it with Wind spells takes more cast, thus you gain more stats, and inversely, killing it with Fire meant less casts and thus less stats";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Nov-18 08:53 AM;"At the extreme, it meant that completely unintuitive and absurd play was the better way to progress";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Nov-18 08:53 AM;i.e. the classic have your characters bop each other for hours;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Nov-18 08:54 AM;"The thing is, it's extremely hard to avoid those issues without running into others";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Nov-18 10:33 AM;Don't make the game grindy as well. Especially for the final dungeon. It should be balanced from start to finish;;
Brion#4623;01-Nov-18 10:58 AM;i think modernization of menus and quality of life items erase a lot of problems with long/intense final dungeons--e.g. tent + save point;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 12:06 PM;Anyone know how to load a save from Vita to the PS4? Game is FFX.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 12:21 PM;wait i think i got it;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Nov-18 07:37 PM;Idk what other games did FF2s progression except Alliance Alive and that game did that so much better;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 07:45 PM;Elder Scrolls games are pretty notorious for that kind of progression system;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 07:45 PM;They generally do it well;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:52 PM;How does FF2 work exactly? What’s the general progression mechanic?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:52 PM;you get stat bonuses based on how you fight;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:53 PM;"Also, jesus does Rikku have low Hp when she rejoins your party.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:53 PM;it's different for each stat;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:53 PM;"for example, you get HP the more damage you take";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:53 PM;Oh that’s interesting.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:53 PM;which is where the whole hit yourself to get HP thing comes from;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:54 PM;"So if you know you’re in control of a fight, it makes sense to dick around draw the fight out.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:54 PM;yeah;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:54 PM;Interesting. What about your offensive stats?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:54 PM;the game is so easily exploitable because of stuff like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:54 PM;I can't remember specifically for other stats;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;How do you up your spells?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;but I'm pretty sure doing more physical attacks gives more stats in that category;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;same with weapons and spells;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;So basically use them?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;it's based on uses;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;yeah;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;Ah. Ok.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:55 PM;and in the original there was an exploit where you didn't even have to cast spells;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:56 PM;just selecting it in the menu counted as a use;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:56 PM;Ha. That’s awesome.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 07:56 PM;so you can just select cancel;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 07:56 PM;Right.;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 07:56 PM;Rikku has really low health but she skyrockets quickly because her path has several HP nodes very early;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 07:57 PM;It's pretty easy to put her around ~1500 in a few battles when you get her at Moonflow;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 07:57 PM;Any HP Spheres you get also can help boost her up if you don't use them on Lulu or Yuna;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 08:00 PM;I had one Hp sphere and used it on Tidus actually because he was lagging earlier;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 08:01 PM;But yeah I took Rikku from 360 to 760 pretty quickly.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 08:01 PM;I’m already through Guadosalam.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Nov-18 08:01 PM;Seymour is a straight up creeper;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 08:03 PM;That he be;;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 08:04 PM;"Yeah, Rikku starts at 360. She has... five HP nodes, totaling 1,360 HP in her first cluster";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Nov-18 08:05 PM;"`Seymour is a straight up creeper`, , :GWqlabsKek: :GWqlabsFeelsFunnyMan: :GWjojoGachiGASM: You have no idea";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Nov-18 08:05 PM;I've said too much;;
Thelitedragon#4507;01-Nov-18 08:07 PM;"Oh yeah, *that* scene";;
Rasea#1840;01-Nov-18 08:08 PM;Lmao;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Nov-18 08:28 PM;"Funny thing is, I wasn't referring to a specific scene.";;
Brion#4623;01-Nov-18 08:59 PM;For ff2 there is a point system based on spell uses. Something like 3 pts for first use in a battle and one point for each additional use. 100 points is a level up;;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:31 AM;Thanks for important feedback everybody! I will be using your points when developing;;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:35 AM;"avoiding grind has been one thing on my mind, and connecting gaining experience to how really you gain it in real world.";;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:36 AM;like one example: Skyrim. You can smith the same dagger over and over again and get the highest level in smithing very fast;;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:37 AM;but how you really gain experience in real life is much more connected to finding new experiences you haven't encountered before.;;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:38 AM;I have been thinking this as a concept from the basis of FF2 system where you gained stat depending no your actions.;;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:41 AM;"In a game I am doing, you get experience from actions you take that are new. When you do, let's say, smith a dagger, you get exp.. But if you choose to craft the same dagger, it would give lessexp every time.";;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:41 AM;Having a system that rewards you less and less when you repeate the same thing over and over again would take the grind fully away and reward doing new actions perhaps.;;
eluukkanen#9125;02-Nov-18 12:42 AM;Let me know if you have any problems with what I just said. I am still working on the system and any helpful feedback will impact it a lot;;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:46 AM;"Well, the thing to realize about any system is that every system is going to have its flaws. Focus on making a good one. Determine if you're okay with abuse of that system, and try to minimalize it. More important than that, however, is to not make it tedious. A breakable game is better than a tedious game";;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:47 AM;"More specifically, systems like those run into issues. Progression based ones, that is., , In the case of Skyrim, you have that dagger example. It was most efficient to level smithing that way, yes. But it also is highly repetitive and some people didn't do it. They also nerfed exp gains from it, which meant leveling smithing became more lucrative if you smithed jewelry. Which became tedious because getting those materials can be tedious";;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:49 AM;"That system you mentioned also has issues. Mainly, you effectively punish grinding (which isn't good in most cases) and force people to use different methods to further progression. And, of course, you have to make sure doing different things constantly is worth it, that's it's not hard to keep track of, and that doing so (such as gathering materials to level a trade skill) doesn't become tedious";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:49 AM;I'll go straight to my point;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:49 AM;I think usage-based progression systems are a monstrosity;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:49 AM;They can almost never reconcile good play *and* good progression;;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;I'm inclined to agree;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;As I highlighted for FF2 earlier;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;:tabata:;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;"Sorry, yeah, I agree";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;"Now, let's take your ideas into consideration, @eluukkanen#9125";;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;"They tend to be repetitive and grindy, and often tend to break the game and aren't very interactive";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;"Sure, you can't *spam* the same thing to level up";;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;"They can work, though";;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;Progression based systems tend to reward repetitive grinding;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;But;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:50 AM;"But if you want to progress, you're forced to changed to stuff that probably isn't optimal";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:51 AM;"Let's say you're in an Ice dungeon, you're *bound* to use a lot of Fire spells";;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Nov-18 12:51 AM;"When systems are put into place to prevent that from happening, you end up creating complexity";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:51 AM;That's the *right* play;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:52 AM;"Yet as you go through the dungeon, a player might be inclined to not do that for the exact same reasons as in the original FF2";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:52 AM;"In essence, you've solved the I can spam this shit to level up issue, but the Playing well means being underleveled, playing poorly means better leveling issue remains, and you've added  a I'm forced to switch strategies *for no reason* issue";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:53 AM;"The more you try to avoid issue inherent to usage-based systems, the more you create complexity and obscurity";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:54 AM;"And not in a good way, because I think progression systems should be clear";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:54 AM;I take particular issue with the play well = less XP thing;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;02-Nov-18 12:55 AM;I think the idea of being better at things u use more often is a great idea but i think that shouldve only been done with weapons and spells and stats shouldve been made by level up;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:55 AM;Because games that don't reward good play well enough stick out like crazy to me;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:55 AM;But ones that pretty much *punish* good play ? Absurd;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;02-Nov-18 12:56 AM;I think spells shouldve been wprked differently but i think weapons was a good idea;;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:56 AM;"That reminds me that Skyrim and Oblivion functioned that way. Oblivion is very easy if you never level up, and Skyrim remains easy if you level as few skills as possible since it raises your own level. Enemies scale with your level all the time, so if you level too quickly, you can effectively get stuck because your equipment sucks and you can't deal with combat";;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;02-Nov-18 12:56 AM;Stats r atrocious;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:57 AM;"I think I've mentioned that once, but the *only* good scaling system I've seen is in KH2";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:57 AM;"It's very simple, yet intelligent";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:57 AM;"I don't think it's proper to call it scaling, but the effects are similar";;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 12:57 AM;What system is that?;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;02-Nov-18 12:57 AM;I personally like ff2 its not as bad as people say imo but i definatley see why people dislike it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:57 AM;KH2's scaling system is based on its damage formula;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:58 AM;It's a simple formula : (STR of attacker - DEF of target) x ATKMultiplier of attack x Difficulty Multiplier x Elemental Multiplier;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:59 AM;"It works for enemies and Sora the same, except STR becomes Magic when you use a Magic attack";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:59 AM;"Simple enough, right ?";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 12:59 AM;"Well if you recall (if you've played it) KH2, every area has a Battle Level";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:00 AM;"It's not an indication, it's the actual source of enemies and bosses' HP, ATK, DEF";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:00 AM;"So all enemies at Battle Level 50 have the same DEF, for example (it's 26)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:01 AM;"Now, Battle Level also determines Damage Caps and Damage Floors, for both damage taken and damage inflicted";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:01 AM;That's where the scaling is;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:01 AM;These caps and floors apply *only* to the STR-DEF part of the formula;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:02 AM;"For example, Battle Level 50 has 6-15 as a damage range";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:02 AM;"That means that as long as your STR/MAG isn't 6+ higher than enemy's DEF, you will deal the same damage";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:02 AM;"Because in the formula, this part will be brought up to 6";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:03 AM;"Similarly, no matter how much you might be overleveled, you'll see no difference in the damage you deal once your STR/MAG goes 15 over the enemy's DEF (which is 26, so past 41 makes no difference)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:04 AM;What I like about this system is that it only scales  the game up/down to your level up to a certain point;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:05 AM;"Which means that purposefully staying low (like in FF8) is not particularly beneficial, and overleveling, while definitely helpful, isn't as powerful";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:05 AM;"Most importantly, it's what makes the game *doable* at Level 1";;
Rasea#1840;02-Nov-18 01:11 AM;"Huh, didn't know that. I've played a bunch of KH2, but I've never dipped into the mechanics of things";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:12 AM;"I did so only fairly recently (about 3 months ago, when I played KH2FM HD)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;02-Nov-18 01:12 AM;"The biggest source for such info is in Japanese, so no wonder it's hard to come by if you don't know where to look";;
qlip#0001;02-Nov-18 05:17 AM;"Ok, I know about the overflow glitch in ff7, but I thought it was impossible on ruby weapon due to his ridiculously high defence. The guy doesn’t even overflow and still kills ruby in only a few hits? , , https://youtube.com/watch?v=QnT8-q0ulvQ";;
qlip#0001;02-Nov-18 05:17 AM;Tf?;;
Perrydice#9311;02-Nov-18 05:31 AM;Yeah but doesn't it require killing a ton of enemies with Vincent?;;
qlip#0001;02-Nov-18 06:32 AM;"Yeah, like 60k with death penalty";;
qlip#0001;02-Nov-18 06:34 AM;I would’ve thought 8 kotr on missing score w/deathblow on armour + berserk + a couple hero drinks would work on ruby too;;
Perrydice#9311;02-Nov-18 08:03 AM;"I usually use Cloud... have the W-Summon materia connected with HP Absorb materia and then use 4 hero drinks on yourself, and then use Hades, and KotR, and just mime it over and over until you win.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Nov-18 05:48 PM;I usually use the game over screen and move on to a different FF;;
Deep#9598;02-Nov-18 05:57 PM;"I'm guessing we all use the w-summon kotr hades mime trick, huh";;
pokemongenius#1474;02-Nov-18 05:58 PM;No one actually wants to spend a year fighting Ruby;;

D34DLY4SS4SS1N#8131;05-Nov-18 12:28 AM;anyone know how I can get past the intro for final fantasy x international? playing on pcsx2 and the begginning cutscene takes so long;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 12:29 AM;Not sure what you mean by get past. Can you not just wait out the cutscenes?;;
D34DLY4SS4SS1N#8131;05-Nov-18 12:30 AM;I would like to not have to go through that slog again;;
D34DLY4SS4SS1N#8131;05-Nov-18 12:30 AM;even speeding it up would be preferable;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 12:34 AM;"There are speedup options within PCSX2. Turbo or something, I think it's called. As long as your PC can handle it. Otherwise, it's not skippable to my knowledge";;
D34DLY4SS4SS1N#8131;05-Nov-18 12:34 AM;ok;;
D34DLY4SS4SS1N#8131;05-Nov-18 12:34 AM;thabks for helping;;

Samantha Rose#2102;05-Nov-18 06:33 AM;"Maybe i have a better chance of getting an answer in here ^^ Can you Still Play World of Final Fantasy after you beat the storyline? Like Still hunt mirages you don't have, or higher lvl ones, and online duels and stuff?";;
Malfred#1000;05-Nov-18 06:43 AM;Copy-pasta response from #general;;
Malfred#1000;05-Nov-18 06:43 AM;"You can, There's some DLC stuff and a handful of superbosses, if I recall correctly, The only online stuff in WoFF is in the Colisseum where you can fight others., Dunno how populated it is these days";;

Kenshin-Sensei#5375;05-Nov-18 07:29 PM;What about Type-0 😂;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 07:51 PM;I’d say start with 6 or 10;;
Starlight Razor#8336;05-Nov-18 11:49 PM;"I know I'm late, but I will always shamelessly recommend 6.";;
Malfred#1000;06-Nov-18 02:52 AM;IX is also a good choicw;;
Malfred#1000;06-Nov-18 02:53 AM;Especially if you then play other FFs before returning to IX;;
Starlight Razor#8336;06-Nov-18 03:12 AM;I do love 9 as well.;;
rickmenso#2139;06-Nov-18 03:56 AM;9 on switch 2019;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:13 AM;"@Kenshin-Sensei#5375 For my first one, I honestly would suggest Final Fantasy IV. It's the easiest one to follow, teaches you the ATB mechanics which are in 5-9, has a streamlined progression system so it isn't too customizable that it overwhelms the player, especially a newcomer or novice to RPGs, and has a plot worth something. It also has some really good characters and one of the best OSTs. Some of my favorite FF songs come from IV.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:14 AM;"If you don't like the older games, maybe start with Final Fantasy X. It's much more linear so you aren't confused on where to go and the game is really customizable because of the swap mechanic. It also has good music and I do like Tidus as a main character.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:15 AM;"And yes, Type-0 is hot garbage, too. I would say FFXIII is a little better, and I do not like FFXIII.";;
Kenshin-Sensei#5375;06-Nov-18 05:27 AM;"@Perrydice#9311 yeah i understand when i compared the prices with FF X and FF XIII 😂  , and after all i will choose FF X";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:45 AM;Lol;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:46 AM;"I am not the biggest fan of the overall story, but what it lacks in story, it makes up in gameplay.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Nov-18 07:20 AM;I kinda like the story. Cliche but endearing in some strange way.;;

rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:20 PM;8 for steam ok;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:20 PM;but i dont have a snes;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:20 PM;i do have a vita though;;
Rasea#1840;10-Nov-18 03:20 PM;You can emulate it just fine;;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 03:21 PM;"VI on the GBA fixes a bunch of gameplay and localisation issues for VI on the SNES, but it doesn't entirely do the game justice. The gameboy soundfont is worse than the SNES and there's a performance limitation because of the smaller resolution";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:21 PM;yes thats the problem with vi thats why i asked;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:22 PM;snes bad translation;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:22 PM;gba bad sound;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:22 PM;steam/phone bad graphics;;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 03:23 PM;"Unfortunately, you have to pick the one you want where you can put up with the problems";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:23 PM;playstation has something too but dont know what;;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 03:23 PM;Playstation has load times;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:23 PM;even on vita?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;10-Nov-18 03:24 PM;yes;;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 03:24 PM;The playstation 1 anthology version;;
Thelitedragon#4507;10-Nov-18 03:24 PM;It's just an emulation of the PS1 so it has the exact same problem;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:25 PM;forget that 7 (original no upcomming) ps4 version they should have done/fixed vi;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:27 PM;@rickmenso#2139 play VI on Vita.;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:27 PM;why;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:27 PM;im close to getting a gba emulator;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:27 PM;It’s true to the original. The load times bother some people but I didn’t find them that bad.;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:28 PM;i just wait for a sale then;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:28 PM;same with viii;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:28 PM;I’ve been playing I-X all on Vita and it’s been great.;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:28 PM;but lets be real those guys 80% of the time on sale on december anyway;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:29 PM;steam i mean;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:29 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 i played x on vita which i loved (still need to get motivation to play x-2 though);;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 03:32 PM;"If you haven't played VI before, the anthology version is not bad. But if you have, the loading times do bother you";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:32 PM;i havent played them;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:33 PM;"i only played 13, 13-2, 13 lightning returns,x, a bit of dissidia duodecim, world of final fantasy ps4 now playing world of final fantasy maxima switch";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:34 PM;and if you count it (most likely not) kingdom hearts;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:37 PM;so if you have some final fantasy games to reccomend im all ears;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:39 PM;Oh Jesus are you in for some treats.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:40 PM;Play IV - VII;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:40 PM;All on vita.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:40 PM;IX too. Haven’t played that one though. It’s on my short list though.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:41 PM;"Yeah if you’ve played X on Vita and were ok with those load times, VI isn’t much different";;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 03:42 PM;"Let me say this. If you want to get into IX, it's a good thing you're used to the load times of the vita ports";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:42 PM;i just get the switch version of ix;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:42 PM;Cool. I don’t find them that bad.;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:42 PM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIXwYlnoHv4;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 03:43 PM;"If you play VII on Vita, keep the disc speed set to normal. Setting it to fast brings in a lot of bugs and glitches.";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:43 PM;ok;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 03:44 PM;also just saying i wont play 15;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 04:12 PM;i think i wont like the gameplay of that one;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 04:42 PM;Ditto.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;10-Nov-18 04:43 PM;"I’m not going to play 11, 13, 14, or 15";;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:44 PM;"You'll rarely find anyone who'll recommend XI and XIV anyway, when asking which FFs to try out";;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:44 PM;Given that they are very different;;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:45 PM;"Both are great games, but require that you like MMOs.. And most newcomers to FF tend to be looking for singleplayer experiences.";;
karuuuu♉#0520;10-Nov-18 04:47 PM;"for XIV you have to pay month to month, right?";;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:47 PM;"There's a free trial, but that only allows you to play up to level 35";;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:47 PM;After that you have to purchase the game and pay a subscription;;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:48 PM;Same goes for XI;;
karuuuu♉#0520;10-Nov-18 04:48 PM;hmmm that's what I though;;
karuuuu♉#0520;10-Nov-18 04:48 PM;thanksssss;;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 04:52 PM;It's amazing that XI is still functioning;;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:52 PM;Had a pretty solid base;;
Malfred#1000;10-Nov-18 04:53 PM;"And despite never having WoW numbers of players, it was a stable earner for SE for a long-ass time";;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 04:57 PM;"Yeah. And people still play it today. They still update it for minor things, if I recall";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:39 PM;i also find world of final fantasy is underrated;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:41 PM;but yeah you shouldn't reccomend ff 11 12 13 14;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:41 PM;11=dead;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:42 PM;14=mmo so you reccomend that if people want mmo not a final fantasy;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:42 PM;12 is more wating and a lot diffirent from the rest of the series;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:43 PM;13 well 13-2 was my first game i liked it then still do but its really linaire but worse than that the story;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 05:44 PM;you play 3 games but the story aint that great (i really hated lightning returns);;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Nov-18 06:03 PM;"If a character dies in battle in FFX, is their Overdrive gauge emptied, or does it stay where it is ?";;
Rasea#1840;10-Nov-18 06:12 PM;It stays;;
Rasea#1840;10-Nov-18 06:12 PM;And Niji finally got a color;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Nov-18 06:13 PM;Yeah;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Nov-18 06:13 PM;"I gave up on asking for one of FFXIII's Roles to be added, so I just picked something purple";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Nov-18 06:14 PM;And thanks for your answer;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 06:15 PM;is it worth playing 10-2;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Nov-18 06:17 PM;"If you're not bothered by fanservice, the game being a parody of FFX, the mission format";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;10-Nov-18 06:17 PM;Maybe;;
Rasea#1840;10-Nov-18 06:18 PM;"What Niji said. It's a fun game with a great combat system, but it's fanservice, the story is subpar at best and some of the changes are dumb";;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 06:30 PM;i have a bad feeling when they make 10-3;;
Deep#9598;10-Nov-18 06:38 PM;Tidus goes boom;;
rickmenso#2139;10-Nov-18 06:52 PM;i hope the series goes back to being turn based;;
Rasea#1840;10-Nov-18 06:52 PM;Most of the games aren't turn based though so unlikely;;
Trickster#9840;10-Nov-18 06:55 PM;Go back to atb based at least;;
retro#9624;10-Nov-18 08:28 PM;Hey how do u cure imp in ff6;;
Rasea#1840;10-Nov-18 08:31 PM;Cast Imp on the character again;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 04:36 AM;Either atb or x battle system;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 04:36 AM;It's really sad turn based is dying out;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 04:37 AM;Let's hope ff 16 will bring it back;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 05:08 AM;There have been more turn-based games in the past 5 years that during the 5 years before;;
qlip#0001;11-Nov-18 05:26 AM;"Anyone know the cover of the extreme in this video? Thanks., , https://youtube.com/watch?v=Uu-IixCjh34&index=17&list=PL3WrE8Yj7r0E8DE8ZdITLmb2erpLs4jWZ&t=975s";;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 06:26 AM;Extreme what?;;
qlip#0001;11-Nov-18 06:41 AM;"The extreme, as in the name of the track that has been modded";;
qlip#0001;11-Nov-18 06:47 AM;"Never mind, found it, and it has the ogg file too.";;
Trickster#9840;11-Nov-18 07:34 AM;"Idk about turn based dying out, persona 5 and dq11 have both shown it can still be done and sell well";;
Trickster#9840;11-Nov-18 09:17 AM;Granted with ffxv sales they probably won't go back to it;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 10:01 AM;I think it is less a matter of sales and more a matter of evolution/progress;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 10:02 AM;"Going back to turn-based/atb combat in the main numbered titles, could be seen as a regression, and would get the game and SE bad press, regardless of how well it turns out.";;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 10:03 AM;They seem contend with giving us fans turn-based/atb combat in various spin-off and smaller titles instead.;;
satwit#4577;11-Nov-18 10:40 AM;"While I do miss turn-based/atb, I have heard people call them out dated systems";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Nov-18 11:04 AM;They're not outdated but that gameplay style doesn't work for everything;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Nov-18 11:04 AM;Limited and most of all it just doesn't have a big enough appeal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Nov-18 11:05 AM;Square is looking to appeal to as many people as possible (fans or not);;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:26 AM;turn based is for tactical;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:27 AM;but those days people only want to mash buttons becauce they dont have the brains for it;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:27 AM;sorry i mean:;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:27 AM;people want more interactive games;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Nov-18 11:27 AM;People are too impatient.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:28 AM;Most turn based games are tactical only up to the point you know them well;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:28 AM;I mean I just mashed buttons in ATB games too;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:28 AM;"And even then, some aren't";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;Let's not pretend that the early FF games were the Dark Souls of JRPGs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;"Either because they're too easy, too broken, not varied enough, too focused on character building, or a combination of those";;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;I dunno;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;in the past we analyzed bossess and super bosses and looked at there patterns;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;FFIV rekt my shit back in the day;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;"lmao, like you can't do that now rick";;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;now its just attack attack attack;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;Like you really did that too;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;Most past superbosses could also just be violently overpowered;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;Niji can tell you all about analysing superbosses in XIII :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Perrydice#9311;11-Nov-18 11:29 AM;@rickmenso#2139 like XIII.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:30 AM;Riiiiight;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:30 AM;(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:30 AM;Maybe you ought to know a bit more about a game before talking about it;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:30 AM;its just when you make it an actions game it takes a lot of that away;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:30 AM;"Also you makin' fun of me, Joker ? :sepho:";;
Babiesonyourface#3482;11-Nov-18 11:30 AM;:doggo:;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:31 AM;i dont dislike action games i love my kingdom hearts and tales of (though didnt like the last 2);;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:31 AM;Reminder that optimal superboss strats in FFX were spamming Quick Hit and having just the right equipment setup to survive without doing anything;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:31 AM;but if i think of final fantasy i think of turn based;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:31 AM;"Or in international version, throwing 8 gil at Yojimbo for a 50% chance of Zanmato";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:32 AM;(Terms and conditions apply);;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:33 AM;You can usually cheese the shit out of superbosses;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:33 AM;I beat X by spamming Yojimbo;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:34 AM;I intend to make a video of me beating every boss past a certain point in X;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:34 AM;Using only Yojimbo's Zanmato that cost 8 gil;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:34 AM;Just to highlight how dumb that is;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:34 AM;so what do you guys think about 7 remake;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:35 AM;"I hope it has better combat than XV, because that was painful to play";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:35 AM;what 7 remake?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:35 AM;"Never gonna happen ;)";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:35 AM;I didn't think that they would dumb it down as much as they did in XV;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:36 AM;Hold down the O button to blitz an enemy;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:36 AM;???????;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:36 AM;what do you think of the gameplay story episode release format and the like;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:37 AM;Episodic release makes sense considering the scale of the game;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:37 AM;But I don't understand how it's gonna work with character progression;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:37 AM;Surely they'd have to account for someone who *has* played the previous episode not to lose their progress;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:37 AM;But also for someone who hasn't;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:38 AM;not per se;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:38 AM;they can make it so episode 2 can only be played if you have the first one;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:39 AM;another way is that you get your progress and bonus items if you played the previous one;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:39 AM;They could just keep the system that they had from the original game;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:39 AM;and give you standard stuff if you only got the second one;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:39 AM;A single savegame for all discs;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:42 AM;We'll see;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 11:42 AM;"As long as progress isn't lost between episodes, I don't think there's an issue";;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:42 AM;dont think they will;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:43 AM;becauce some people will play the hell out of it and get lv99 on disk one;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:43 AM;so i think they wil limit some stuff;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:44 AM;Well I mean nothing was stopping people from doing that in the original game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:44 AM;"It's not like they really care about that happening, it's not a multiplayer title";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:44 AM;Actually knowing Square they're gonna make some downright boneheaded decisions;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:46 AM;actually i think they will and i may have an idea on how they dot it;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:46 AM;lets say they make 3 episodes;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:46 AM;disk 1 max lv 33;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:46 AM;disk2 66;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:46 AM;disk3 99;;

rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:48 AM;lets just hope the gameplay and story will be good;;

Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:50 AM;I just wish they didn't reveal it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;Square always reveals things way too early;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;with the remake yes;;
satwit#4577;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;Agreed;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;and XV;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;And XIII;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;And KH3;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;Never forget KH3;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:51 AM;with kh no becauce people would think they cancelled it without announcement;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 11:52 AM;That doesn't make sense though;;
satwit#4577;11-Nov-18 11:52 AM;But you know someone would have leaked it anyway;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 11:52 AM;"Well, without an announcement there would be no worry about cancellation either";;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:52 AM;depends;;
rickmenso#2139;11-Nov-18 11:52 AM;but i agree the ff announcements should have waited;;
FireProne#0537;11-Nov-18 02:05 PM;"Anyone who play final fantasy v know how to catch monsters? There's this old man I found in a well in Quelb who wants a frog, but I have to catch one and everytime I try it says enemy is too strong so am i supposed to weaken it then try catching it?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Nov-18 02:07 PM;yes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Nov-18 02:07 PM;either that or be above the level but I'm pretty sure it just has to be at low health from what I remember;;
Trickster#9840;11-Nov-18 02:17 PM;Low health. 1/8 remaining iirc;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 02:55 PM;"Yeah, 1/8th health remaining. It's a pain trying to get that naturally. If you picked up Death Claw, it makes it a lot easier to catch monsters as it automatically puts the enemy at single digit health and paralyzes them";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 02:56 PM;"Also I agree with Ultima. ARPGs and such just appeal to more people than turn based games do. DQ11 did break 4m sales worldwide, but it also has a lot of brandpower behind it. FF does too, but DQ doesn't have any controversial games stinking up the series";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 02:57 PM;"I'm also of the opinion that ATB isn't great. It's subjective, but I feel that turn based gaming gives more weight to the actions of yourself and of the enemies. It's also a lot easier to balance. ATB being fast paced also typically means you spam attack the whole game or lower the threat of most enemies because you're often not strategizing to deal with enemies either";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 02:58 PM;"You also don't get cases like FF3 or DQ in general where bosses can get multiple turns, making them genuine threats";;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 02:58 PM;Well.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 02:59 PM;"Set the ATB games that allow it, to Wait and you don't have to rush.";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:00 PM;But you still do. It only pauses when you're selecting a target or selecting magic or something. This still causes you to rush through the commands rather than figuring out the proper strategy yourself. And also why most ATB games in FF are just attack fests;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 03:00 PM;Uh.. no.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:00 PM;:whaaaaaaa:;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 03:00 PM;That's for the active modes.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 03:01 PM;"In Wait mode you have to decide on an action, before anything else happens.";;
Malfred#1000;11-Nov-18 03:01 PM;"Or well, it sets up a queue, but you know what I mean";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:02 PM;"Yes, but not if you're just looking at the commands. If you're in the, Attack, Magic, Item, Defend, , Menu, then the battle progresses. It will only pause the ATB gauges when you press attack and are choosing a target. Or when you press magic and are in the magic menu";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:05 PM;"If we're talking turn-based, I much prefer FFX's system to any form of turn-based ATB";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:05 PM;"Another thing I dislike about ATB. That only seems to be a thing for FFIV, is actions having wait time. I know magic has a short wait time in FFVI, but some actions have a buildup gauge after choosing them, which means waiting even longer for it to happen. Like Palom & Porom's Dualcast, or strong magic., , I guess you could see Cyan's SwordTech as being a long ass wait gauge";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:05 PM;Same;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:06 PM;CTB 👌;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:06 PM;"It makes action order, turn order (present and future) much clearer, and gives a more nuanced action-cost to your actions";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:06 PM;Another turn-based tactic I like is having a turn bank;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:06 PM;Like Press Turn ?;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:06 PM;"Being that when a character's turn comes up, you can choose to act then or select a pass/wait command, skipping their turn entirely. Then once their turn comes up, they can act twice instead of once";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:07 PM;Saving up to X amount of turns;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:07 PM;Adds a nice layer of strategy;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:07 PM;Yeah that's pretty much SMT's Press Turn system;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:07 PM;"Except Pass costs a bit, otherwise you could really lay out the destruction too easily";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:08 PM;I don't have a frame of reference for that. Why is multiple turns too strong there?;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:08 PM;"Or could be, rather";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:08 PM;"You haven't played an SMT game, right ?";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:08 PM;"Logically speaking, you get the same amount of turns. You can just either choose to spend them normally or save them up to burst them all out X turns later";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:08 PM;"I haven't, no";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:08 PM;Alright;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:09 PM;"In SMT games with Press Turn, you get one Press Turn Icon per character in your team (in general)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:09 PM;One action costs an Icon;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:09 PM;"However, if your action hits an enemy weakness, or critically hits, then you gain *back* a *half* icon";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:10 PM;"A half icon can be used like a full icon, except it does not allow you to gain a half icon";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:10 PM;"Essentially, in games with 4 slots in the party, that means up to 8 actions when your team acts";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:10 PM;Ohhhh;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:10 PM;I could see how that would be too strong;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:10 PM;I was assuming that you couldn't gain extra turns or anything. A la FFX;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:10 PM;Passing costs a half icon;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;However;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;SMT makes up for that by being harder than any FF I've ever played :trolltabata:;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;Joker likes hard things confirmed;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;You know me bby;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;Or your hit misses;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;C'est la vie;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;You lose an *additional* icon;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:11 PM;Take every day at a time;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:12 PM;"Anyway, if passing in SMT was free, you could pass until you got to the one party member with the spell strong against the enemy's weakness, and hit it 8 times in a single team turn";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:12 PM;"If you want to hit an enemy's weakness 8 times in a team turn, you have to set up your party correctly for that instead";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:25 PM;It's not awful;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:26 PM;One slot if your party is reserved to an ally chosen at random in a pool of accompanying characters;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:27 PM;"It acts on its own, based on their very small pool of abilities";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:27 PM;"Imagine the first major boss, who's immune to fire";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:27 PM;Imagine randomly getting the ally that uses fire;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:28 PM;Not too bad until you learn that SMT4 has a new mechanic called Smirk;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:28 PM;"Remember, Rasea, when I said that hitting an enemy's immunity is punishing ?";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:28 PM;Smirk is the fucking worst;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:28 PM;Well it's doubly so in SMT4;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:28 PM;Because then the enemy might Smirk;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:29 PM;"A Smirking character can not miss, has higher crit chance, deals higher damage, and dodges easier";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:29 PM;"The first boss has an attack that's specifically low-hit rate, high-crit chance";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:29 PM;"In short, you start the fight, you see the fire-using ally, you can just reset your game";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:29 PM;Here's even worse;;

Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:31 PM;"There's a lot of stories of people who literally could not get past the first part of IV, it was that bad";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:31 PM;I could go on about how SMT4's mechanics are awful;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Nov-18 03:31 PM;The balancing for the beginning dungeon was just tragic;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:32 PM;"Two stats that serve the same purpose but one is unarguably better, no fusion restriction means stats matter even more, no defensive stats";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:32 PM;That does sound awful;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:33 PM;The first dungeon is absolutely tragic;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:33 PM;I know multiple SMT players who called it The worst thing to happen to the series;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:35 PM;Isn't there a SMT5 coming sometime soon? I thought it was;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:36 PM;There is;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:36 PM;Yeah;;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:36 PM;All the more reason for me to get one;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:37 PM;I honestly hope some of the mechanics from SMT4 and 4A stay;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:37 PM;"But considering how the series went, they're probably gonna be replaced";;
Rasea#1840;11-Nov-18 03:37 PM;What mechanics did you like from SMT4?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:37 PM;The way your MC learns abilities;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:38 PM;"When a demon in your party learns its last ability, your MC is allowed to learn any of its abilities";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:38 PM;But only at that moment;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:38 PM;And some can't be passed;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:38 PM;"And if you re-learn a skill you already have, you'll slightly improve it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:39 PM;You're also restricted because you only have 8 slots IIRC;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:39 PM;I found it a much better system than SMT3's magatama;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:40 PM;"Or Oh you didn't equip the right thing at the right level up, this skill is now inaccessible";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:41 PM;"Other mechanic I liked, but this one from SMT4A";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:41 PM;"Demons have affinities (positive or negative) to certain types of skills, and these affinities improve or weaken abilities of the same type";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:42 PM;SMT4 had no such restriction;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;11-Nov-18 03:42 PM;SMT4A introduced that as a middle ground;;

sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:03 PM;Is there a battle mechanics guide for WoFF out there anywhere?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:04 PM;not that I know of;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:05 PM;"what do you need help with, I have not played it in a long time but I still remember some things (as long as it isn't Maxima specific stuff)";;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:08 PM;"Right now I'm just curious how the stat buff/debuff spells work.  What's the diff between Strength Up and Bravery?  Do Strength Up effects stack or have a duration?  If different Champs grant Strength Up (Sephiroth, Lightning, etc) is there any difference between these effects?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:11 PM;"I think strength up is a flat boost but I could be wrong, Bravery is percentage based";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:12 PM;"the two should stack but I don't remember how long the latter lasts, the former is usually based on a condition";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:12 PM;and as far as I know there are no differences between them in regards to champion summons;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:13 PM;"By stack, I mean do the effects stack with themselves.  Like if I spam that Carbuncle ability that grants Defense/Magic Defense Up, will they keep adding flat boosts?";;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:14 PM;"Okay, so reading the abilities on the wiki";;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:14 PM;"Strength Up raises the actual Strength stat, which would impact all things that Strength is factored into";;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:14 PM;Literally same 😂;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:14 PM;Bravery raises only physical damage;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:15 PM;When I help people I furiously search the wiki;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:15 PM;Same tbh;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:15 PM;🙏;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:15 PM;What else does Strength affect other than physical damage?;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:19 PM;I suppose I could test the stacking thing myself too;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:20 PM;Okay so judging from how STR works in most FF games;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:20 PM;The basic formula is usually something like STR - enemy's DEF = damage or something. It's basically used to calculate damage dealt. Some weapons have specific damage outputs which cannot be modified except by raising their STR stat;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:21 PM;So I guess that Strength Up would help certain equipment to be better that Bravery may not effect;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:21 PM;It also seems it has something to do with one's accuracy?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:22 PM;I don't remember it doing so;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:23 PM;"In some games it does, but FF changes how things work a lot so >_>";;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:30 PM;The other thing I'm a bit confused about has to do with mirage boards;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:31 PM;There are spaces that unlock transfigurations that have an obvious effect.  What about spaces that unlock mirage board (X) where X is a different transfiguration of that mirage;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:31 PM;Doesn't transfig give you access to the different boards anyway?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:40 PM;that's not the same as the usual transfiguration;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:40 PM;unlock mirage board gives you access to an alternate version of the same mirage;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:40 PM;the other transfigurations are part of that monster's evolution chain;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;"Right, but to use that alternate version I have to transfig it, and the abilities don't carry over as normal (though you get a buncha AP relative to its level)";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;yeah;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;So effectively what are the unlock nodes doing;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;Since I have to transfig anyway to see any changes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;it's there purely to give access;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;and nothing else;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:41 PM;"So if I unlock the board but I can't transfig yet, what happens";;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:42 PM;"As much as I can remember, nothing";;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:42 PM;But unlocking transfig gives me board access too;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:42 PM;So what's the point of the unlock board node lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:43 PM;it's treated as a different monster entirely;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:43 PM;like for example;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:43 PM;*incoherent ramble about how it still makes more sense than XVs ascension board*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:43 PM;there are two types of Tonberries;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:43 PM;green type and white type;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:44 PM;both have their own evolutions but you can switch between the individual types;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:44 PM;the game will just treat them as different monsters which is why you have to spend your AP again;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:45 PM;How can you say that Joker;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:45 PM;"so unlock mirage board does nothing but give you access to that alternative type (in the case of Tonberries, the white one is alternate)";;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:45 PM;It's literally just basically a webbed skill tree;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:45 PM;transfiguring into a more evolved version of a monster is different;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:46 PM;It's not because it's complicated but it just didn't have the same kind of sense of progression;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:47 PM;That the sphere grid and license board offered;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:47 PM;That and the absurd numbers of AP you needed for the good abilities was a huge cockblock;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:47 PM;I've stopped trying to understand what the unlock board nodes mean in practice because this Kill 10 Sand Worms miniventure is fucking bullshit;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:47 PM;"Oh, fair enough";;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:47 PM;Gaining AP in XV felt really slow and didn't really feel like I got new things;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;Other than the uh... technique move things;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;basically it gives you a different monster;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;Those were cool;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;that is similar to what you have;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;You know what else about XV felt very slow?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;The whole fucking game;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;Lmfaooooo;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;I fucking knew you were going there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;when you go to transfigure both the evolutions and the alternate versions will be in the same menu;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;I couldn't get into FFXV much like I couldn't get into any open world game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;*shouts from the top of the nearest high mountain*;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;"Couldn't focus on any one thing, tried to do too much and got bored";;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:48 PM;I HATE FFXV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:49 PM;It didn't feel slow it just had no worthwhile content;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:50 PM;I rushed the story and skipped most of the non story related content for later and then realized there was nothing to save;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Nov-18 09:50 PM;I hate FFXIII.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:50 PM;Idk ultima it felt slow in every way for me;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:50 PM;Fighting - took way too long;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:51 PM;Driving - took way too long;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:51 PM;Fast travel - too way too long;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:51 PM;Story that I don't give a shit about - took way too long;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:51 PM;"See, I disagree with one point there";;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;The fighting taking too long. I actually enjoyed that. Particularly the Iron Giants and Red Giants. I liked that they could kick my ass and I had to actually work to take them down. It was good feedback. Reinforced their sheer size and power;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;"Granted, I don't want fights like the super mountain turtle thing, but adding weight to tough enemies is something I liked about it";;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;Idk to me the fights were suuuper simple and I just beat down the bullet sponges until I won;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;Most of the time even if you suck ass you just spam items;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;I win.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;honestly every fight felt like adamantoise to me;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;MOOD;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:52 PM;"I did suck ass and I spammed items, but it was difficult for me and I enjoyed it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:53 PM;like it didn't feel like the fights had any progression;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:53 PM;I mean I guess if you felt that the enemies giving you a challenge is good;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:53 PM;and the ones that did were the summon bosses;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:53 PM;But the thing is the fact that you couldn't really die negated all challenge for me;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:53 PM;and those were automated with quick time events;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:53 PM;I died a couple of times against dungeon bosses;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;but the other bosses you fight are just as repetitive as ever to me;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;Or that one enemy that could instakill you;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;Or the Mindflayers;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;Only costlemark and the last dungeon where you couldn't use items gave me trouble;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;Mindflayers were just annoying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;the problem with dying in FFXV is that you can immediately stop time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;and use a revive;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;Each time I saw one I'd say not fucking again out loud;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:54 PM;same with healing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:55 PM;and items were easy to come by;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:55 PM;My issues with the combat would be alleviated somewhat it there was an actual DMC or NieR style combo based system that made it fun to fight;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:55 PM;so even **potential** challenges are nullified by the use of items;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;Wasn't that way for me having played the launch version but I guess that's part of my bias;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;Even for a hack and slash type thing XVs just didn't scratch that itcj;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;I played the launch version and that's how I went through the entire game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;I literally played XV unpatched because I just got my PS4 and my internet was too slow to download the patch lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;Like;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;1.00;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;"Ah, idk. I just suck then :P";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;(maybe);;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:56 PM;"And yeah, I can definitely see that Joker";;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:57 PM;Combat felt really simple to me but I guess that's what they were going for;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:57 PM;the combos were all automatic;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:57 PM;Like if they made the combat like a fun hack and slash with actual combos I'd be pretty damned pleased with it ngl;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:57 PM;just hold the attack button and noctis will act on his own doing the same attacks in a continuous cycle;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:57 PM;I didn't expect dark souls;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:57 PM;But I didn't expect hold square and circle: the game;;
Rasea#1840;12-Nov-18 09:58 PM;"Lmao, fair enough";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:58 PM;the parrying thing legit upset me;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:58 PM;"Mash the shit out of warp strikes, hold square";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:58 PM;because I treated it like how I would other games;;
Thelitedragon#4507;12-Nov-18 09:58 PM;You're untouchable;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Nov-18 09:58 PM;and then realized it wasn't timed at all;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 10:15 PM;ok I'm finding these miniventures in WoFF useless;;
sovereign110#4690;12-Nov-18 10:15 PM;"Go find and kill 5-10 rare enemies, spend 30-45 minutes doing this for a common item or two";;
sovereign110#4690;13-Nov-18 12:17 AM;"Anyway, another WoFF question.  Which mirage families are worth investing in?  Obviously that single-element trio from the beginning are pretty good, any other suggestions?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Nov-18 12:27 AM;the mechanical ones are good;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Nov-18 12:27 AM;but those are a long way ahead;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Nov-18 12:28 AM;really just use whatever looks cool tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Nov-18 12:28 AM;the game's difficulty is so relaxed that it doesn't matter since collectively every mirage is good;;
sovereign110#4690;13-Nov-18 05:35 AM;I wonder if any of these DLC mirages are worth leveling;;
sovereign110#4690;13-Nov-18 05:35 AM;That one floating mech looks cool (and strong as hell);;
rickmenso#2139;13-Nov-18 01:29 PM;so i have been playing maxima but i cant find old personal postings 1;;
sovereign110#4690;13-Nov-18 04:42 PM;Hm I think the first one I picked up was in that one town next to Nibelheim;;
sovereign110#4690;13-Nov-18 04:42 PM;Don't quote me on that though;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-Nov-18 06:24 PM;Ok. Just got past the Wendigo boss in X. He was really easy. Just had to summon Ifrit and it was game over.;;
rickmenso#2139;14-Nov-18 09:51 AM;@sovereign110#4690 you mean that town you enter later in the story?;;
rickmenso#2139;14-Nov-18 09:53 AM;forget that that was also my first one buts its post 2 im looking for post1;;
rickmenso#2139;14-Nov-18 10:07 AM;ok i found it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 05:46 PM;Ok. I got to bevelle. Am about to do the trials there. This story is getting out of hand.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 05:49 PM;"Wakka is uh, quite the guy";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 05:52 PM;"Yeah, he's kind of special there";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 05:52 PM;It's a nice turn since he gets his development around there;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 05:55 PM;Yeah I saw that.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 05:56 PM;I like how this game ramps up difficulty. It’s pretty smooth.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 05:56 PM;I won't say anything about that lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 05:56 PM;"It doesn't stay smooth, that's all I'm gonna say";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 05:57 PM;Like yo booty;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 05:57 PM;";)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 05:58 PM;Does it ramp up or down?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 05:59 PM;oh it doesn't ramp it hits you in the face;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 05:59 PM;But that's much later than Bevelle;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 05:59 PM;Don't be discouraged if some boss fights take a little while;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:03 PM;Um. Ok.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:03 PM;I’m just doing the main story;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:04 PM;"Yeah, some story bosses are real cunts";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:04 PM;"But in a wow this is challenging, nice kind of way";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:04 PM;Not Dark Souls killed you in two hits because fuck you kind of way;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:05 PM;I heard that flying boss I just shat on was a really difficult boss.;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:05 PM;Evrae? That's only if you use mainly close range fighters and neglect your long range ones;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:06 PM;It gets worse than that lol;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:06 PM;Yeah evrae;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:06 PM;Which I can't fathom because why would anyone neglect good ol' Lulu;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:06 PM;Or Wakka who was hitting that boss for a truckload;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:07 PM;Yeah him too. Wakka gets stronk;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:07 PM;Does tidus have low strength?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:07 PM;He's very fast;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;He should have haste;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;use it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;It helps a lot;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;He has the second highest strength iirc;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;He has hastaga;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;nice;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;It's really good in X;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;And slowaga;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;just because of the quirks about CTB;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;Yeah I’ve used haste and cheer a lot.;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:08 PM;"For your natural fighters, it goes something like..., , Auron > Tidus > Kimahri/Wakka";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:09 PM;Yeah auron outclasses my other peeps by a long shot when it comes to physical attacks.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;14-Nov-18 06:09 PM;"My Kimahri was weak tho, poor guy";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:09 PM;Kimahri being dependent on which tree he goes down;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:10 PM;I never used kimahri;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:10 PM;👀;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:10 PM;You took him down Rikku's iirc so he'll be behind Wakka;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:10 PM;Lombardi is my second rikku;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:10 PM;Kimahri;;
Izwar Vain#5689;14-Nov-18 06:11 PM;Lombardi?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Nov-18 06:11 PM;lol;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:12 PM;"So I’m most of the way through the game now, yes?";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:12 PM;Bevelle's around the 60% mark-ish;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:52 PM;You guys are scaring me;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 06:52 PM;With these bosses.;;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:54 PM;"Don't worry, there's really only two that are pretty difficult";;
Rasea#1840;14-Nov-18 06:54 PM;"We just mean that the difficulty keeps ramping up. It doesn't oddly stop, or raise to stupidly high levels";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Nov-18 07:50 PM;Jokes says otherwise;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Nov-18 11:34 AM;Is this Seymour fight that I’m about to get involved in one of the tough ones @Rasea#1840 ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;15-Nov-18 11:41 AM;Which one ?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Nov-18 12:21 PM;After the via purifico and underwater dead boss.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;15-Nov-18 12:38 PM;I think this one's not too hard;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Nov-18 12:52 PM;Took me a couple tries to beat that aeon battle at the end of via. I kept trying to figure out if I could cast something on Bahamut to heal him. Wasn’t working so I had to reset a couple times and then just blasted through it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Nov-18 01:07 PM;I checked out a walkthrough of the via after I got through it and saw I missed a fair number of chests. Oh well.;;
sovereign110#4690;15-Nov-18 03:05 PM;"Okay I just reached the last chapter in WoFF so I have some questions.  I have the Maxima version.  First, where the hell is the new Mecha Choco rift?  Supposed to be new to the Maxima version, and around Crystal Tower on the airship map, but I can't find anything";;
sovereign110#4690;15-Nov-18 03:06 PM;"oh nevermind, just booted up the game today and there it is lol";;
sovereign110#4690;15-Nov-18 03:06 PM;"Anyway, who are some of your preferred mirages to use at endgame?";;
Rasea#1840;15-Nov-18 03:12 PM;"The second one isn't hard, no. Relatively alright, iirc";;
Rasea#1840;15-Nov-18 03:12 PM;The third one is the bitch;;
Rasea#1840;15-Nov-18 03:12 PM;"And, hilariously, the fourth one is one of the easiest boss fights in the game";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;15-Nov-18 04:03 PM;You talking about second Seymour fight or responding to that WoFF stuff?;;
Rasea#1840;15-Nov-18 04:10 PM;Seymour;;
sovereign110#4690;15-Nov-18 04:19 PM;I'm still on the fence on whether champion jewels added in Maxima are worth it over being able to summon;;
sovereign110#4690;15-Nov-18 04:47 PM;Okay fuck this Cactuar punching minigame.  If I have to do this to progress the story I might just quit right here and now;;
sovereign110#4690;15-Nov-18 04:50 PM;"Hm I thought I hit him and quit the game, and looks like I can progress anyway?  Whatevs";;
the tree guy#5585;15-Nov-18 05:10 PM;"I brought khimari through the black mage paths for the second sphere grid but yunas Lancet still does like, 1/2 more damage:wakka:";;
Luxray#1107;15-Nov-18 06:11 PM;I'm new to the series and wondering where to start. I have 7 on my pc but I am wondering if there are any others that would be good for a newbie. Sorry if I sound like a noob;;
Izwar Vain#5689;15-Nov-18 07:42 PM;I feel like this is a party where everyone is standing along and talking to themselves lmao;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Nov-18 08:08 PM;lmao;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Nov-18 08:08 PM;Play the one you've got!;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Nov-18 08:08 PM;I think you'll be satisfied with VII if you can get over the graphics;;
rickmenso#2139;16-Nov-18 02:45 PM;i play that one when the switch port is done;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:04 PM;I’m about to take down natus Seymour. Are there any missable items coming up that I shouldn’t miss?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:05 PM;I think I’m getting pretty close to the end of everyone’s “normal” path although I rode Kimmy down Rikku’s path;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:12 PM;Uhhhhh yes;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:12 PM;"Well, no missable items. Those were in the Via Purifico with Yuna as she was finding her team mates again";;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:12 PM;And with the Tidus/Wakka combo;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:13 PM;"Anywho, that stretch of hallway leading up to Seymour. Definitely grind there for about 30 minutes";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:35 PM;Why?;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:37 PM;"Because Mt. Gagazet (two areas after Bevelle) shows a stark jump in difficulty, enemy health and such";;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:37 PM;And the boss in that area is a real cunt;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:38 PM;"The AP provided by the enemies in that stretch of hallway is much better than anything you'll see for a while, and are easy to overkill";;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:38 PM;"You *can* grind on Mt. Gagazet of course, but the enemies are harder to beat, hurt more and offer less AP";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:38 PM;Hmm. Ok. I did some grinding there.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:39 PM;I wanted to get reflect for yuna because I was an asshole and read a strat for the boss.;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:39 PM;👍;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:42 PM;So now I’ll shit on the boss rather than struggle. Ugh.;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:43 PM;Are you upset at that for some reason? o.o;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:43 PM;Yeah. Haha.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 04:43 PM;I wanted to go totally blind.;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 04:46 PM;Oh. How'd you die?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 05:23 PM;I didn’t.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Nov-18 05:23 PM;I decided to see if it was a tough boss and ended up seeing the strat.;;
Rasea#1840;16-Nov-18 05:32 PM;Ah;;
rickmenso#2139;16-Nov-18 06:00 PM;i finally hit postgame on switch version of woff what content to start with;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Nov-18 06:48 PM;assuming you did all of the requests from that girl;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Nov-18 06:48 PM;you can do the 4 post game dungeons but they're pretty lame overall;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Nov-18 06:49 PM;you can unlock some xenogears mirage thing though;;
sovereign110#4690;16-Nov-18 09:28 PM;Anyone finding any of the champion jewels in Maxima useful?;;
rickmenso#2139;17-Nov-18 05:03 AM;There was one that gave Ultima 1ap;;
rickmenso#2139;17-Nov-18 05:04 AM;Was pretty useful early/midgame;;
rickmenso#2139;17-Nov-18 05:44 AM;after playing those new intervention quests it feels like sequel bait;;
rickmenso#2139;17-Nov-18 05:45 AM;the new characters to profile info its like they added it for sequel purposes;;
N7Savage78#7800;17-Nov-18 11:53 AM;Anyone know what the release date for the FFVII remaster is?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Nov-18 11:55 AM;"Hahahahaha, you're funny";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Nov-18 11:56 AM;"(Psst, there isn't one yet)";;
N7Savage78#7800;17-Nov-18 11:56 AM;Shit. I wasn't sure. I heard they were working on it so I was excited. Fuck;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Nov-18 12:03 PM;They still have a **looooong** way to go;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Nov-18 12:03 PM;Especially since it's Square Enix;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Nov-18 12:06 PM;Nope.;;
rickmenso#2139;17-Nov-18 12:58 PM;Remaster is out on ps4;;
rickmenso#2139;17-Nov-18 12:59 PM;Remake is in the works;;
Trap#7370;17-Nov-18 01:09 PM;hi;;
Trap#7370;17-Nov-18 01:09 PM;was wondering if someone wanted to run me through the comrade DLC for $50?;;
Leon#9542;17-Nov-18 01:23 PM;"I don't think anyone here plays or cares about Comrades, try discord.gg/ffxv";;
Trap#7370;17-Nov-18 01:33 PM;"cool, thank you";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Nov-18 01:48 PM;@Rasea#1840 I have a four hour flight coming up later today. About to handle natus Seymour. Anything I should know in the upcoming parts? I’ll probably play the entire flight.;;
Rasea#1840;17-Nov-18 02:05 PM;"Nope. Other than Yuna is great since he uses mult-element attacks in a fixed pattern so NulElement will make short work of him. Petrify will exist, so you'll want Softs. And Rikku, because Al Bhed Potions and her speed. Then there's Flare in the last phase of the fight which really hurts which is what Reflect is for";;
Rasea#1840;17-Nov-18 02:06 PM;Also don't put the same buff on all three characters;;
Rasea#1840;17-Nov-18 02:06 PM;As that triggers Desperado and removes all positive statuses;;
Rasea#1840;17-Nov-18 02:07 PM;"So for example, you can do something like:, , Shell, Shell, nothing, Nothing, Haste, Haste, Protect, nothing, Protect";;
Rasea#1840;17-Nov-18 02:07 PM;"As long as the same status doesn't exist on all three characters, it won't trigger";;
Rasea#1840;17-Nov-18 02:13 PM;"Oh, and he also casts Protect when he htis 24,000 HP. You can Dispel it, iirc. But the easier thing to do is come into the fight with Bahamut having a full Overdrive (or Yuna having Grand Summon). Summon Bahamut when he's about to hit 24,000 HP and use his Overdrive, bypassing the threshold that would cause Seymour to cast Protect on himself";;
Trickster#9840;17-Nov-18 02:30 PM;Earliest FF7R comes would be 2020 as a PS5 launch title;;
liamkinh101#4961;17-Nov-18 03:10 PM;noooooooooo;;

Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 12:47 PM;Is there any good discord server for woffm? Cuz im lookin for some tips about the game from experienced players;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:04 PM;Given how long Maxima has been out experienced players might be a bit too much to ask for.;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:04 PM;"If you're looking for answers to stuff for WoFF in general, I might be able to help";;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:12 PM;Well isnt it pretty much the same as the normal woff?;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:13 PM;"New content on top of the original, as I've understood it.";;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:15 PM;"Well first off, how do you get shiva, and whats with this black chocochick";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:16 PM;There are two versions of Shiva;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:16 PM;The unique one (it has a star next to her name iirc) is obtained at the end of the game;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:16 PM;Oooh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:16 PM;The other one is obtained from evolution of one of the ice mirages;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:17 PM;I thought it was something involving goinf back into an old dungeon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:18 PM;The star version is from the story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:18 PM;At the end of the game;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:19 PM;Same goes for Ifrit and Ramuh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:19 PM;Yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:19 PM;I will add that the star versions are all weaker than the evolution version;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:19 PM;What about the black chocochick? This thing was a pain to get but idk how to transfigure it into the next version;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:20 PM;"I believe the baby mirages for each line are Frit, Blizz, and Zap";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:20 PM;I dont remember for the chocobo;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:20 PM;Been some time since I played;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:20 PM;You need to obtain a certain item from one of the fights you can do at The Girl who forgot her name I believe.;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:22 PM;"And any clue when my next unlock is for champions? I just reached dragon scars and ive only got WOL, and reifa";;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:22 PM;"And the 2 that came with the game, sephi and balth";;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:22 PM;You'll get another two or three soon-ish.;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:22 PM;"Oh right, Balth is DLC";;

Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:25 PM;Oh i see what you're talking about Though;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:25 PM;Bablizz;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 01:26 PM;Yes;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:27 PM;So are there any requirements to evolve bablizz to shiva;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:28 PM;And how would i get the baby forms of the other 2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:29 PM;For Shiva I do think you need to do a sidequest for the 3rd evolution before shiva;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:29 PM;Not sure if there is anything else in between;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:31 PM;"Alright, and last 2 questions for now i think, what is tamas evolution and how to get it, and is cloud available as a character i can use or champion";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:32 PM;Tama is some fox thing you can only get it after the bad ending;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:32 PM;Story spoilers;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:32 PM;"Bad ending, hmmmm";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:33 PM;The endings can all be done in one playthrough btw;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:33 PM;Oh cool;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:33 PM;As for cloud he has a medal you can summon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:33 PM;I dont have Maxima so idk how to make him playable;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:34 PM;Idk if hes playable either;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:34 PM;Just wanted to see if he was;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:34 PM;I was under the impression that everyone who was a summon in the base game is playable but dont quote me on it;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:35 PM;"Oh wait actually 1 more, i remember i was checking the reddit n someone mentioned noctis when talking about this game";;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:36 PM;Any clue on how to get him?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:36 PM;"No, he was not in the original game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:36 PM;Probably a maxima exclusive character;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:36 PM;Ill try searching it up then;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:37 PM;👍;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:39 PM;Turns out you can go fishing witj noctis for a minigame;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:40 PM;Im guessing if you get enough points you unlock his medal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:41 PM;Ah ok;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:42 PM;Now the real question is where do i go to do this minigame 🤔;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:43 PM;In Besaid probably;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Nov-18 01:43 PM;Damn autocorrect;;

Trickster#9840;18-Nov-18 01:48 PM;Noctis fishing game is indeed in besaid;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 01:58 PM;Turns out cerberus is a pain to catch;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:03 PM;It really is;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:04 PM;This is the only cerberus encounter isnt it?;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:06 PM;@Malfred#1000;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:08 PM;Sorta;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:09 PM;You can tell catching this shit is annoying when ur using a champion to heal it so it doesnt die;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:09 PM;XL Cerberus you just get through the story.;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:09 PM;So i dont have to catch this one in dragon scars?;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:10 PM;Gimme a sec;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:10 PM;IT WORKED;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:10 PM;JESUS;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:11 PM;25K XP;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:11 PM;Enjoy it;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:11 PM;XL Mirages are a lot of fun;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:12 PM;Does the cerberus spawn back like the dragons if i leave the dungeon n come back;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:13 PM;Cuz if so i just found one sweet xp farm for now;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:17 PM;I don't think so;;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:18 PM;"I haven't tried, so I can't say";;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 02:18 PM;But I believe it is considered a boss encounter;;
Trickster#9840;18-Nov-18 02:18 PM;Yes he can respawn;;
Trickster#9840;18-Nov-18 02:19 PM;Any visible encounter on screen can respawn;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:19 PM;Im gonna go ahead n fight him a couple more times then;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:19 PM;The xp is amazing;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:50 PM;Oh shit champions are playable;;
Jerry Black#8814;18-Nov-18 02:50 PM;I didnt know about the jewels;;
rickmenso#2139;18-Nov-18 03:49 PM;not all of them;;
rickmenso#2139;18-Nov-18 03:49 PM;not the dlc ones;;
rickmenso#2139;18-Nov-18 03:49 PM;and the new ones are only jewels and no medal;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Nov-18 05:57 PM;@Rasea#1840 I found a wife and kid. Lost the husband. I can’t find him though. Is it there close by or is it a longer side quest of some sort?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Nov-18 05:57 PM;I just don’t want to waste time unless I can handle it somewhat quickly.;;
Rasea#1840;18-Nov-18 06:01 PM;"That's for the uhhh... celestial mirror sidequest, iirc. Which is related to the celestial weapons. If you want to find him, he's at that campsite in Macalania where the group stayed around that cinematic romantic scene with Tidus & Yuna";;
rickmenso#2139;18-Nov-18 06:21 PM;That was a good scene (and song);;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Nov-18 06:24 PM;Ah. Ok.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Nov-18 06:24 PM;Yeah that was a good scene.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Nov-18 06:27 PM;But I have a bit of a pit in my stomach because summoners aren’t supposed to make it so not sure if they’ll end up together.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;18-Nov-18 07:44 PM;I want to finish the game... but I’m worried I won’t like the ending.;;
Rasea#1840;18-Nov-18 07:46 PM;You actually will;;
Rasea#1840;18-Nov-18 07:46 PM;It's a great ending;;

Brion#4623;19-Nov-18 06:41 AM;"it wasn't fun, but it's nowhere near the level of lightning dodging";;
Brion#4623;19-Nov-18 06:42 AM;which is one of the most anti-fun things a video game has had;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Nov-18 06:42 AM;"Now, I have the exact opposite opinion";;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Nov-18 06:42 AM;Lightning dodging > Chocobo race;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Nov-18 06:44 AM;Lightning dodging is also terrible.;;
Brion#4623;19-Nov-18 06:45 AM;"if it didn't have the quirky way to easy mode it, i would consider it not even being a part of the game";;

Izwar Vain#5689;19-Nov-18 06:48 AM;"I mean, there is a spot where you would get a regular pattern of lightning strikes";;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Nov-18 06:49 AM;It's more of a test of endurance rather than skill;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;19-Nov-18 07:18 AM;"For the lighting dodge, try it with the sound off";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 09:19 AM;"If i remember, isnt it beneficial to lvl up and transfigure because they would be stronger than the transfigured form in the wild";;

sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:05 AM;"I'm wondering if the addition of champion jewels in Maxima makes the twins more viable in postgame, once you can remove them from stacks.  Most tips I've searched for online indicate almost always removing them at this point, but a lot of them are dated before Maxima was released";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:23 AM;"Well ive been playing the shit out of the game, and i think the champion jewels make the twins really good @sovereign110#4690";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:24 AM;Any of the jewels in particular?;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:25 AM;@Jerry Black#8814;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:25 AM;"Not particularly, each one gives them abilities that are good in diff spots";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:26 AM;"When it comes to all around use, maybe the celes jewel, it gives you a move that does alot of damage if ur low on hp";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:27 AM;"And when it comes to situations, like if ur in a water area, lightnings jewel can come in handy as her move i believe does thunder damage and comes with the enhanced thunder ability, n thats really good if shes stacked with other units that have thunder skills";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:28 AM;You also have to watch out though as their moves cost quite a bit of ap;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:29 AM;Usually 7 or 8 from what ive seen;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:30 AM;But thats about all the info i got for you rn;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:31 AM;Still playing through the game;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:31 AM;"Ah, yeah I noticed how expensive their skills are.  The only one I've found useful in particular right now is Shantatto in a magic stack";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:32 AM;Occasional free spells + strategic AP gain lets me spam basic-tier spells for a lot of damage and the reduced AP per turn is negated somewhat;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:32 AM;"Yeah, the celes one is only good in low hp situations sadly";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:32 AM;er. the magic stack I'm referring to has Magitek in it;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:32 AM;I think squall n cloud are pretty fun though;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:33 AM;So Battery Powered is the reduced AP I'm referring to;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:33 AM;Ah;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:33 AM;"Cloud seemed pretty good, a Strength++ jewel coupled with a fairly useful ability";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:33 AM;I didnt use magitek much but i can see its use;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:33 AM;"It's pretty good for grinding since you start each fight with max AP, but it can be annoying in longer, tougher fights since you're getting less per turn";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:34 AM;Shantatto helps make it more viable for those boss fights though;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:34 AM;Btw have you gotten noctis yet?;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:34 AM;Ik hes in besaid but idk where;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:34 AM;Nah the other minigames gave me PTSD so I've been avoiding the fishing one that just popped up;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:34 AM;Do i have to beat the game?;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:34 AM;"I only got the prompt after finishing the postscript, yeah";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:35 AM;"When it comes to water enemies, you could try a physical stack lightning with bravery";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:36 AM;I think she'd do alot of damage in a team like that;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 10:41 AM;"Yeah I can see it.  I'll try to fit them in my team when fighting enemies that have a specific weakness I know of, or if I'm trying to level grind (using Bahamut to wipe out higher-level enemies is pretty good for power-leveling mirages from lv.1)";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:41 AM;"When it comes to there being loads of enemies with one weakness like fire or something though, just go cerberus its too easy lol";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:49 AM;"Im just now at the crystal tower but i got it kind of lucky, alot of enemies are fire n ive had lanns stacks focus fire attacks";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 10:53 AM;Idk;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:04 AM;"Yeah, removing twins from the stacks means you can't use mega summons, and obviously if you're using the jewels to keep them competitive with other mirages, you can't use the medal summons either";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:05 AM;"So those drawbacks are obvious, I was just curious on a unit-to-unit comparison if people have been finding them useful compared to just replacing them with mirages";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:14 AM;"I have never replaced them, i usually use jewels to give them the sweet abilities till i have 3 stars for champ medals";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:14 AM;well you can't replace them at the point you're at even if you wanted to haha;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:17 AM;Wouldn't want to anyways;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:18 AM;"Once I got access to some decent L-size mirages and invested in them, I did find myself almost never using the stacks with the twins in their L-form";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:18 AM;Im really glad i got the black chocochick for 1 reason;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:18 AM;Fucking flee;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:20 AM;Also are champ jewels a new feature or were they in the original;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:20 AM;New feature;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:20 AM;Oh cool;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:22 AM;"That's one reason I was asking about all this, it seems obvious why you'd replace them without the jewels (mirages have good abilities while the twins can only get common spells and stat boosts via mirajewels originally)";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:22 AM;But with champ jewels they can get some more unique abilities themselves along with all the other stuff mirajewels help with;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:23 AM;Ye;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:25 AM;"Can be a tough decision concerning stats, too.  Like my Lv.66 Tonberry has much better overall stats than LV.72 Lann for example, even with Strength++/Agility++/Critical++ jewels equipped";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:26 AM;"But can the tonberry use slayer? No, so lann = better in my opinion";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:26 AM;"Haha, it can use Knife though, and Knife is fucking brutal";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:27 AM;"Crits for like 7000+ damage, yeesh";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:27 AM;But i dont see it pulling out a buster sword or gunblade;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:27 AM;"Gunblade is a stupid weapon anyway, but point taken about the buster";;

Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:28 AM;N i know he has quite an arsenal;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:28 AM;Or whichever button it was that you held down to auto-evade in that game.  Circle maybe;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:29 AM;I think it mightve been hold b or x for xbox controllers;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:29 AM;Yeah;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:29 AM;"I haven't delved into FF15 for more than a couple hours; I have a hard time with open-world games in general though";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:29 AM;"Thought Skyrim was boring as hell, I even had a hard time getting into TW3";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:29 AM;I think its really fun;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:30 AM;Like the game said it was a ff game for newcomers and old players;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:30 AM;"It was mostly for newcomers IIRC, haha";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:30 AM;I did new game+ on that game like 4 times;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:30 AM;"Old players could appreciate the references and things, of course, but it didn't really play much like almost any of the old games";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:31 AM;I still think its pretty cool and if it didnt play like older games then it did good on trying something new;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:33 AM;"I watched a friend play it for awhile one time, he was about halfway through the game I think.  He was lamenting the difficulty (or lack thereof) a lot";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:33 AM;He showed me a battle that was supposed to be tough for him at his level and he just potion-spammed his way to victory while also spamming warp strike;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:34 AM;"Hmm, i never really spammed warp strike";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:34 AM;Warp strike was somethinf you were supposed to combo i believe for good damage;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:34 AM;He mightve cheesed the fight by spamming warp strike with a really hard hitting weapon then;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:35 AM;"It's possible, he didn't go too in-depth and we spent most of the time bullshitting about other things haha";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:35 AM;That way he still dealt some damage even without the combo multiplier;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:35 AM;"But i wont lie, its definitely more for newcomers";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:36 AM;If you go on easy mode every time ur about to die u get to summon noctis's childhood friend carbuncle;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:36 AM;N they heal u back up;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:36 AM;Literally making it impossible to die;;

sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:37 AM;"Easy mode should tone down the difficulty, not eliminate it 😛";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:37 AM;"The only time i went on easy mode was the final boss cuz it was my first time playing, the boss was tough to me, and i was low on items";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:38 AM;You can also redo the playthrough with new game+ n get a pretty good item at the end;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:39 AM;After u beat the game u could fight a retarded high health and strong boss called adamantoise i think;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:39 AM;"I do plan on playing through it eventually, especially now since a ton of new stuff was added since I first got the game";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:39 AM;If u beat it u got an adamantoise bracelet or something that gave the wearer max hp;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:39 AM;"It is competing with Trails of Cold Steel for my next-play spot though, which is tough";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:40 AM;Btw the royal weapons are actually pretty fun to get;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:40 AM;Theres also special dungeons you can enter after the end of the game as a challenge n to get some of the best weapons in the game;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:41 AM;"I recall reading how the royal weapons are mostly useless due to their drawbacks, though one in particular did have some use (I forget which one)";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:42 AM;Theres one weapon that dealt more the less hp u had n i think some people abused the shit out of it;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:42 AM;You could deal crazy ass damage if u got to 1 hp n had ur limit broken;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 11:42 AM;"Yeah people always seem to abuse those SOS effects in FF games, haha";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:43 AM;Thats where the royal weapons come in handy;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:43 AM;I think one of them if not all used up ur hp when attacking;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:43 AM;"So ppl used that to get to 1 hp, then destroyed with the low hp sword";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:46 AM;After beating the game it got rlly easy to cheese xp;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:47 AM;"The original adamantoise fight took like over an hour, but i learned you can spam a ring that has a move with the chance to 1 hit kill";;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 11:48 AM;So you just spam it till adam dies;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 04:01 PM;"ok fellas, how do I unlock the Ultima group ability in WoFF?\";;

sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:30 PM;I've been trying to find damage formulae for this game for awhile;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:30 PM;I have no idea;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:30 PM;I could test it out if you give me a few minutes;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:30 PM;@Jerry Black#8814;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:33 PM;Cloud for sure;;

sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:35 PM;So there's your answer @Jerry Black#8814;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:35 PM;Makes sense since Cloud costs 2 stars heh;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 05:36 PM;Ight;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 05:36 PM;Thx fam;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 05:41 PM;Yup cloud did the trick n took out goldy boy;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 05:41 PM;All thats left is the knight;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:42 PM;IIRC the knight is much less of a nuisance;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 05:44 PM;She kept spamming the dust shit;;
Jerry Black#8814;19-Nov-18 05:44 PM;The slow was annoying;;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 05:54 PM;"Yeah, luckily at that point I was in the habit of keeping my team Haste'd so I would negate the Slow most of the time";;
sovereign110#4690;19-Nov-18 06:40 PM;"Hey what the hell, does the EXP Boost mirajem even do anything?  I'm still getting the same XP at the end of battle";;

Izwar Vain#5689;20-Nov-18 05:22 AM;I don't know anyone who plays FFBE here;;
MagicCosmic7#7491;20-Nov-18 05:26 AM;Oh its ok;;
MagicCosmic7#7491;20-Nov-18 05:26 AM;Thanks;;
☠Ocelot☠#9260;20-Nov-18 07:08 AM;I dabble in it sometimes;;
pokemongenius#1474;20-Nov-18 08:51 AM;I stopped long ago with the christmas event the amount of effort required to kill these overly spongy bosses made me stop caring. Plus their were secret quests you had to basically look up to find. In a non mobile game thats fine but when those kinds of quests are essential to allowing the player to progress and or gain more resources its very punishing to not be able to find those quests.;;
sovereign110#4690;20-Nov-18 04:54 PM;@Jerry Black#8814 I think the best XP spot before the postgame EX dungeons is that new area that opens up in Icicle Ridge where you find that Tama reskin mirage;;
iMadFusion#6592;21-Nov-18 03:47 AM;Just started playing ffxiv since i noticed it has free trial;;
Malfred#1000;21-Nov-18 03:50 AM;XIV is a good game;;
iMadFusion#6592;21-Nov-18 04:06 AM;Is it a lot different to wow because i used to play that a lot;;
iMadFusion#6592;21-Nov-18 04:23 AM;Is tonberry still unofficial aussie server;;
Malfred#1000;21-Nov-18 06:44 AM;"You can feel a bit of WoW inspiration in it, but it is very different for the most part";;
Malfred#1000;21-Nov-18 06:44 AM;"And I don't know.. I'm a filthy yurpean playing on the NA servers, so I know nothing about unofficial regional servers";;
Caius#6568;21-Nov-18 07:18 AM;I think it is yeah;;
Caius#6568;21-Nov-18 07:18 AM;But I'm a Brit on EU server so :GWfroggyJerry:;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;21-Nov-18 05:17 PM;So i'm playing through FF7 for the first time and i just wanna know is it possible to get Yuffie at a part after you go to the other continent;;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Nov-18 10:13 PM;You can get Yuffie as soon as you can reach the area where she can spawn;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;21-Nov-18 10:32 PM;what areas can she spawn at;;
Rasea#1840;21-Nov-18 10:37 PM;"Yuffie can be found within forests at a % chance as a random encounter. The earliest is the forests around Junon & Fort Condor. She can spawn in basically any forest at varying rates, though the ones around Rocket Town are nearly guaranteed to give you a Yuffie encounter";;

iMadFusion#6592;22-Nov-18 03:13 AM;is dragon quest 11 good;;
iMadFusion#6592;22-Nov-18 03:13 AM;ive never played dragon quest games;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:14 AM;"If you like classic JRPGs and turn-based combat, then yes";;
iMadFusion#6592;22-Nov-18 03:15 AM;good story?;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:15 AM;Serviceable;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:15 AM;It does its job;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Nov-18 03:18 AM;"Wait, DQ11 is turn-based?";;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:19 AM;Yes;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Nov-18 03:19 AM;Oh really. I just somehow assumed it evolved to real time combat like FF15;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:20 AM;Nah;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:20 AM;FF is the only JRPG franchise that tries to innovate with each new title;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:20 AM;DQ has stayed more or less the same with each entry;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Nov-18 03:22 AM;Is it like FF12?;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:24 AM;No;;
Rasea#1840;22-Nov-18 03:29 AM;"DQ11 is wonderful from a gameplay aspect. I love it. DQ takes a simplistic approach to its storytelling. Most RPGs have a lot of different things going on. DQ is pretty much evil bad villain exists, deal with them";;
Rasea#1840;22-Nov-18 03:30 AM;"DQ11 is turn-based, as Mycroft pointed out. When you get into a battle, you're put into a small ring with enemies. You can move around in said ring, but it does nothing at all. No idea why it exists. Probably to give some illusion of an ARPG I guess. Would explain people's occasional misconceptions";;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:42 AM;Nah;;
Malfred#1000;22-Nov-18 03:42 AM;It was to go with the photo-mode;;

Rasea#1840;22-Nov-18 12:03 PM;Ah well. They're not for everyone;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Nov-18 01:26 PM;DQ1 was my first DQ game.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;22-Nov-18 01:50 PM;9 for me;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Nov-18 03:23 PM;I like IX.;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Nov-18 05:10 PM;9 was my first as well I then regressed to 1+2 on GBC then 7 and 8 on 3DS;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Nov-18 05:34 PM;"I bought DQ 1 on my phone, I'm a big fan of old-school turn-based combat, but this was TOO way old";;

sovereign110#4690;23-Nov-18 03:36 AM;"oh wait, there it is";;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 04:31 AM;"@Izwar Vain#5689 If you want an old-school DQ, that isn't too old, play from DQIII and onwards";;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Nov-18 05:06 AM;Alright! I'll keep that in mind;;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 05:30 AM;"DQIII is more or less the grandfather of all modern DQ games, the one that really created the standard framework for the rest";;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 05:30 AM;Whereas DQI and II are closer to greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandfathers;;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 05:31 AM;"They have some similarities, a few minor things have carried over into the younger generations, but it is barely noticeable";;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 05:31 AM;"What is noticeable though, is their age";;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 05:57 AM;I am trying to find a good order to paly the games;;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 05:57 AM;But I can't decide which ones I should play in order;;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 05:57 AM;Can anyone help;;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Nov-18 06:04 AM;"Well, are you more into turn-based or real-time combat?";;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 06:04 AM;turn;;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 06:04 AM;I hate real time combat;;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 06:04 AM;I hate xv;;
Noz#9273;23-Nov-18 06:04 AM;But I like VII;;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 06:37 AM;Outside of the direct sequels (the -2s and LR) there is no set order you need to follow;;
Malfred#1000;23-Nov-18 06:39 AM;"If you're a fan of VII you'll likely prefer the games with ATB systems, so play III-VI, VIII, and IX then move on to X, XII, and XIII";;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Nov-18 07:47 AM;"FFs that are often recommended for first-plays are 4, 6, 7, sometimes 9 and 10";;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Nov-18 07:56 AM;I would maybe recommend 10 because it's the most turn-based out of those;;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Nov-18 09:42 AM;Interesting FF9 question. The back of the case makes mention the Crystal returning most likely referring to the old classic FF1 crystal shenanigans. Now my question then is what is it referring to outside the endgame area? I feel like there's more here I'm not seeing.;;
JanusKitsune#1056;24-Nov-18 09:48 AM;is 210 good?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:32 AM;Just got through the calm lands. I think I missed the chocobo side quest and at least one primer. Should I go back?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:33 AM;how far back do you think you missed it?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:33 AM;I just took a look at a guide. The chocobo and one primer are back by that tent place.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:34 AM;"ah then yeah, if you want might, as well pop back and get it";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:34 AM;"So... not too far back. Maybe a 15 min round trip, less the side quest part";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:35 AM;Hmm. Yeah. You’re probably right. I’d like to try the chocobo side quest.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:37 AM;"I may have also screwed up the celestial mirror thing. I found the mom and kid, then found the dad, then went back and found the kid. But when I found him, he didn’t ask about the mirror. He said something like “remember this place” and then his parents came and got him and they all left. Anyone know what I did wrong?";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:38 AM;you have to get the mirror in the calm lands;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:39 AM;"in the northern part of the calm lands(more north westerly, I think) there's this ramp leading a small way down the cliff";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:40 AM;but there's a guy blocking it;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:40 AM;sorry I've said so much and didn't even ask if you have the mirror;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:42 AM;you got to win a chocobo race and head for that area as he'll be distracted by you winning the race;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:42 AM;I forget whether this is actually to get the cloudy mirror now;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:42 AM;"oh wait, it's that chocobo race thing at remiem temple";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:42 AM;fuck I'm confused now;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:42 AM;it's one of those things;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:43 AM;Wait. I thought I get the mirror from natus Seymour;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:44 AM;okay so you got to do the remiem temple chocobo race thing to get the cloudy mirror;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:44 AM;Seymour doesn't drop jackshit;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:44 AM;Hmm ok.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:44 AM;I might leave that to my second playthrough.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:45 AM;Or at least later in the game;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:45 AM;yeah up to you;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:45 AM;I’ll do the chocobo race thing now though.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:45 AM;And grab that primer. Then back to the bridge;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:46 AM;yeah up to you;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:46 AM;looks like you just have to win the race to get the mirror;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:46 AM;So there’s the chocobo races... then the temple one?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:46 AM;Are they separate? Or are we talking about the same thing?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:46 AM;I’m confused now too. Hahaa;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:46 AM;calm lands have the ballon chocobo race thing;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:47 AM;remiem temple has a race where you got to get chests and dodge poles and stuff;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:47 AM;Ah. Ok. So two different things.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:48 AM;"yep, sorry for the confusion, It has been a very long time since I did these things";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:48 AM;Ha. No worries. I’m doing them for the first time. I don’t need to do everything but I’d like to check out the “important” side quests.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:49 AM;"if you want ultimate weapons, I'd suggest get one or two in your first playthrough";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:49 AM;"if you want to, that is";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:50 AM;Eh. If they’re easy.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:50 AM;"lulu's, tidus', wakka's and kimahri's are a bit cumbersome to get";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:50 AM;especially lulu's and tidus';;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:50 AM;Ha. I’ll probably pass then. Definitely do want to play through it again.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:51 AM;This game is just behind VI for me.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:51 AM;I’m liking it more than I thought I would.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:52 AM;This was my first FF;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:52 AM;So enough said;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:52 AM;My favorite battle system so far.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:53 AM;Sphere grid is cool.;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:53 AM;"but sphere grid is really nice, yes";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;24-Nov-18 11:54 AM;I’m about 75% through IV and I really like it as well. A very “true” FF game;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:54 AM;what platform?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;24-Nov-18 11:54 AM;I managed to get to the 75% mark in IV but hit a wall and never went back;;

Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:15 PM;"Hey guys, what does this mean? Is this something that concerns me?";https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/516421672312766465/unknown.png;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:20 PM;I'm not even sure what that would mean;;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:21 PM;I guess it means that FFXIV purchases through Steam are tied to the European Squeenix accounts for some reason. Which would be a seperate thing from the North American ones (I assume) you can buy on the official site with its own account sign up process and such;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:22 PM;Does that mean I need a European account?;;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:24 PM;"If you play it through Steam, I think so. If you wanted to do it on NA, I would assume you'd have to use their independent game launcher or whatever through the official site";;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:38 PM;So I asked on the XIV subreddit and got this reply as an automated response from the bot there;;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:38 PM;"```If you're asking whether Steam accounts and Windows accounts can be combined or swapped between, the answer is no. Steam and Windows FFXIV licenses are as different as PlayStation and Windows and require separate purchases. Unlike Windows and PlayStation though, you cannot own both and must pick between Windows or Steam. Once you own one license, you cannot ever own the other on the same Square Enix account.```";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:39 PM;yep;;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:40 PM;Go away you unhelpful person 🗡;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:41 PM;no u;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:42 PM;"So my question is, when I create an account, do I need to set it to a European country?";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:42 PM;"No, no matter which region account you have you can create a character on any datacenter";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:43 PM;You should still buy XIV on Square Enix;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:43 PM;Why?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:43 PM;Because if you get it on Steam you're locked into buying the expansion packs on Steam as well;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:43 PM;And you can only launch through steam;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:47 PM;Ahhh I see;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:47 PM;So that's what they meant when they said cannot own both;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:48 PM;It should go on sale pretty regularly on the Square Enix store;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:48 PM;That's how I got it;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:48 PM;"Even if I buy it now, I can install it whenever I want, right?";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:48 PM;yep;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:49 PM;It's pretty big;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:49 PM;Especially if you buy all the expansion packs;;
Rasea#1840;25-Nov-18 07:50 PM;`It's pretty big` ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°);;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:50 PM;Or... should I just buy it when the next expansion comes?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:51 PM;Because I know that I won't be touching it till mid-year next year;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:51 PM;You could do that tbh;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:51 PM;I'm not sure if they'd put the expansion on sale that soon after it comes out though;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:52 PM;"Yeah, but I figured SE might give extra bonuses especially to newcomers around that time";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Nov-18 07:52 PM;I wouldn't know lol;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 07:53 PM;Just a guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:30 PM;"Folks, I got a question, 6 or 7? I love the materia system and such, but 7 is on such a pedestal now. I like the 6 story, but I've never finished it. Opinions?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:31 PM;what are you asking?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 10:31 PM;"Uhhhhh, what's your question?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:31 PM;which one to play? which one is better?;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:31 PM;Do you like 6 or 7 better lol;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:32 PM;Just opinion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:32 PM;I like VI more;;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 10:32 PM;Same;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:33 PM;"Kefka is such a ludicrous and crazy villain I find, where Sephiroth is very typical anime villain archetype";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:33 PM;I like 7 more because of the materia system;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:34 PM;I like the final fantasies that have job systems of sorts.;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:35 PM;"Ah the job system, 5 is my favorite for that, just some jobs are so silly and situational.";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:35 PM;"Yup, job system is why 5 is my favorite.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 10:36 PM;Job system is why FFTA is my favourite;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:36 PM;materia isn't much of a job system if that's what you're implying tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:36 PM;"as for best one, V or Tactics";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:36 PM;"I know, but it gives some customization of abilities.";;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:38 PM;"Materia gives enough options that your toons are always prepared, jobs were slightly limiting. But I still loved them";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:38 PM;most of them have that I guess;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:38 PM;"9 doesn't really have customization, you get the abilities your class gets";;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:38 PM;Still one of my favorites though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:38 PM;you get it in passives;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:39 PM;Ah fair enough;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:39 PM;"Yeah, I do like 9 more than most of the other jobless ones.";;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:40 PM;"9 has my favorite characters, they're a diverse and silly bunch.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;25-Nov-18 10:41 PM;Vivi 😭;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:43 PM;"Vivi is amazing, he's so relatable lol";;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:47 PM;So what do people think of atb vs static or active combat? I was introduced with 10 so I love static first then atb.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:48 PM;I prefer static.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:48 PM;don't really care about the differences between the two tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:48 PM;tb or atb is fine;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:48 PM;The main difference for me is that I can get distracted without fudging up a battle.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:49 PM;that's really what sets them apart;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:49 PM;I prefer SMT's press turn mechanic though;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:50 PM;Smt?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:50 PM;Shin Megami Tensei;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:50 PM;^;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 10:50 PM;Haven't played it sorry 😅;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:51 PM;basically the amount of turns you get is affected by specific actions performed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:51 PM;simplest example is hitting weaknesses;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:51 PM;"only takes up 0.5 of a turn, the rest will be taken up by the next person to act";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:52 PM;so two characters split a single turn just from that;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;25-Nov-18 10:52 PM;"Oh yeah! I haven't played much SMT, but I vaguely remember that.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:52 PM;however if you deal an attack that is absorbed/nullified you lose a turn for each enemy it counted against;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:53 PM;so you could fuck up an entire cycle if you aren't careful;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Nov-18 10:54 PM;there's other stuff as well but that's the main point;;
DanielBoon#0261;25-Nov-18 11:07 PM;That's really wicked though;;
Inko-chan#1899;26-Nov-18 10:39 AM;Is this FFXIV with Stormblood included or is it just the Stormblood DLC;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/516654125262438400/SmartSelect_20181126-113642_Chrome.jpg;
Izwar Vain#5689;26-Nov-18 10:46 AM;That's just the DLC;;
Inko-chan#1899;26-Nov-18 10:47 AM;shitfucker;;
Inko-chan#1899;26-Nov-18 10:47 AM;well its cheap;;
Izwar Vain#5689;26-Nov-18 10:47 AM;"Only the DLCs are on sale, but not the base game";;
Inko-chan#1899;26-Nov-18 10:48 AM;the complete edition is $60:sakaguchi:;;
Inko-chan#1899;26-Nov-18 10:48 AM;aight thanks ig;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 02:57 PM;is there any news on chocobo everybuddy its suppose to come out in 2018 was announced in september and nothing since... Theres not a whole lot of 2018 left hope theres no delay 😦;;
Malfred#1000;26-Nov-18 03:21 PM;Winter 2018 includes January and February 2019;;
Malfred#1000;26-Nov-18 03:22 PM;So there's a bit more left than you might've first anticipated;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:26 PM;ah kk when i put into google it just said 2018 even then all we have is a announcement trailer right;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:26 PM;so 3 months seems not to long;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:26 PM;i mean if they where far enough in dev cycle to realse game within 6 monthsi d expect more info;;
Malfred#1000;26-Nov-18 03:27 PM;"Yes and no.. Since it is a remaster, they might not have anything new to show";;
Malfred#1000;26-Nov-18 03:28 PM;"Of course, it could also be that something has gone wrong in the dev process after the announcement was made";;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:39 PM;wait its a remaster i thoguht it was a sequel to the wii game?;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:39 PM;oh it is a remaster huh i missed that either way i havn't playedht efirst nad this game looks sick im stupidly excited for it;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:41 PM;reading online makes it seem like noone knows how remastery it is and how much new stuff makes sense i guess theres so little info out;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;26-Nov-18 03:41 PM;either way it looks cool;;
N7Savage78#7800;26-Nov-18 03:52 PM;Hey when do you unlock Vincent in opera omnia?;;
Malfred#1000;26-Nov-18 03:55 PM;Story Chapter 7;;
Malfred#1000;26-Nov-18 03:56 PM;I think he's last of the characters unlocked there;;
N7Savage78#7800;26-Nov-18 03:56 PM;Got it. I was confused by what it said on the wiki. It says 1:7 so I was unsure;;
Daren#2313;26-Nov-18 04:27 PM;@N7Savage78#7800 have you started playing recently?;;
N7Savage78#7800;26-Nov-18 04:28 PM;Um a month or so ago I think;;
Daren#2313;26-Nov-18 04:30 PM;"i hope you are having fun, right now is pretty crazy with all this awakenings and EXs and all that stuff :zoinks:";;
N7Savage78#7800;26-Nov-18 05:29 PM;"Yeah I got no clue what those are lol. Which crystal is Vincent, btw";;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Nov-18 07:21 PM;Yellow i think;;
pokemongenius#1474;26-Nov-18 07:21 PM;Im probably wrong;;
Malfred#1000;27-Nov-18 02:29 AM;Vincent is dark;;
Malfred#1000;27-Nov-18 02:29 AM;That should almost be obvious;;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:08 AM;"I've never played Kingdom Hearts, how good is it?";;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:09 AM;Thinking about buying 1 and 2 on ps4;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 03:10 AM;"The gameplay is pretty solid. , The plot can be hard to follow at times but it works enough to be enjoyable.";;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:13 AM;"Yeah  I heard the story gets really complicated, seems everyones heeps hyped for KH3. Ive heard people talk about KH so much though but the disney thing turned me off it";;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:13 AM;You reckon its worth buying the package in ps4 store for $70?;;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:15 AM;what is so hard about plot to follow?;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 03:20 AM;Woo more KH things;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 03:21 AM;"So the KH games are pretty much fantastic. The mainline ones, anyways. The ones on handheld systems and mobile are of... varying quality. Which is a good thing, as it let them experiment and sort of pick the good & bad apart and place what they wanted in KH3";;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 03:22 AM;"The plot being hard to follow is something of an overexaggerated concept. You can sum up the events of each game in a paragraph or two. The details can get a bit wonky, especially with one of the handheld games, but overall they're not hard to follow at all";;
Crosburn#1111;27-Nov-18 03:35 AM;"I think the big thing that confuses people is the number of terms you need to remember and how they interact. One game introduces X, another introduces Y, and then five games later they introduce how X and Y are important to explain how Z works. The end result is a lot of people don't understand or remember a ton of terms/mechanics because they were introduced over the course of 15+ years";;
Crosburn#1111;27-Nov-18 03:36 AM;Also a lot of people played the first game(s) when they were children and didn't revisit them once they were old enough to follow along;;
Crosburn#1111;27-Nov-18 03:38 AM;Then mix that all together with the games being spread across many systems. One of the most important games was a PSP exclusive for a long time;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 03:38 AM;"Yeah, that's fair";;
Crosburn#1111;27-Nov-18 03:38 AM;"So nowadays it should be easy to follow along. All of the games (except 3) are out, you're not a child (probably), and all the games are on PS4";;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 03:39 AM;"I personally don't run into that issue because I've been a fan since the first game and I also happened to revisit it. But even if I didn't, I'd remember most of the terms and the general layout of the plot well enough to go into KH3 just fine";;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:47 AM;So basically if I buy the package which inciudes the main games + spinoffs it will be easier to undertand;;
iMadFusion#6592;27-Nov-18 03:48 AM;what is the  main thing kingdom hearts is so praised for;;
Crosburn#1111;27-Nov-18 03:54 AM;"Fun combat, interesting story, and likeable characters are the top three things that I think most people praise it for";;
Crosburn#1111;27-Nov-18 03:56 AM;Also it's worth noting that Birth By Sleep and Dream Drop Distance are main games even though they're not numbered. Arguably they're the two most important games to play;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 04:46 AM;The main attraction tends to be being able to beat up Disney villains;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 04:46 AM;It's also incredibly well balanced with very well developed mechanics;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Nov-18 05:30 AM;"That's only true for KHI, II and Re:CoM";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Nov-18 05:30 AM;BBS and 3D are the least balanced action RPGs I've seen in my life;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Nov-18 05:31 AM;3D is a particularly egregious offender;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 05:49 AM;Yeah. I was referring to the mainline ones there;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 05:49 AM;BBS Proud Mode makes me want to castrate myself;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 05:50 AM;Or was it Critical? Can't recall;;
Rasea#1840;27-Nov-18 05:50 AM;They both suck anyways;;
Malfred#1000;27-Nov-18 05:53 AM;Critical;;
Caius#6568;27-Nov-18 06:14 AM;The only problem I see you having is that the first one can be a bit cringey if you're an adult. It's worth a play though.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Nov-18 06:59 AM;It's Critical;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Nov-18 06:59 AM;The way damage works in BBS makes Critical Level 1 *easier* than normal Critical;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:39 AM;Do you guys think a druid necromancer multyclass would ever make sense roleplay wise?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:39 AM;Those seem like pretty hard opesites right?;;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 08:40 AM;You can flavor text anything you want. Corrupted druid becomes a necromancer;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:40 AM;I guess;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:40 AM;Was thinking something like that as well;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:40 AM;Btw;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:41 AM;How exactly does the transmuation work;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:41 AM;If i transform a block of a stone bridge to wood;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:41 AM;Would that peice fall off or would it still be connected?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:42 AM;What are the general uses for that ability anyways. All the material seem to have similar strength;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 08:42 AM;It's not like it's much easier to break a wodden door than a stone one;;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 08:44 AM;Is that in a D&D style setting?;;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 08:45 AM;"If so, I would say the piece of bridge is still connected.";;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 08:46 AM;"You can use the different materials for different purposes. Transmute wood to stone, then stone shape. or Transmute stone to wood and burn/cut through it";;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 08:46 AM;I haven't used transmutation much;;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 09:27 AM;"Also if you changed a support piece of that bridge from stone to wood, it could/should cause it to collapse";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:00 PM;i've heard that too but i don't understand how that would happen;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:00 PM;wood is great as support;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:02 PM;wait lmao ops;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:02 PM;i though i was in the lfg discord;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:02 PM;thanks for the answers anyway lmao;;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 01:05 PM;haha no problem;;
Brion#4623;27-Nov-18 01:05 PM;"wood is fine as support, but if the bridge is stone, it would probably be too heavy for the wood";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:08 PM;hmmm i suppose;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:49 PM;now for an actual ff questino;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:49 PM;like i guess you can make her learn none scaling skills but she is shit at strength AND magic?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 01:50 PM;I think she's technically the party member who does the weapon augments.;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:50 PM;i mean;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:51 PM;"thats not something she does in battle, only something you get when you get her";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:51 PM;her grid is also crap at least in the expert grid;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:51 PM;she has a long way to go into some skills like haste and cheer;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 01:51 PM;I think her speed is one of the highest.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 01:52 PM;So I use her to get a couple extra actions in between enemy turns;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:54 PM;hmm;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:54 PM;"i think maybe teach her protect, shell, reflex and despell";;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:54 PM;anything else seems pointless;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:55 PM;maybe ok if she doesn't die too fast;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:58 PM;you think bio is worth getting?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 01:58 PM;my yuna already has drain and the lvl 2 blk spells;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Nov-18 02:17 PM;Rikku has Mix;;
Inko-chan#1899;27-Nov-18 02:22 PM;How far does the XIV free trial go in the story;;
Inko-chan#1899;27-Nov-18 02:22 PM;or does it cut off;;

DanielBoon#0261;27-Nov-18 03:23 PM;It's level 10 if I remember correctly;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:42 PM;isn't kimari also a blue poop;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:42 PM;"can't strength, can't magic";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:42 PM;That's how he ended up for me.;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:43 PM;he seems even more useless because of the 3 character battle system;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:43 PM;giant opretunity cost;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:43 PM;has no hp as well lmao;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:43 PM;and the worst overdrive?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:44 PM;"His is blue magic, so it's hit or miss.";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:47 PM;i find the leveling system to be pretty intresting;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:47 PM;Yeah.;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:48 PM;because the str/magic scaling is by orders of magnitude;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:48 PM;any kind of big mistake will just fuck you over big time;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:48 PM;if you're new and don't know what you're doing;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:48 PM;and also any kind of extra strength and magic blue spheres will increase your damage output SO MUCH;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:48 PM;not really a huge fan of it actually;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:49 PM;I like it.;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:49 PM;i feel like it';;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:49 PM;s a bit overtuned;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:49 PM;i also think the xp rate scaling is pretty wack;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:50 PM;one area will give 1k xp per encounter;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:50 PM;I'm on the standard sphere grid and it's treating me nicely.;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:50 PM;then 3 hours of gameplay later it's up to 4k;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:50 PM;standard basically prevents any kind of fuckups;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:50 PM;but also makes it impossible to doubble/tripple dip the extra spheres;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:50 PM;or to make both mages black and white;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:51 PM;i sent auron and kamari down wakas route too lol;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:51 PM;not sure that was a good idea but it's not too bad;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:52 PM;i've heard the standard sphere has more empty nodes so if you intend to do end game content that will be easier;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:52 PM;but i also heard that it's doable with expert so it's not that big of a deal;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:52 PM;and you can always just cheat the end game content with the samurai :whaaaaaaa:;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:53 PM;also about the standard grid it just has so many more locks that the regular one doesn't have;;
Izwar Vain#5689;27-Nov-18 05:53 PM;Samurai?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:53 PM;the eon;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:54 PM;like what other move can just delete any enemy?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:54 PM;in any game?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:54 PM;is there any other?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;27-Nov-18 05:56 PM;It works even against bosses?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:56 PM;Yeah;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:57 PM;"The hardest end game bosses, it will just erase them";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:57 PM;Not pussy ass deathtuch just instant win;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:57 PM;Only limitation is getting a move and having enough money;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:58 PM;Many players choose not to use it because it pretty much is just cheating but if you don't want to bother maxing everything it's a nice option to finish faster;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:59 PM;I just looked it up. Apparently it has a slight stipulation.;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:59 PM;What do you mean;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 05:59 PM;"If a boss isn't in it's final form yet, it just advances to the next form.";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:59 PM;Yeah that makes sense;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 05:59 PM;Pretty sure the dark eons ony have one form tho?;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:00 PM;So it should just kill them;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 06:00 PM;yeah;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;27-Nov-18 06:01 PM;the wiki only lists 3 bosses as having this.;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:01 PM;Ive played like 20 games or so and it's dreadful;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:02 PM;The first waka overdrive you get is a pretty insane buff though;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:02 PM;Like 12k damage at 36 str;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:02 PM;The way to get the most out of blitzball is first of all always restart if you lose;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:03 PM;And the best way to stall is to hide behind your goalkeeper;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:03 PM;The ai buggs out and usually can't get to you;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:03 PM;Then you just keep passing to farm xp;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:03 PM;And the enemy gets none;;
Izwar Vain#5689;27-Nov-18 06:03 PM;"Yeah, I do that passing thing lmao";;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:04 PM;Always have him as the middle front;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:05 PM;"And just tank every hit, Don't bother pasding";;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:05 PM;Only pass to farm;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:05 PM;Boring as shit but i win every time;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:05 PM;The steam hd version helps by having auto saves the original didn't;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:05 PM;If i don't get the ball in the first or second half;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:05 PM;I just restart;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:06 PM;Til i get it;;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:08 PM;Blitz has a lot of return spheres which are really strong;;
herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:09 PM;"At least on expert grid, at worst they're like 1 move, often a lot better";;

herrabanani#9920;27-Nov-18 06:09 PM;Often easier to get a high score earlier in the tournoments;;

DanielBoon#0261;28-Nov-18 10:40 PM;:sakaguchi:;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:57 AM;Was thinking of doing a pretty challenging run in ff;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:57 AM;Ffx;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:58 AM;The idea is that strength characters can't attack and yuna/lulu can't cast spells;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:58 AM;Not allowed to use summons unless i have to;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:58 AM;No mix;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:59 AM;Do you think it would be possible;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:59 AM;Kimari wouldn't be allowed to attack or cast scaling spells;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 06:59 AM;Riku could do both;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 07:01 AM;How are you gonna kill enemies;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 07:01 AM;if your strategy is to escape battles then ha;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 07:01 AM;hahaha;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 07:09 AM;I would use expert grid and make the mages train str and fighters learn magic;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 07:09 AM;And maybe use poison and death?;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 07:11 AM;I wonder if i should just have it be they can't train str/magic rather than they can't use it at all so that i can get teough the early battles;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 07:12 AM;I also think there are a lot of great none scaling abilities;;
River#4775;29-Nov-18 09:33 AM;there are some challenges for the FFX;;
River#4775;29-Nov-18 09:33 AM;no grid sphere;;
River#4775;29-Nov-18 09:33 AM;or only rikku challenge;;

herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 09:39 AM;apparently you can do it with no anything;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 09:39 AM;so my challange is probably very doable;;

herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 09:40 AM;what does that have to do with this;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 09:41 AM;is it somehow tied to stats?;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 09:48 AM;would allowing blitzball make a challange run too easy? hmmm;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 01:34 PM;I think I still can't beat Seymour Flux even during my normal playthrough... that's what I think;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 01:37 PM;i beat him;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 01:38 PM;pretty tough but i beat him by actually skilling rikku instead of letting her rot in her own path;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 01:38 PM;"teaching her shell, dispell and stuff really helped with the fight";;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 01:39 PM;and a 4k tank auron with shell tanked the big attack;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 02:01 PM;Hmm... I'm going to try again tonight;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 02:02 PM;I will probably be on here asking for turn-by-turn help if it gets really rough.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 02:06 PM;"and I don't know who you're referring to as the now blue hair guy ... but yes, even with Seymour Flux, it takes a frustratingly long time to get back to the fight and listen to the cut scene shit again.";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:04 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506, Have characters with the highest Agility stat in first so that once he does Lance of Atrophy you'll still get at least one turn before Mortiorchis follows with Full-Life. Thus, giving you a chance to remove the Zombie status (with a Holy Water, Remedy, or Dispel). Lulu cast Bio on Seymor to poison him, Tidus cast Hastega, then just attack. If you enter the battle with your aeons with overdrive, you can summon and use the overdrive attacks and do massive damage (you'll only get one attack in per aeon before Seymour banishes them).";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:04 PM;"Seymour will cast Reflect on himself after some time. Make sure you Dispel him once this happens since he will most likely Reflect Flare on his next turn. If you manage to remove his Reflect, the counterstrike fails and damage himself instead for 6,000+ HP. When he has about 24,000 HP left, summon Bahamut and unleash Mega Flare for the kill.";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:05 PM;"Cross Cleave can be quite powerful too so having Protect should help. You can summon an Aeon to save yourself from his Total Annihilation attack, just in case he lives long enough to do it.";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:07 PM;"Also important to note, if Yuna has her overdrive while the summons have them full too, you'll be able to use overdrive twice";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:07 PM;but save bahamut until the final part when you think he's almost dead;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:08 PM;I used Bahamut's mega flare at some point in the fight when Yuna's overdrive allowed me to do it. It was probably mid-fight;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:08 PM;Why am I saving Bahamut when I could just summon it at any point for the big hit?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:09 PM;Do I want protect or shell on my peeps?;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:09 PM;Protect;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:09 PM;I dont reccomend using shell since any good spells will be bounced off;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:09 PM;so if yuna uses Cure it'll bounce off to him;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:09 PM;"Shell is for magic... protect for physical attacks, yes?";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:10 PM;yep;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:10 PM;if it still doesnt work you need to grind a bit;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:10 PM;shell will bounce spells? I thougth only reflect did that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:10 PM;I've been pretty close to beating him a couple times;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:10 PM;🤔 🤔 oh shit you right;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:10 PM;I'm probably just overthnking it like I normally do;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:11 PM;yeah just dont freak out;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:11 PM;follow the tips i gave you;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 03:11 PM;shell works again the mega attack anhilation or something;;
herrabanani#9920;29-Nov-18 03:11 PM;he fires a lot of missles and it blocks them all;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:13 PM;One more thing;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:13 PM;Do you have the Avenger weapon?;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:13 PM;thats my always preferred weapon;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:14 PM;avenger?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:14 PM;is that the Tidus weapon with counterattack?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:14 PM;"if so, then yes";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 03:15 PM;"I have to cast protect on each char, yes? It's not like hastega or other spells where it's multi-target?";;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:40 PM;if you have protectga;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:40 PM;then all characters;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 03:40 PM;which saves turns;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 04:17 PM;"https://i.imgur.com/TrvVADz.png, https://i.imgur.com/c9EQOVk.png, From when I helped someone a while back";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:21 PM;"Ah, there's @Rasea#1840";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:21 PM;OK. I have been doing most of that... just not very efficiently;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:21 PM;or rather not in an efficient order;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:26 PM;"also, if I just bio Seymour and only attack his little bitch buddy, I can just chill and cheese?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:27 PM;because I have about 5 more tries on me before I just eat some cheese;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:28 PM;"Kind of. You can't attack either of them after Seymour is poisoned. Every time that Mort is killed, he siphons HP off of Seymour to revive himself. If killed enough, he'll put Seymour below the HP threshold into the other phases";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:28 PM;wait... so how does seymour get poisoned if i dont act?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:29 PM;or do i just skip my turns and/or heal?;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:29 PM;You have Lulu use Bio Fury to poison him. Then just buff & heal until he dies;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:29 PM;has to be her overdrive;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:29 PM;?;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 05:29 PM;yeah;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:29 PM;why's that?;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 05:30 PM;so you get extra damage;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:30 PM;"so it still works either way, yes?";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:30 PM;Because attacks that damage him can put him below the threshold. So you can't use Poisontouch/strike or Poison Fangs;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:30 PM;just shorter with the OD?;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:30 PM;You want him to remain in his first phase if you want to cheese him;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:31 PM;Im confused;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:31 PM;below what threshold?;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:31 PM;"Alternatively, if you want to actually cheese him, you can come into the fight with full Aeon overdrives + Yuna's Grand Summon and knock off most of his health that way";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:31 PM;"yeah, i've seen that too... that looks like a lot of work";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:31 PM;"The HP threshold. 70k -> 52k -> 35k. Phase 1, 2 and 3 respectively";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:32 PM;"It's actually super easy. Just do battle with your aeons. They'll take damage, probably die. Use save spheres to revive them";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:32 PM;Keep doing so until all your Aeons have full overdrive gauges. Then get Yuna's up;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:33 PM;she's hitting her overdrive during the fight as it is;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:34 PM;"Well, ideally you want to come into the fight with it so you can do about 20k~30k in damage and then unload all your overdrives on him. But it's doable without prepping with Grand Summon if that's what you want to do";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:35 PM;"Flux is perfectly doable without cheese, obviously. Just takes some practice. Could also be a matter of stats. How well are you surviving Total Annihilation?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:36 PM;I'm not;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:36 PM;but I also haven't been casting shell or protect during the fight really at all;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:37 PM;That's what has killed me literally every single time;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:37 PM;.... I think... .maybe one time I didn't heal efficiently and a cross-cleave wiped me. But that was towards the end of my tries so I was just getting frustrated;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 05:38 PM;you need to grind a little bit to raise health then;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:38 PM;I don't think that's the issue;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:39 PM;"my last point was only related to me getting tired of the fight and just attacking when I should have healed, buffed or whatever";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:39 PM;Ah. You should definitely do that then;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:39 PM;I have most of my sphere grid filled out (each character path that is);;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:40 PM;"auron has like 4100 HP, other chars have north of 3k for the most part... lulu being the exception";;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 05:40 PM;"Wow, already?";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:41 PM;"Oh yeah, that's plenty for the Flux fight";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:41 PM;"yeah, I dont flee battles and I've gotten lost a couple times";;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 05:41 PM;"Yeah, you seem pretty overleved";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:41 PM;"haha, that's what happens when I wander around aimlessly trying to figure shit out and getting increasingly pissed at random encounters";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:42 PM;I dicked around in the calm lands field for way too long;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:42 PM;and macalania woods;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:42 PM;and Mt. Gagazet... blatant luck I found my way out of there even though it wasn't that complex;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 05:43 PM;"well yeah, once again, try starting the fight with the highest agility stats so you have more time with the buffs";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:43 PM;word. I'm still at work but I'll try this evening;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:44 PM;... or rather Do or do not. There is no try.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:44 PM;I'll be optimistic;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 05:44 PM;"Wait, you were lost at Mt. Gagazet?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:44 PM;Haha. I was slightly to moderately intoxicated;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:45 PM;I kept going in circles;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 05:45 PM;I'm pretty sure it's just straightforward 😂;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:45 PM;shhhh;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 05:45 PM;"oh yeah, i got stuck on gagazet too";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:45 PM;I definitely pulled a 180 at some point and found myself back at the entrance;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:46 PM;I was on a plane and said out loud oh for fuck sake;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 05:46 PM;😂;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 05:46 PM;Okay you were definitely somewhat not in a normal state;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:46 PM;I honestly don't know how I used to fly without FF games and edibles.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:47 PM;"I fly across the country multiple times a month and I can pop and edible, throw an FF game on my vita, and the flight goes by in no time";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:54 PM;@Rasea#1840 so who is the team for Flux? I know there are times to swap a folks out here and there but is there an A-Team I can keep in there most of the time?;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:57 PM;"Tidus, Auron, Rikku. You bring in Yuna in Auron's place at the start to buff everyone up. Rikku can bestow Protect/Shell/Reflect with the Use command";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:58 PM;"So that Auron doesn't miss out on Haste (Tidus can do that one), Protect, Shell and Reflect";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:58 PM;"Oh, and Yuna is used to Dispel Flux's Reflect so that he can't bounce Flare off himself onto you";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:59 PM;"RIght, i knew about the dispel";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 05:59 PM;how does Rikku bestow said spells with the use command? I haven't used her for much more than Mug lately;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 05:59 PM;As I don't think you have Purifying Salts yet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:00 PM;I do not;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:01 PM;"Light Curtain, Lunar Curtain, Star Curtain";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:01 PM;I wonder if I have those things;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 06:06 PM;You probably should from all that unconscious grinding;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:06 PM;haha true;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:07 PM;but grinding is different from efficient grinding. I usually partake in the former;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:07 PM;so who knows;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:07 PM;although they sound familiar... so I'm hopeful;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:09 PM;"Yeah, Light & Lunar Curtains are typically picked up en masse at Thunder Plains";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:10 PM;"ah, ok.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:10 PM;I'm slightly anxious about this now... haha. The suspense is killing me;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:13 PM;Whereas Star Curtains are gotten from abusing Remiem Temple. Can't get them before Flux unless you do that;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:13 PM;"Which is, for the record, the reward for beating Shiva the 2nd+ time";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:19 PM;i wandered into remiem temple but didnt feel like doing it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:19 PM;there is a LOT to do in the calm lands;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:20 PM;Yep :P It's pretty much *the* postgame area for FFX;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:20 PM;Barring the postgame dungeon which is pretty neat;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:22 PM;oh and there's some arena there too;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:22 PM;which I'm *sure* you didnt know about 😉;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 06:23 PM;Definitely 👀;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 06:29 PM;Which one's Remiem again;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:52 PM;the one off the calm lands;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:52 PM;witht that chick in there;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:52 PM;belgimine or whatever;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;29-Nov-18 06:54 PM;and that al bhed primer I felt forced to chase down once I mistakenly saw it in the guide I was reading for Seymour Flux purposes;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 07:02 PM;I need to play the omega ruins and finish it:whaaaaaaa:;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 07:02 PM;wait but i cant:whaaaaaaa: :whaaaaaaa:;;
Inko-chan#1899;29-Nov-18 07:03 PM;My saves are gone :whaaaaaaa: :whaaaaaaa: :whaaaaaaa:;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 07:08 PM;Rekt 👀;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 09:47 PM;"Sad, Sad";;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 09:48 PM;Remiem Temple's post-game? I finished it before the final boss tho;;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 09:52 PM;"Uh, it technically is and isn't";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 09:53 PM;"It isn't because you can do most of the aeons, but it is because most people wait until after beating Sin to go back to it. But you can technically get all the aeons and fight them there before beating Sin";;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 10:05 PM;I usually consider post-game content as those which are considerably hard;;
Izwar Vain#5689;29-Nov-18 10:06 PM;"The Remiem temple wasn't that bad, but I guess some people might find it difficult";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 10:16 PM;"Well, it's defined as content being after the end of the game. Hence post";;
Rasea#1840;29-Nov-18 10:16 PM;Postgame can be easy;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 10:53 AM;"So once I beat the story, I can keep playing? Or do I need to load a save before final boss?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 10:53 AM;"Also, didn’t get a chance to play last night so still on Flux.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 10:54 AM;@Rasea#1840;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:16 AM;You load a save before the final boss;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:17 AM;Its best to do all the side content when you get the airship;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 11:17 AM;Is it one of the games where you can't leave the final dungeon after you enter?;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:18 AM;kinds sorta;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:19 AM;you can leave any area with the save sphere shit;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 11:54 AM;i dont really have the airship yet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 11:54 AM;i havent played a game of blitzball outside of the required part earlier in the game;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 11:55 AM;The airship should be soonish for you;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 11:56 AM;Blitzball was more fun before I was taught how to win.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 11:58 AM;i dont know how to win;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 11:58 AM;i need that stupid jecht shot;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 12:02 PM;You win with brother;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 12:04 PM;you definitely dont need it;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 12:04 PM;i beat the game without it;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 12:05 PM;"heck, i beat the game without ever using wakka";;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 12:05 PM;except for when i needed to;;
SPEARS#1176;30-Nov-18 12:32 PM;"what game should I pick up after FF10? I don't think I can enjoy pre 2000 sprite graphics anymore,  so going forward should I work my way to FFXV minus the MMOs?";;
SPEARS#1176;30-Nov-18 12:37 PM;"also, why is 12 $50 lol";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 12:37 PM;Because it’s an enjoyable experience. 🤷;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:01 PM;The sprite graphics are actually really cool in my opinion.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:21 PM;oh son of a bitch I tried Seymour during lunch and his total annihilation got me again... i was throwing up protect instead of shell.;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 01:22 PM;Try throwing both;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:23 PM;yeah i just thought i only had time to get one up at that point and i chose protect thinking total annihilation was a physical attack;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:23 PM;I was cruising until that... haha;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 01:25 PM;Correct me if im wrong but isnt there signs that total annihilation is coming?;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 01:26 PM;i think he gets a stance or something;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:27 PM;yeah yeah yeah...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:27 PM;i saw it coming sorta but used prtect instead of shell;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 01:28 PM;"well yeah, you gotta prepare yourself and time attacks correctly";;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 01:28 PM;happens to everyone lmao;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 01:30 PM;i dont want to sit through the cut scene again haha;;
Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 01:42 PM;"Yeah, Mort goes entering Auto-Attack mode, then next turn he'll go Ready to Annihilate and after that, Annihilate triggers";;
Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 01:43 PM;Phase 3 follows a very specific pattern so it's not hard to survive it as long as you keep shell up and yourself healed. And dispel Flux's reflect to avoid Flare;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 02:02 PM;yeah i had dispel going;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 02:02 PM;I just did protect instead of shell for that last phase.;;

Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 02:53 PM;Im proud that it only took one try to beat her tho;;

Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 02:54 PM;That's the worst part about failing to beat her tbh;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 02:55 PM;I don't remember rewatching the cutscene so I think I beat her first try.;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 02:56 PM;my best strategy was using up characters on zombie until they died and use a megapheonix;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 02:56 PM;it was a risky af strategy;;
Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 02:57 PM;That's... a strategy;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 02:57 PM;because it didnt waste turns healing and only took one turn to bring them back completely;;
Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 02:58 PM;"Yeah, but you could also get screwed easily";;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 02:58 PM;If it works it works;;
Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 02:58 PM;That it does;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 02:58 PM;All I remember about that battle was using a crap ton of Holy Water on Auron.;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 02:58 PM;"and like most bosses, i was sorta winging it";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 02:59 PM;Winging boss fights is really fun.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;30-Nov-18 02:59 PM;I used to do that in octopath until I found out how broken support classes are.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 09:59 PM;@Rasea#1840 just got to Yunalesca... I got to the third phase on my first try. Then I survived a megadeath blast... but she later used a second one and wiped the party because i didnt have anyone in zombie status;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Nov-18 10:13 PM;"Yeah, that's important";;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Nov-18 10:13 PM;Not really hard after you know the trick;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Nov-18 10:14 PM;Maybe just a lil irritating;;
Rasea#1840;30-Nov-18 10:14 PM;"Yep, pretty much. She's a status fiend that wipes you with a gimmick";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;30-Nov-18 10:50 PM;so whats the general strat?;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:21 PM;Don't die;;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:22 PM;"For her second form, she has 48000 HP. Dispel your Reflect and start attacking her. She will use Hellbiter, which will inflict Zombie on everyone, feel free to remove this status with Holy Water for now. But once she uses Hellbiter when she's dying, keep your Zombie status don't remove it. Her physical attacks are weak but Dispels all status enhancements. Spam Holy for 9999 damage if you have it.";;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:24 PM;"For her third and final form, which has 60000 HP, she will use Mega Death on her first turn so it will be game over if all your characters are not Zombies. She uses Mega Death through-out this battle, so keep at least 1 character zombie during this fight. Use your Overdriven Aeons to finish her off.";;
Inko-chan#1899;30-Nov-18 11:24 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;30-Nov-18 11:28 PM;for WOFF does joyride change anything like encounter rate? It makes you look chibi so are you forced to battle as lilken using it or can you still be a jiant? I don't rem using it much first playthough and googles not helping;;
52_bloodeyes#0947;30-Nov-18 11:29 PM;anyone know?;;
Rasea#1840;01-Dec-18 05:10 AM;"To expand on what Montblanc said, I'll type out a full thingy., , __First Form__, She uses a basic attack that removes **all** positive statuses except for Reflect (important note). She can use Absorb that deals 50% of the target's **maximum** HP, meaning characters can be killed easily. It always targets the highest HP character. If you attack her, you're hit with Blind. If you use magic attacks, you get hit with Silence. Anything else is Sleep., , **Strategy:** Simple enough. Go into the fight with Yuna, Rikku and Auron (or whatever other powerhouse you wish). Get up Reflect on everyone, do nothing until you achieve that. Afterwards, just attack normally. Rikku Al Bhed Potions + Alchemy means 2k HP healing which easily outdoes anything she can do to you, , __Second Form__, She opens this every time with Hellbiter, which inflicts Zombie on everyone and does around 600-1k damage. She will also use it immediately again if everyone is cured of Zombie, so don't do that. She will use Cura & Regen in order to damage Zombied characters. Also uses the previous attacks as well., , **Strategy:** You want to leave one character Zombied for the third form. At minimum, this unit needs to have Reflect on them. This will bounce back Cura & Regen. If your offense is pure physical, then you can Shell Yunalesca to halve the effects of Cura & Regen, also using Dispel on Regen. **Be sure to keep one character in Zombie otherwise the upcoming form shift will kill you.** A good way to do this is to cure everyone of Zombie, heal everyone, then deal the killing blow to force her into her third form. As curing everyone of Zombie, as mentioned, triggers Hellbiter.";;
Rasea#1840;01-Dec-18 05:15 AM;"__Third Form__, She opens this form with Mega Death, which is 100% accurate all the time and kills anyone that isn't Zombied. Failure to have at least one Zombied character means game over. She can also use Mind Blast, which is a high damage attack that also inflicts Sleep, Confusion and Curse. There is also a set pattern to her attacks here, which is nice., , Mega Death (opener), Hellbiter (if there's no Zombied characters), Curaga & Regen if there are, Third turn is same as above. Hellbiter/Curaga/Regen, Mind Blast (Sleep, Confusion, Curse), Hellbiter/Curaga/Regen, Mega Death. Loops from this, , **Strategy:** This is pretty much just a slug fest. Don't bother healing anyone at all. Keep a Zombied character or two alive at all times (preferably two). Shell Yunalesca, as you'll have Reflect on your characters to deal with the Blind/Silence/Sleep counters. Throw out lots of offense, reviving as needed.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Dec-18 12:48 PM;Yeah I know I’m pretty close to the end of the game.;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;01-Dec-18 12:56 PM;It's annoying but it adds a lot of difficulty and concentration to the fight;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;01-Dec-18 12:57 PM;especially since my party members are only lvl 50 and i dont have the ultima weapon;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Dec-18 01:55 PM;You should still be fine.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Dec-18 01:55 PM;I finished in the low 50s.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Dec-18 01:55 PM;Don’t think I had anything crazy on the equipment side. No post-game materia either;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Dec-18 05:52 PM;I know. You can’t be blamed for my ineptitude;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;01-Dec-18 06:06 PM;frick i died to Safer Sephiroth again;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;01-Dec-18 06:06 PM;I can't set up shields so its really hard;;
That Ωne ShyGuy#2549;02-Dec-18 12:14 AM;"So i heard that Safer Sephiroth has more health the higher level you are and i want to know if his other stats go up and if they do how much compared to his health, also I'm level 54 and about 51 for Barret and Tifa so should i grind for a short bit?";;
Rasea#1840;02-Dec-18 12:35 AM;"I can't recall what level I was for that fight, but the 50s sounds right. You should be good there";;
Rasea#1840;02-Dec-18 12:35 AM;"Additionally, his HP won't increase unless you have lv99 characters. So as long as you don't have any of those (and you don't), his HP & stats won't increase";;
Rasea#1840;02-Dec-18 12:36 AM;"Though if you used the Knights of the Round summon on Jenova Synthesis, then he gets an extra 80k HP";;
Rasea#1840;02-Dec-18 12:37 AM;"The best way to win that fight would be have someone with Enemy Skill put up Mighty Guard. White Wind also really, really helps there. Curaga as well, obviously. Regen is also nice";;

pokemongenius#1474;02-Dec-18 09:52 AM;You mean Corel? I believe you take the Tiny Bronco to the Temple of the Ancients if you got the Keystone from Dio from impressing him at Battle Square.;;
Brion#4623;02-Dec-18 09:57 AM;After the jail scene at gold saucer you continue to head west. Just follow the path as far as you can and the game will force you into the next story point;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Dec-18 01:16 PM;Yunalesca is a longer fight and having to sit through a LONG cut scene each time you give her a try was what was bothersome about this one.;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;02-Dec-18 07:58 PM;What kind of class is that;;
Leon#9542;02-Dec-18 07:59 PM;"Healer, I think";;
Caius#6568;02-Dec-18 08:00 PM;You are correct on both counts;;
Caius#6568;02-Dec-18 08:01 PM;It's the healer class brought in with Heavensward. You need to have access to Ishgard to pick up the job which starts at level 30.;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;02-Dec-18 08:01 PM;"At first glance, I thought it was a buff class";;
Caius#6568;02-Dec-18 08:02 PM;It kind of is;;
Caius#6568;02-Dec-18 08:04 PM;"The gimmick of the class is to draw cards that represent different constellations of stars, each one has a different buff effect. You can then sacrifice or hold cards to make the effect either more powerful for one person or apply to the entire party. For example the balance effect increases the amount of damage the person under the effect does by 10%";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 12:41 AM;"@Rasea#1840 OK, I'm now able to access the Sin location if I so choose. What should I do before I head to that area? Any side quests you really recommend? Also, I need to train up Yuna a bit so I can get her regen and curaga. Where's the best spot to do that now?";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:44 AM;Do the entire monster arena before going there >:3;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:45 AM;"But nah, uh";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:45 AM;After I got the airship I went straight to thunder plains to finally try to get that trophy. I suck at dodging.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:46 AM;I don't really recommend any sidequests or anything. You can abuse Belgemine in the temple for some reflect items to use with Use. FFX barely has any sidequests. What I do recommend is using the airship brush up on your Mix/Use items a bit. You can use my guide for that since it conveniently lists all of that;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:47 AM;I have a crest or two. I want all of these right?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:47 AM;"The notable items would be Poison Fangs, Sleep/Silence/Blind Bomb thingies (forget the name), Chocobo Feathers (pray at the stones in Thunder Plains and Cactuars appear for you to steal from them)";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:48 AM;"The crests are related to the large Celestial Weapon sidequest, which is basically only used for Monster Arena. If you don't intend to do Monster Arena, they're ignorable";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:48 AM;"As for Yuna, she's basically useless at Inside Sin. She's great against a boss there but only because of how predictable the attacks are and her ability to cast the NulElement spells";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:49 AM;"Your best characters at Inside Sin are, in order of usefulness:, Rikku, Auron, Tidus, Lulu, Waka";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:50 AM;What's so special about Monster Arena?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:51 AM;"It's **the** postgame content for FFX. You have the Omega Ruins, which is a postgame dungeon, but it's entirely doable right after doing the final dungeon";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:52 AM;So I should just continue the story and double back for this stuff after I reach the end?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:53 AM;"The Monster Arena is designed for all that postgame grindy goodness., , You can fight any monster you want there as long as you've captured it. You have to capture 10 of every monster for a slew of rewards which are invaluable for applying abilities to your gear as part of the setup to deal with the special creations that have assloads of health and damage., , You have to work your way through the Monster Arena in order to reach Penance and Nemesis, the penutimate postgame bosses. Working your way there requires the Celestial Weapons";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:53 AM;"Yeah, the only thing you don't want to miss are certain crests and stuff because they end up locked behind Dark Aeons";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:53 AM;Notably the one at Yunalesca and another at the Sanubia Desert;;

AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:55 AM;I figure If I need to I can grind up some cash and yojimbo them.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:55 AM;Let me check the ones that are locked behind the Dark Aeons if you missed them;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:55 AM;I don't have the game running.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 12:55 AM;Yojimbo?;;

AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 12:56 AM;Yojimbo is the summon that can 1 hit KO *anything* if he's bribed enough.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:56 AM;Yojimbo is an optional aeon you can get that theoretically can use an attack that hits all enemies for an instant kill attack that bypasses death immunity;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-18 12:57 AM;I find his can do zanmato more easily on the vita but this is just from my personal experience;;

Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:58 AM;You work your way through the dungeon and pay him about 200k gil and he joins you;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-18 12:59 AM;:GWqlabsKek:;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 12:59 AM;Tough dungeon?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 12:59 AM;It's pretty easy since you can do it at the time;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:00 AM;"It's an optional dungeon that you can choose to do right after dealing with that mech, so it's not hard. Just more like a you can go here for some loot and an aeon";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:00 AM;Should I get him and then blow all my Gil on the final boss?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:01 AM;"Well, it doesn't quite work like that. Yojimbo requires several hours and asstons of gil in order to manipulate hidden stats so that he'll use Zanmato when you want him to";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:01 AM;And you don't have the gil to front without access to the Omega Ruins;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:01 AM;Which is a postgame dungeon;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:01 AM;I don’t have 200k Gil though;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:02 AM;Oh. Well then.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:02 AM;And he's not a boss or anything. He's just sitting there and you can walk up to him and pay him around 200k to join you;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:02 AM;You can just wait until after Inside Sin to get him;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:02 AM;I only have like 120k;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:03 AM;"Well once I go do sin, it’s a straight shot to the end of the game, yeah?";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:04 AM;"Yeah. You use the airship to fight Sin, which is a series of boss battles., Afterwards, you get to go Inside Sin (heh), which is a lengthy-ish dungeon. You eventually get to a save sphere right before the final boss. Which is the save before the final boss thing that people have mentioned";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;Ok so I’ll have another chance at a save sphere to get in the airship again?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;Yep;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;Oh. Ok. Did not know that.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;FFX acts basically like FFXII does in that regard;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;I haven’t played 12;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;You save before the final boss encounter. Do final boss. Reload your save once it all is done;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:06 AM;"Ah, figured you had. Nevermind then";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-18 01:07 AM;they'll tell you when you've reached the point of no return iirc;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:07 AM;Yep;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:07 AM;Games usually do.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:07 AM;"Also, if you don't want to grind the ghosts, Ace, you can get x30 Purifying Salts from the Fallen Monks at Zanarkand to customize No Encounters";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:08 AM;Zanarkand dome is puppy guarded by a dark aeon.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:09 AM;Although it's been a while since I really played.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:09 AM;Oh. A new location randomly popped up in the list earlier. I want to say it was Mi’hen Ruins or something like that. What is it?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:09 AM;I wonder how many salts I have...;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:09 AM;"Just go to all the places, except omega ruins.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:09 AM;And what’s this omega ruins stuff? How do you get to that?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;Omega ruins will cronk you like nobudies business.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;There's a search command in the airship navigator.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;Basically you waggle the cursor around and spam the search button.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;Right. Saw that;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;New locations will get unlocked.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;By doing that exact method;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:10 AM;Is that how I got mihen ruins?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:11 AM;Maybe? 🤷 It's been a couple months.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:11 AM;I'm still on my first playthrough too.;;

Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:11 AM;^;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:13 AM;Wow. Awesome. So I should go to a couple of these and grab the weapons?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:14 AM;I'd recommend all of them except for Baaj Temple and Omega Ruins to grab the goodies;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:14 AM;Since they're free and it only takes a few minutes to get them all;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:14 AM;Yeah they look really good.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:14 AM;Baaj Temple has a dark aeon right?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:15 AM;"Baaj Temple has Geosgaeno, who can drop No Encounters armor. More importantly, it houses Anima";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:15 AM;I've been cronked by several dark aeons so I don't remember specifics.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:16 AM;"Yeah, they really screw you if you happen upon them by accident";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:16 AM;Thunder plains. kek.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:16 AM;Sanubia Desert. Mt. Gagazet. Besaid Island;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:17 AM;Besaid is easy to spot though.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:17 AM;The summoner dude blocks your path.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:17 AM;"Oh, and Mushroom Rock Road";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:17 AM;Any stuff in the sphere grid I need before finishing story?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:17 AM;Thunder plains I just be strolling and dark Ixion starts stalking me. :steinersurprise:;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:18 AM;"Not really. You'll mainly be using Tidus, Auron and Rikku for the final boss fight";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:18 AM;I turned Tidus in to a half white mage. 😄;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:19 AM;I don’t use Rikku all that much. Just to steal once in a while;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:19 AM;"If you like using Lulu, then it'll help to have her best spells";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:19 AM;Although she does know holy now;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:19 AM;I try to use everybody every battle so they're all pretty equal for me.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:19 AM;"You gotta use Rikku ;_; She has immensely useful mixes and is a powerhouse with Use";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:19 AM;I did for most of the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:20 AM;What do I use with her?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:20 AM;I hear mix is really good but I've never played with it.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:20 AM;My guide conveniently has a Mix shortcut table if you should choose to use it 👀;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:20 AM;It’s an overdrive though so it’s not a frequent tool.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:21 AM;"But uh, off the top of my head";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:21 AM;What’s her basic attack?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:21 AM;She’s a decent healer with the al Bhed potions.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:22 AM;But offensively I don’t see her use.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:23 AM;"My A-Team is Tidus, Auron, and Yuna.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:23 AM;"Petrify Grenade - works on 90% of enemies, instakills them, Sleeping Powder - puts enemies to sleep for a few turns, it's really useful on big tough enemies when paired with magic & poison (Lulu, or Poison Fang), Poison Fang - deals 2k damage and inflicts poison, Smoke Bomb - blinds enemies, Various elemental items (gems at this point) for elemental damage since her basic attack sucks for now";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:24 AM;Interesting;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:24 AM;"She also outclasses Yuna for most of the game because not only can she use Al Bhed Potions to team heal and remove ailments, she can double that healing with Alchemy (2k healing is wonderful)., , Yuna only ends up being better when Esuna is needed, or when you want to use her NulElement spells";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:24 AM;And dispel;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:25 AM;Shell. Protect.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:25 AM;Overdrives are also very consistent if you take the time to learn the modes. Slayer/Warrior is naturally learned for the physical offensive classes. Rikku's ends up getting Healer/Comrade;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:26 AM;Woah. Trio of 9999 looks gooood.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:26 AM;Well worth an overdrive.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:26 AM;Yeah I probably need to look at the Overdrive modes more.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:27 AM;This is one of the mixes.;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285480625820008448/519414311051853824/unknown.png;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:27 AM;"Stuff to mix it look kinda expensive though, so I guess that keeps it kosher.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:27 AM;What the shit is that?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:27 AM;"Actually, Rikku can use Dispel with Purifying Salts. You don't get those until Zanarkand though. And they deal 1,100 damage when used., , She can also apply Shell, Protect and Reflect with Light/Lunar/Star Curtains. She also has those Mixes that applies Shell and Protect to all party members at the same time. With a bonus of Haste/Regen/Auto-Life if you have the items for the better mixes";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:28 AM;"Actually, Trio of 9999 is abusable through Remiem Temple in the Calm Lands";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:28 AM;So you could mix that for the final boss and just cruise.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:29 AM;"If you do the chocobo challenge there, you can get Wings to Discovery x30. You can mix two together, which means 15 uses";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:29 AM;Plenty for every single boss after Remiem Temple;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:29 AM;I've never done any chocobo challenges.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:29 AM;I want to do this challenge.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:29 AM;What's a chocobo challenge?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:29 AM;You’re a chocobo challenge.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:30 AM;😔;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:30 AM;"(Unsure, sounds rough)";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:30 AM;It's just what I call it. You can do a chocobo race in this area where you have to go and open chests and then beat your opponent to the finish line;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:30 AM;Is that what the complete chocobo trophy is for? Racing? I never got the trophy.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:31 AM;"No, that one is different. That's the annoying one for Tidus's celestial weapon";;

Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:32 AM;"Yeah, that trophy is given for the annoying chocobo race with the balloons";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:33 AM;"The one in Remiem Temple has you running down paths and getting chests, then getting to the finish line before your opponent does";;

AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:33 AM;Are they both the balloon one?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:34 AM;Yeah;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:34 AM;Yeah;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:34 AM;ookay.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:34 AM;Chocobo License just involves passing the ezpz training exercises;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:34 AM;Chocobo Rider involves completing that annoying balloon race crap to get Tidus's sigil for his celestial weapon;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:34 AM;Both are unrelated to Remiem Temple's chocobo race;;

AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:35 AM;This looks like the right one.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:35 AM;Cool.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:35 AM;Yep;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:36 AM;"That one is difficult, but it just takes some practice and is much easier than the balloon one";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:36 AM;Doable in about... 15-20 minutes;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:36 AM;Depending on how quickly you improve;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:36 AM;Okey Dokey.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:36 AM;I think I know what I'll do while procrastinating tomorrow!;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:37 AM;Oh wow. Those prizes for the chests in the chocobo maze are pretty dope;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:37 AM;Mhmm;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:37 AM;Game breaking if you will.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:38 AM;"I avoid Trio of 9999 because it makes any challenge non-existent. But I love the Three Stars one. To turn Lulu into a consistent party member, mainly";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:38 AM;One MP cost? Gtfo;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:38 AM;Yep :p;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:38 AM;For Yuna too.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:39 AM;How hard is it to get all five chests?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:39 AM;Yeah. You get 60 of them so you can do One MP Cost for three characters or two characters and your aeons;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:40 AM;"Uh, it's a bit difficult. The challenge involves following these sort of winding paths. You have to figure out which chests are the quickest to get and then beat your opponent to the finish line";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:40 AM;But it's doable in about 20 minutes or less once you figure things out;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:40 AM;Well shit.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:40 AM;Apparently there's maps to follow out there.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:41 AM;20 mins once you figure it out? Why so long?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:41 AM;Is the race 20 mins?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:41 AM;You are racing.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:41 AM;You need to beat the opponent which can be tricky I guess.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:41 AM;I just meant total. Figuring out the paths and learning which chests are the ones to go for. And then actually getting all five and winning;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:41 AM;"No, you’re racing.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:42 AM;The race only takes about 30 seconds;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:42 AM;Got it.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:42 AM;But it's trial & error figuring out the paths & proper chests;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:42 AM;Or perhaps google?;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;I found a map. :sakaguchi:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;"Yeah, I'd rather just Google 😂";;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;That works too :P;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;"I just wanted to see what was in the chests, but the map was literally right next to the list.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;"I mean, figuring it out yourself does give a better feeling after you've solved it";;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;"But nahh, I'll pass";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;I have a 5.5 hour flight tomorrow. I’ll need something to do.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:43 AM;The proper chests are made to be pretty evident from my experience;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:44 AM;It seems that way from the map I found.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:46 AM;Ok. I’m gonna do that. Then grab the equipment from those optional spots. Then maybe some blitzball before I finish the game.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:46 AM;👍;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:47 AM;Can I play blitz all before the final boss?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:47 AM;Yeah. Everything in the game is made doable before the final boss. The final boss is just for cinematic/story purposes;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:48 AM;Like at that last save sphere?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 01:48 AM;Mhmm. Right after it you get into a sequence of events that you don't get anything from in which you fight the final boss;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:49 AM;Ok I’ll wait til then to play blitzball;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:49 AM;Ok.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:49 AM;Blitzball is pretty alright.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:49 AM;I just want to try it. I’ve only played the one game you play early in the story.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:50 AM;Did you get the Jecht shot from the cutscene?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:50 AM;No;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:51 AM;You want the Jecht shot if you're gonna blitzball. It helps a lot.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:51 AM;"```If it is not performed correctly the first time, the player can return to the Kilika Port and ride the boat to Luca. The ball will be in the same spot and this time, there are infinite possible tries.```";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:52 AM;That’s what I hear. I didn’t really know what was going on at the time. Totally failed the mini game and moved on without knowing what I’d missed.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:52 AM;Interesting... I did not know I could still get it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:52 AM;So I guess just take the airship there;;
Omar068#1138;04-Dec-18 01:53 AM;When will the final fantasy 8 let's play start.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:54 AM;"The jecht shot ignores 2 blockers, so it's really useful for scoring. The main issue is that it's a 15 second animation and eats up clock so don't try to use it for clutch goals too much.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:54 AM;Interesting;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:55 AM;Maybe I’ll grab that too.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:55 AM;Its a simple enough minigame.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:55 AM;All these little side things are popping up now. Haha.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:55 AM;That's the joy of airship fast travel.;;
Omar068#1138;04-Dec-18 01:56 AM;Is there a let's play made by this discord?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:56 AM;Go check the subreddit;;
Omar068#1138;04-Dec-18 01:57 AM;Okay thanks.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:57 AM;Details are on there I believe.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 01:57 AM;does #reddit-feed just have all the subreddit posts?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 01:57 AM;I guess so;;

AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 05:46 PM;I haven't had time to try it out yet. I've been busy with homework.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:46 PM;I spent more than half the flight trying to beat that cunt;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:47 PM;I beat him 3 times and the only pole I hit was the last one he basically checks you into down the home stretch.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 05:47 PM;"But that was 3rd on the itinerary, so you at least did other stuff too right?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:47 PM;Yeah. Other stuff was handled very quickly.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:47 PM;I’d say I spent two hours on that race.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:48 PM;Getting 3 chests and winning is easy. That took me two tries.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 05:48 PM;Was it 5 that was hard?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:48 PM;"Getting 5 chests, no poles, and winning is rough.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:48 PM;Yeah.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:49 PM;Beating it with 5 chests and hitting all the poles you want isn’t even that hard.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:50 PM;Making the tight cuts around the poles hurts your time.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:51 PM;I would either hit one or take the turn too wide so as not to hit the pole;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:51 PM;I had to put my vita back in my bag because I was getting so frustrated.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:52 PM;But I got the jecht shot. Got the hidden area equipment. Did some decent grinding in the calm lands.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:52 PM;At least I can trio 9999 shit for the rest of the game.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 05:53 PM;Did you try out the jecht shot in a blitzball game at all?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:53 PM;Not yet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:53 PM;I need to beat this chocobo thing first.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:53 PM;I might try it on my PS4 tomorrow to see if that’s easier.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:54 PM;Controlling the chocobo on a vita was not easy either.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Dec-18 05:54 PM;I still have one more flight to go but not sure if I can deal with any more of that tonight.;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;04-Dec-18 05:55 PM;Blitzball might provide an okay alternative if you still want to do something.;;

Rasea#1840;04-Dec-18 06:45 PM;"It does take some practice, and learning the precise movements around the poles so you don't hit them, but it's definitely doable";;

Inko-chan#1899;04-Dec-18 07:07 PM;where do i go in ffvii after getting out of rocket town;;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 07:12 PM;"The game is not very specific about where you should be going at this point. The suggestion is that you should head to the Temple of the Ancients which you don’t yet know how to find. However, if you do travel to the Temple you will find out that you actually require the Keystone in order to gain entry.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 07:12 PM;"So where do you find the Keystone?, , The Keystone can be found in the Battle Square area of Gold Saucer. The only way to have found this out within the game is to have traveled to a small house located on the right side of the western continent. A picture is included to show where it can be found on the map.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 05:51 PM;What’s a good customization for a tidus weapon? Just strength?;;

Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 05:56 PM;"Uh, the only options would be, Strength+ or Alchemy (if Tidus has Use)";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 05:56 PM;"A lot of customize options unfortunately involve large amounts of various items, or aren't useful on a melee attacker for the most part";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 05:58 PM;First Strike could be useful as well to ensure you don't end up getting screwed. Which can also be carried into Omega Ruins if you plan to touch that at all;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 06:18 PM;Interesting. I’ll throw that on there.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 06:18 PM;And rikku never attacks so don’t know what to put on her either.;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 06:48 PM;The only thing she needs is Alchemy;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 06:52 PM;Also do I get to basically spam holy for the rest of the game?;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 06:53 PM;"Oh yeah, couple of tidbits., You want to get a small stock of sleep/dream powders & silence grenades for Inside Sin because those enemies fucking hurt and are no joke to deal with. A few Poison Fangs isn't a bad idea either if you don't want to bring in Lulu every time for a specific encounter";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 06:55 PM;"And if you used those Three Stars on Yuna and she gets Holy, yeah. Holy's really powerful so feel free";;

Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 07:07 PM;Careful of the Behemoth King in there btw. You'll probably die to it unless you have Auron defending at the end or make a character flee before killing it. It casts a very painful Meteor spell upon death unless you kill it with a counterattack or capture it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 07:07 PM;Capture it?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 07:07 PM;For the arena?;;

GonzoArmstrong#4735;09-Dec-18 07:09 PM;Any FFX-2 Tips here;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 07:21 PM;"Uh, guess so? Your only two casters are Yuna & Lulu. So might as well do something with the last 20";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 07:23 PM;"As for FFX-2 tips, it's pretty straightforward in most cases, Gonzo. The only noteworthy things are gaining AP. You only gain AP through actions that don't involve using Attack, so abilities or other commands, even item, get you AP. You can spend long amounts of time in a single battle gaining AP if you have a way to cycle things so that the enemy never dies but you never do either";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 07:23 PM;"Other than that, more specific things like garment grids and dressphere locations can be looked up in a guide";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 07:25 PM;Well rikku can cast holy as well. Should still do some decent damage.;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 07:31 PM;👍;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:32 PM;What about all these spheres. They say they unlock an ally’s ability. Do I get to choose which one?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:33 PM;@Rasea#1840;;
Izwar Vain#5689;09-Dec-18 08:44 PM;Probably;;
Izwar Vain#5689;09-Dec-18 08:44 PM;"You can just test and try one, and then reload the game";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:46 PM;What's the sphere?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:52 PM;White magic for example;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:53 PM;"Decided to look them up. The ones that it could be are:, , Friend Sphere - Teleport to an ally's current location. (Does what it says, teleports a character to the current node of another character), , Skill Sphere - Activates a Skill node that an ally has already activated. (This means anything under the Skill category. Skills such as Quick Hit, Sleep Attack/Buster, the various Break skills), , Special Sphere - Activates a Special node that an ally has already activated. (Same thing as Skill Sphere, but for Special commands. These are, well, special commands that are under the Special category. Stuff like Steal, Use, Cheer, etc)";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:53 PM;"The White Magic & Black Magic spheres are straightforward; activates white magic & black magic nodes for a character that have been activated by another character";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:53 PM;Does a list pull up and I can choose the spell?;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:54 PM;"When you use it, it only lets you select the nodes in question that it's applicable for";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:54 PM;Like fucking A let’s have Lulu learn holy too and blast the shit out of everything;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:54 PM;That works :P;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:55 PM;"If you grind hard enough, everyone can basically learn everything?";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:55 PM;"What I originally did was since you get those Black Magic nodes before Inside Sin (I think around Bevelle), I used them on Yuna at the time so I could use her for something that wasn't healing/Dispel/NulElement";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:56 PM;"Yeah. That's the progression in FFX. Originally everyone has their own thing (except Kimahri, being the blue mage) and sticks to that. You then create versatility by going to someone else's path afterwards, eventually ending up having everyone able to use all skills, magic and specials";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:56 PM;I see now how the expert sphere grid could get really fun.;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:56 PM;"Which then turns into FF7, where everyone is defined by their limit breaks (overdrives in this case)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:57 PM;Right;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:57 PM;"Except for Lulu being a physical attacker. While funny, and I have seen people turn Lulu into Auron, her 6 second attack animation gets old fast";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 08:58 PM;Haha I bet;;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 08:58 PM;"And yeah, people use the expert sphere grid to basically turn everyone into Kimahri. Or, at least, have the option to";;
Rasea#1840;09-Dec-18 09:02 PM;A common thing there is turning Rikku into a magic caster either through Yuna's path (supportive) or Lulu's path (offensive) so that she's not relegated to Steal & Use for 85% of the game;;
GonzoArmstrong#4735;09-Dec-18 10:24 PM;using the normal grids is more fun imo;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;09-Dec-18 10:24 PM;I need to give her some magic spheres to up that stat;;
GonzoArmstrong#4735;09-Dec-18 10:25 PM;that way they have their defined role;;
Desert Stream~#1192;10-Dec-18 06:28 AM;how long is FFX-2 compared to X;;
Izwar Vain#5689;10-Dec-18 06:29 AM;Probably about 10 times longer mentally;;
Rasea#1840;10-Dec-18 06:29 AM;Lmfao;;
Rasea#1840;10-Dec-18 06:29 AM;FFX-2 is considerably shorter than FFX;;
Malfred#1000;10-Dec-18 08:18 AM;It really depends;;
Malfred#1000;10-Dec-18 08:19 AM;"Story-wise they're about equal, maybe 5 hours or so difference. X-2 being the shorter one";;
Malfred#1000;10-Dec-18 08:19 AM;Completion-wise X beats X-2 by a wide margin.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Dec-18 08:20 AM;Both have a significant amount of optional content though;;
Rasea#1840;10-Dec-18 08:21 AM;"I disagree, personally. I'd wager that X-2 is 10-15 hours shorter on story since you can just bumrush so much of it, whereas X has non-skippable cutscenes (and plenty of them), slower battles (but still fast for turn based RPGs) and a lot of areas you have to trudge through";;
Malfred#1000;10-Dec-18 08:21 AM;"True, you can bullrush through X-2";;
Malfred#1000;10-Dec-18 08:22 AM;"If I were to consider that, then yes.. You can dramatically reduce the length of X-2";;
Rasea#1840;10-Dec-18 08:22 AM;"I also really hate X-2 optional content. Not because it exists within X-2, but because of how it's designed";;
Rasea#1840;10-Dec-18 08:22 AM;"The second half of the cups involve abusing invincibility through Alchemist and creatures, and Via Purifico is chock full of bullshit";;

If you missed Mog or picked the wrong choice when you could've gotten him, then replace Mog with Edgar., , Locke's job is to steal and then use Hi Potions afterwards to keep everyone healed., Terra and Relm should be spamming Thundara, healing when necessary., Mog should be spamming Water Rondo (if you got it). Otherwise, his normal dance., Edgar should be using Drill., , Missle Bay should be your first priority, then Laser Gun, then Air Force., Whenever Air Force summons Speck, take it out ASAP with attacks that aren't Lightning or Water (it has inherent Runic to protect itself if attacks its vulnerable to are used), otherwise you'll eat a very painful Wave Cannon";;
Izwar Vain#5689;11-Dec-18 05:37 AM;Rasea is the true expert damn;;
Izwar Vain#5689;11-Dec-18 05:38 AM;I don't remember all this;;
Rasea#1840;11-Dec-18 05:38 AM;👀;;
Izwar Vain#5689;11-Dec-18 05:38 AM;Doesn't Edgar also have chainsaw;;
Rasea#1840;11-Dec-18 05:41 AM;"Yeah, but the Drill has 192 power. Chainsaw has 252 power, but the caveat is that 25% of the time it'll use an instant kill attack that checks for death immunity, which means 25% of the time he'll do no damage";;
Rasea#1840;11-Dec-18 05:41 AM;And that's if you pick it up at Jidoor by solving the puzzle there;;
Izwar Vain#5689;11-Dec-18 05:42 AM;Aren't the normal air force enemies vulnerable to instant kill?;;
Rasea#1840;11-Dec-18 05:50 AM;"Nope. All three enemies (Missle Bay, Laser Gun, Air Force) have death immunity";;
Izwar Vain#5689;11-Dec-18 07:52 AM;Ahhh really;;

Inko-chan#1899;11-Dec-18 06:45 PM;Who should I appoint to be my healer;;
Inko-chan#1899;11-Dec-18 06:45 PM;and my magic attacker;;
Inko-chan#1899;11-Dec-18 06:45 PM;Cant be the same people tho;;
Inko-chan#1899;11-Dec-18 06:45 PM;I'm thinking splitting the attack materia between Red XIII and Yuffie;;
Inko-chan#1899;11-Dec-18 06:45 PM;and leave the healing to Cid;;
Rasea#1840;11-Dec-18 06:47 PM;"Thanks :p On the guide bit. As for Rikku, that depends., , Assuming she near the end/only at the end of her own path, then she still won't attack for much. So she'll be relegated to Use, Steal and Mix. Steal happens often given that most things have useful steals. As for Use, Petrify grenades wreck most things. Sleep Powders put to sleep the big Iron Giant things. Silence takes care of those fungus caster thingies and the Monoliths that counter with Pharaoh's Curse when attacked normally. Blinding grenades for anything that's weak to that status. Also Poison Fangs on the Iron Giants after being slept to deal lots of damage., , Now, this is where things diverge based on the path you took her down. If she went down Auron's path for HP & STR, then she can use Breaks and will start doing more damage. If she went down Tidus's, then she'll have access to Cheer (super useful) and shouldn't take long to get Haste/Hastega., , In any case, she can still Attack if not using Steal or Use, as her damage is lower than other, but not awful in most cases";;
Inko-chan#1899;11-Dec-18 06:48 PM;can someone help me:GWfroggySadCat:;;
Rasea#1840;11-Dec-18 06:57 PM;"Sorry :p Uh, it doesn't matter because materia. That being said, Cid & Yuffie are your best melee attackers when taking into account your limit breaks";;

None of them are missable except for Water Rondo, due to no water areas existing in WoR. Have to go to Lete River/Serpent Trench for it., -If you're using Gau, get as many rages as possible. He sucks in WoR, but you may be using him., -Strago has some useful lores you can pick up., -A bunch of items become either unobtainable or very hard to acquire afterwards. This is negligible unless you consider items as part of your 100%. None of them are particularly good or useful at that point in the game.";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;15-Dec-18 10:55 PM;"@JCash1313#9500 As you probably know, the areas of Chapters 1-10 can't be revisited.

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;15-Dec-18 11:00 PM;"In Chapter 11, you'll be able to find various Elemental Charms (i.e. Ice Charm). If you dismantle one, you'll obtain a base level 1 Elemental Defense ring of the same element from it (i.e. Frost Ring : 20% Ice Resistance). Elemental Charms are really poor accessories, so dismantling them is not a loss. Moreover, the accessory they all can be upgraded into can be obtained another way (25% from the target of Mission 64). Edit : some Charms exist in double, so it should be easier to upgrade at least one than to hope for a drop.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:12 PM;"because it assumes that they had it for the other games, when there are several ways to port a game";;
Emiruko#0314;16-Dec-18 05:15 PM;"Since it is pretty much the only one they won't port, I'm assuming *something* went wrong @!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:16 PM;yeah I'm not saying that there isn't any problems but I just don't understand why people default to that one;;
Izwar Vain#5689;16-Dec-18 05:17 PM;Because we all wanna see SE burn;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:17 PM;"setting the technical details aside, even if they did have the source it isn't like they could just flip a switch and now the game is magically ported";;
Emiruko#0314;16-Dec-18 05:17 PM;"Yeah, just lost source code is a plausible theory, it happens often enough. Could be a few things really";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:19 PM;"I guess, it's one of those things where people who generally don't understand how these things work just fall back on";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;16-Dec-18 05:19 PM;"I feel they couldn't just *lose* the source code, because decompiling is a thing.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:20 PM;"well decompiling doesn't give you any sensible code back, especially from the PSX era";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;16-Dec-18 05:20 PM;But wasn't it on pc?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:20 PM;this is where C was standardized so most of what you get back is optimized or modified by the compiler;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:21 PM;"being ported to PC doesn't matter much, other than the assembly code will be generated for a different arch";;
Emiruko#0314;16-Dec-18 05:22 PM;"It is the easy theory to fall back on, I'm not sure what happened, so when I mention it, I always add the qualifier or something haha";;
Emiruko#0314;16-Dec-18 05:22 PM;"I just think that it's some sort of issue, and not them straight up ignoring it";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;16-Dec-18 05:23 PM;"If a decompiler produces obfuscated code, how hard would it be to clean it up?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:23 PM;very hard;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:23 PM;reverse engineering is difficult;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:24 PM;even decompiling assembly code you wrote can be a bit of a challenge;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:24 PM;let alone something that a compiler for an intermediate language generated;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:25 PM;"by itself, reverse engineering is an entire field of study and the difficulty is mostly dependent on how well you know the hardware";;
Emiruko#0314;16-Dec-18 05:25 PM;Sounds about right;;

AceTofuDelivery#1284;16-Dec-18 05:28 PM;My school uses assembly as a bottleneck class to weed out the weaklings. :trolltabata:;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Dec-18 05:28 PM;what you learn is good but you don't need it unless you're trying to do something that involves hardware or really low level systems;;

galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 01:40 AM;Since right after they tell you I decided to go to sleep and my brain decided to forget the name;;

galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 01:48 AM;Yeah I'm doing the huge materia section I just didn't want to spoil stuff;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 01:48 AM;I just got the Corel one;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 01:52 AM;Do I need to complete the mini game to get that huge materia if so well I guess it's time for money grinding;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 01:54 AM;Oh wait it tells you the location when you go to the deck of the highwind;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 01:56 AM;"There's only one forced Fort Condor battle, which is the last one for the huge materia";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 01:57 AM;"Which you do not want to lose, or you lose that huge materia";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 01:58 AM;Oh so when they say that shinra is on the offensive that means it triggers the battle for the huge materia?;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:03 AM;I think so?;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:04 AM;That fight is hard to lose anyways;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:04 AM;OK I was asking since I don't have that much money left since I splurged on weapons not to long ago and need to grind money and didn't want to do the wrong one;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:04 AM;"You basically just need to lose the Fort Condor battle (don't place any units, let them reach the top), then you're forced into a fight against CMD Grand Horn, which is a pathetic ass fight";;

galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:05 AM;"Oh so if you lose the fight you just fight them yourself, cool";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:06 AM;The only one I've done is the first one which I won with overwhelming numbers;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:06 AM;Not a big fan of the mini game though;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:06 AM;"Yeah, but the Fort Condor minigame is weird as a whole";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:06 AM;I do somewhat like the motorcycle one and the snowboarding one is kinda meh;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:08 AM;Basically the way it works is that there are battles that show up at Fort Condor at set intervals. It's one of the most missable minigames in the FF series because you have no idea when these battles take place without a guide and a few of the battles occur at really stupid moments;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:09 AM;"Like there's a point where you have to travel halfway across the fucking continent or something away from Fort Condor. Then you do a tiny event and watch a cutscene., Travel aaaaaaaaaall the way back to Fort Condor. Do that battle. Go back. Get another cutscene/event., Travel back aaaaaaaagain, do it, come back., , Most aren't like that, but it can be really stupid and super missable";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:10 AM;"As for the actual battles, those are weird too. You're meant to win every battle with units doing the minigame thing, rather than just brute forcing against the CMD Grand Horn when enemy units reach the top";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:10 AM;As winning the minigame battle means you get every prize possible;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:10 AM;"There's also... six battles that you cannot fight and must surrender 3,000 gil per battle, so you need to give them at least 18,000 gil if you want to do all the Fort Condor battles";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:11 AM;Also I asked this before but I don't think it was answered but do you need to catch a chocobo to breed them or can you just buy them;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:12 AM;"You can't buy them, you have to use the materia Chocobo Lure and encounter them in random battles. Feed them Greens (Mimett because cheap) and you get them that way";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:13 AM;I hope they're worth it since catching them is annoying if I remember correctly;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:15 AM;"Uhhhh, depends on how much you value the materia";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:16 AM;The whole sidequest takes 2-3 hours to do;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:16 AM;The rewards for doing so are:;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:18 AM;"Mime materia - required to beat Ruby Weapon, a postgame boss., HP/MP Swap materia - basically useless, Quadra Magic materia - lets you quadracast a linked spell or summon, super powerful materia, Knights of the Round summon materia - the strongest summon in the game and decimates literally everything, also has an animation that takes for-fucking-ever";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:18 AM;And the ultimate chocobo also defies all known laws of physics which is honestly a reward in itself;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:18 AM;"Oh, and the better chocobos can also be used for chocobo racing for some sweet prizes";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:19 AM;"The quadra magic sounds pretty OP if I understand it correctly, does it use the mp of 4 casts or no?";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:22 AM;Nope. It only uses the MP cost for the first cast;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:22 AM;Damn;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:22 AM;It's four casts of the linked spells/summon at 50% power each. So x2 effectiveness on any spell;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:22 AM;"Which doesn't sound as OP as x4 effectiveness, but you have to take into account multi-hit summons and spells like Comet that let you bypass damage limits";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:23 AM;If it can be paired with ultima it sounds like it can wreck stuff since from what I've heard ultima is pretty powerful already;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:24 AM;"Yeah, it's the strongest spell in the game";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:25 AM;"6.5x non-elemental damage to all enemy units, no split damage";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:25 AM;Man the materia system really lets you be OP if you want to;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:26 AM;Like I just heard about mega all;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:27 AM;"Yeah, Mega All is great";;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:27 AM;"What annoys me, though, is that all the powerful stuff is in the last 10% of the game so it's mostly pointless by that time";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:28 AM;If you could get multiple you could make it where every one in your party attacks every enemy;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:29 AM;"Yeah. That would've been amazing much earlier, but it's kinda meh at that point";;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:29 AM;That's why I think ff7 could've benefited from a NG+;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:29 AM;Ikr?;;
Rasea#1840;20-Dec-18 02:29 AM;That would've been *great*;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:30 AM;I hope someone mods a NG+ into the PC version if that's at all possible;;
galaxy87654321#2182;20-Dec-18 02:31 AM;Also it's doubtful but it would be cool if they release a ff7 ultimate or whatever alongside the remake that keeps the game the same but adds NG+ and maybe upgraded textures;;
Inko-chan#1899;20-Dec-18 06:48 AM;You could mod the game so it looks like an HD remaster :WutFace:;;

Izwar Vain#5689;20-Dec-18 06:49 AM;Woah dude;;
Izwar Vain#5689;20-Dec-18 06:49 AM;That actually looks sick;;
Izwar Vain#5689;20-Dec-18 06:49 AM;As in good sick;;
Inko-chan#1899;20-Dec-18 06:50 AM;square couldve atleast done this for the Steam/PS4 version :wakka:;;
SaintFrog#2754;20-Dec-18 09:23 AM;Pretty sure you can use the HD pack with the Steam version;;
SaintFrog#2754;20-Dec-18 09:23 AM;I've never tried it though;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;20-Dec-18 11:23 PM;anyone here play FFT regularly want to suggest a challenge run for a beginner to challenge runs?  I want to play again but do something different this time and I'm not sure what would be fun to do instead of just over-leveling early and playing the exact same way I always do;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;20-Dec-18 11:24 PM;"How about, don't change jobs";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;20-Dec-18 11:26 PM;so nothing but Squires and Chemists?;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;20-Dec-18 11:26 PM;or do you mean pick a job and stick with it for each character?;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;20-Dec-18 11:27 PM;"Well, picking a job and sticking with it for each character is technically switching jobs";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;20-Dec-18 11:27 PM;Cause you'd have to level those jobs to get the job you want;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;20-Dec-18 11:28 PM;"Try the more restrictive way first, then if it seems to hard move on to a slightly less restricted challenge.";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;20-Dec-18 11:29 PM;Tbh I'd just have one mediator so you can invite some enemies of your preferred job;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;20-Dec-18 11:30 PM;"I can try that, sounds interesting";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;20-Dec-18 11:30 PM;thanks;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;20-Dec-18 11:31 PM;No problem;;

pokemongenius#1474;21-Dec-18 08:34 AM;Probably not;;
DanielBoon#0261;21-Dec-18 03:20 PM;"Question, has anyone played ff1 with only white mages? Curious what it was like";;

Izwar Vain#5689;21-Dec-18 05:32 PM;Why would a sane person think about doing such a thing;;
pokemongenius#1474;21-Dec-18 09:14 PM;Its not to bad at first since you can power level at the Chaos Shrine although after that...;;
Devola#8099;21-Dec-18 10:22 PM;"I imagine you can play with all whitemages, but it would be slow";;
Devola#8099;21-Dec-18 10:24 PM;Chaos will have enough time to heal before you kill him;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 10:39 PM;I did all white mages back when Nintendo power first issued the challenge;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 10:39 PM;and yes;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 10:39 PM;it's very slow;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 10:40 PM;but not that difficult;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 10:42 PM;astos is probably the most difficult fight because RUB;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 10:52 PM;it gets a little easier later on when you get access to mid-level black magic;;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 11:18 PM;"Let's make a hypothetical assumption that all FF games are set in the same universe. If that were the case, which one would you canonically say is the true Final Fantasy?";;
DrCidd#2442;21-Dec-18 11:18 PM;I'm gonna say the first one.;;
Rasea#1840;21-Dec-18 11:44 PM;"I don't really have an answer for that but I would like to point out that you're using `canon` incorrectly. Canon means it's official and follows the lore of a universe and is considered to be real. A good comparison would be Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT. The first two are official as they are made by the original creator, but GT wasn't and is effectively glorified fanfiction. So it's not canon";;
Rasea#1840;21-Dec-18 11:44 PM;"If all the FF games are set in the same universe, made by Square/Squeenix, then they would all be considered canon";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 12:01 AM;what is this question even asking?;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 12:04 AM;I don't actually know. I guess the true/original FF that deserves to represent the universe as a whole?;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 12:04 AM;"The one that embodies the series the best, I guess";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 12:05 AM;yeah none of that makes any sense lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 12:06 AM;"forget I guess, I just realized he asked almost an hour ago so it doesn't matter";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 12:06 AM;"Which, I mean, doesn't make much sense considering even garbage stuff can be canon";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 12:06 AM;Ah well;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 01:06 AM;"Plus, picking which one would be the one that embodies FF the best wouldn't really be viable as SE likes to innovate the FF series so much";;
Realiti#0426;22-Dec-18 04:49 AM;"does combat on ff13 gets better, I've been playing it for 8 hours i love the story and characters but combat is just too handholding, all I do is press x and shift";;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 04:56 AM;It gets somewhat better if you stop using auto-battle.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:00 AM;"Or rather, if you don't constantly rely on it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:00 AM;There are times you'll want to use it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:01 AM;"I have no idea how far you go in that game in 8 hours in a first playthrough, but I assume you've reached Chapter 3 ?";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:02 AM;"You mentioned shifting, so yeah";;
Realiti#0426;22-Dec-18 05:03 AM;im in chapter 4 where you get odin;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:03 AM;tfw I miss a single word because it's on its own line;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:04 AM;"Anyway, here are a few tips to elevate your combat";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:05 AM;"Vary your paradigms : it takes very little time, and the right paradigm deck is the most important thing to defeat enemies efficiently";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:05 AM;"Areas are set up so that you discover enemies by themselves first, and then mixed with other enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:06 AM;"You can use that to learn how the enemies work, and take guesses at the flow of the fight in front of you, which will allow you to set the right deck up";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:08 AM;"Unless you feel like a boss is right around the corner, don't hesitate to use Techniques";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:08 AM;Getting 4-5 stars on fights will replenish the TP at a good pace;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:09 AM;Don't hesitate to equip a Doctor's Code and use Potions instead of using a MED;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:09 AM;It's much faster in early game;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:15 AM;"Also something people are either ignorant of or biased against is that FF doesn't really have varied combat. It just doesn't. Granted, in previous installments, you had enemies be weak to various elements. Or you'd need to deal with certain dangerous enemies (big or small) by inflicting certain status ailments on them. But even then, it wasn't very deep or varied";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;"It just feels worse in FF13 because you can't play aroud with anything (lack of classes and all that, despite each character having specific roles) and there's an assload of combat";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;I disagree;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;You can play around with it a lot;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;You can effectively treat it like FF1's enhanced encounter rate;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;But you're not required to do so;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;And you're not rewarded for doing so;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;That's the real issue;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:16 AM;"Also, the tutorials are borderline garbage";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;That's probably a better way to put it tbh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;And that's putting it nicely;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;No FF game has the optimal strategies from one encounter to the other be as varied as FF13;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;None get even close;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;But using poor strategies is not punished;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;Or rarely;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:17 AM;"And using good ones, barely rewarded";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;I like that you're punished for overleveling. That's a really fun mechanic;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;🙄;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;You're not really punished;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;You just can't do it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;That's... not the same thing;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;"No, I mean like";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:18 AM;The star rating. It takes into account your gear and your level based on your performance. I didn't actually know this playing through FF13 until my second playthrough. Where I grinded on the turtle... things before Bart's final fight with Orphan and shit;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:19 AM;It doesn't take your gear into account;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:19 AM;Only the final stats;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:19 AM;"In my first playthrough, I went in blind and was average level/gear. Got five stars no problem. On my second playthrough, I had a much harder time five starring the Orphan fight due to my grinding";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:19 AM;"Yeah, that's because you were using subpar strategies for the stats you had";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;There are... very few fights which are ACTUALLY really hard to get 5 stars on BECAUSE of overleveling;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;The first that comes to mind is the first mission of Titan's Trials;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;"Because that shit doesn't care about your stats, but the rating does";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;Difficulty is subjective and all that :P I'm sure I was still being suboptimal;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;Well;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;But it does count against you regardless;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;Very rarely;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:20 AM;I'll reformulate tho;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:21 AM;very few fights which are ACTUALLY really hard to get 5 stars on BECAUSE of overleveling *even with optimal strategies*;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:21 AM;The example I mentioned is actually impossible to 5-star with maxed characters;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:21 AM;Unless you preempt it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:21 AM;"And FF13-2 does the opposite, by the way, and it's way worse imo";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:22 AM;"The rating in 13-2 doesn't take anything into account, it's completely fixed";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:22 AM;You're punished for being underleveled;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:22 AM;I forget what Titan's Trials is 🤔;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:22 AM;And can't do anything about that;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:22 AM;The series of Missions that forms some sort of progressive tree;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:24 AM;Ohhhhh that thing;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:24 AM;I hated that place;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:29 AM;"And yeah, found the mechanics guide that explains the star rating., Five stars is a score of 13,000+., Target time is [(enemy strength) / (party member strength)] + 8, , Enemy strength is [(HP at the start of battle) x (enemy level)] / 16, Party member strength is [(attack power x ATB level) / (3.5 + ATB level)], Attack power is the highest number between physical and magical attack. That value is added up for all members to determine party strength., , So your gear does factor into it. If you gain more ATB levels through weapons, that'll affect your target time. And overleveling does affect your target time, making it harder to gain a five star rating on fights in general., , I just assume the idea is that with better gear & stats, you should be able to kill things much faster. Which is usually true. And also assumes the player knows the optimal ways to take down enemies";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:31 AM;I'm aware of the formula :sakaguchi:;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:31 AM;:sakaguchi:;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:31 AM;Optimal strats aren't necessary;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:31 AM;Even decent-to-good ones will usually give 5 stars;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:32 AM;And getting a preemptive strike makes it even easier;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:32 AM;"But yeah, took me a couple of tries on Orphan to get five stars on my overleveled playthrough";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:32 AM;Because it multiplies you battle score by 1.2;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:32 AM;"Let me load up a save, and try Orphan 2 with a fully maxed party";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:32 AM;I'm curious;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:33 AM;"Also I don't see how that makes things bad in FF13-2? Most games punish you for being underleveled because, well, you're underleveled. You're working with lower stats and gear and options";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:33 AM;Which is part of the appeal for people that enjoy the challenge;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:33 AM;But it has nothing to do with the challenge;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:33 AM;You're literally denied rewards in spite of the fact you're playing better;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:33 AM;Or regardless of the fact you're playing better;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:34 AM;Because they didn't bother to make a formula this time around;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:34 AM;"I can imagine it's a lot of work to get one working, but still";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:34 AM;"Oh, you mean in that way";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 05:34 AM;That sounds stupid;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:34 AM;"In FF13, you're not evaluated on how leveled your characters are";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:35 AM;But on how well you do with how your characters are;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:35 AM;"If you're underleveled, fights are harder, but a lot of different winning strategies will grant you 5 stars";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:35 AM;"if you're overleveled, fights are easier, but you'll need more specific strategies for 5-stars";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:35 AM;"Namely, using your full offensive potential";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:35 AM;Instead of playing as defensively as a half-as-leveled party;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:36 AM;You catch the drift ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:36 AM;To highlight how stupid it is in 13-2;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:36 AM;You literally *CAN'T* do an entire playthrough of 5-stars only;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:36 AM;Because the VERY FIRST FIGHT is impossible to 5-star;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;22-Dec-18 05:37 AM;"They're the most basic of basic ass enemies, tho :trolltabata:";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 08:51 AM;"Thanks for the lesson amelia, but I understand what 'canon' is, and I meant it as in true 'final' fantasy, as in chronologically speaking. I think it's safe to say dissidia is NOT canon. nor is ergheiz or World of FF";;

Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 08:55 AM;"Oh, that's fair then. Yeah, they're considered spinoffs and all that business";;

DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:06 AM;Which game comes last chronologically?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:13 AM;I'm not sure how to even begin to think about that question. Hmmm;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 09:14 AM;None of them;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:16 AM;"Yeah, my answer would be that the question is unanswerable. However, I have not played every main FF so I don't have much knowledge";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:18 AM;I'm not looking for a definitive answer here;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:18 AM;just speculate;;

DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:19 AM;what do YOU think?;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 09:19 AM;Speculate based on what?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:20 AM;"whatever you want, level of tech? references to other FF games?";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:20 AM;literally tons of things;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:20 AM;the fact that chocobos didn't exist til ff3;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:21 AM;it's a for fun conversation mostly;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:22 AM;I'm gonna say the original ff is the final one;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:22 AM;"I'm... sorry? Yes, this is a place to discuss things I guess, so Mycroft and I just gave our thoughts on your question";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:23 AM;but...;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:23 AM;i'll not elaborate;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:25 AM;"I mean, we're not stopping you, please do elaborate on why you think the original FF is the true 'final' fantasy";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:27 AM;I put it at the end because this is the point at which the warrior(s) of light are deadlocked in a literally never-ending battle with chaos it self;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:28 AM;Until you (the player) steps in and breaks the cycle.;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:30 AM;just seems like a fitting end to the series;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 09:31 AM;Do you mean like within the games themselves or to us in our measure of time?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:31 AM;"I mean, if you were to place them in order";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:32 AM;which happened first;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:32 AM;which happened last;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:32 AM;then FF1 would be last;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:32 AM;"if you count TAY as canon, then I could hear a good argument for why it comes last";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:32 AM;which I've considered myself;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:33 AM;"FF IV: The After Years, that is";;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 09:33 AM;So you're assuming they all exist on the same timeline?;;

DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:36 AM;"Maybe even on the same planet, eons apart.";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:36 AM;a lot of things could be explained this way.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:36 AM;What do you mean by own world?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:37 AM;As in planet or dimension or something?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:37 AM;maybe I misspoke;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;"Ahhh, haha that's okay";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;"FF7 has a Midgar, which is unique to FF7";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;FF1 has cornelia;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;and all it's locations;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;this could be due to being on completely different planets;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;"or, what makes more sense thinking scientifically";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:38 AM;"is that they're on the same planet, eons apart";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:39 AM;which could explain why each iteration has so many things in common;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:40 AM;why do the landmasses look different you ask?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:40 AM;Continental drift;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:41 AM;"I mean. 2 planets independant of one-another both having chocobos, goblins, and moogles";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:41 AM;nah;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 09:41 AM;If we are to assume that they're all part of the same universe/multiverse;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 09:41 AM;I'd argue that they all take place at roughly the same time;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:42 AM;I wasn't talking in terms of alternate universes;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:42 AM;"But, I can see your point";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:42 AM;"Final Fantasy it's in the name, right?";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:42 AM;each game is one of the many possibilities;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:43 AM;"Each one is the respective 'final' fantasy for their own existense, yea?";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:43 AM;is that what you're getting at;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:43 AM;?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 09:46 AM;or am I assuming too much?;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 10:00 AM;Close enough;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 10:01 AM;I don't really consider the Final Fantasy name;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 10:02 AM;"Just the shared creatures, themes, and divine entities";;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:03 AM;I always figured they are staples of the series that make the game a final fantasy game. The ties usually end there but some of them do have other ties;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:03 AM;There's that old Shinra theory for X and VII I believe;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:04 AM;I can't remember if it was scrapped in versus but the XIII games were meant to share a pantheon with other games. (They do with Type 0 but you are meaning mainline games);;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 10:05 AM;yeah xv was stripped of references to fabula nova crystalis;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 10:06 AM;or should I say versus 13 was stripped of them;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:13 AM;let's just admit;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:14 AM;that versus 13 is nonexistant;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:14 AM;because XV is not it;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:18 AM;it was basically a pipe dream from the beginning;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:24 AM;"Since we're talking hypothetically, I can imagine all the FFs actually being on one planet";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:24 AM;The crystals would be the physical manifestation of the flow of the planet;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:25 AM;And they behave like phoenixes where they would die and resurrect every thousand or even millions of years;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:26 AM;"And each time they die and resurrect, the whole planet dies and resurrects too, drastically changing its physical structure";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:28 AM;"Therefore, every FF would be the true 'final' for each of their ages";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:29 AM;Where humanity or whatever race present at that age inevitably lead themselves to corruption and chaos;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:30 AM;"And then the Warriors of Light or be it whatever they're called at that time, would then gain power from the crystals to bring back light to the world";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:31 AM;"However, having given power to those heroes, the crystals then die out together with the world";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:31 AM;And the cycle begins again;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:32 AM;~~Some strong hypotheticals here~~;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:32 AM;~~Ikr~~;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:33 AM;It kinda happens in FFXIV too;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:33 AM;They tell you about a Calamity that once befell their world and how the Warriors of Light fought together with them to go against the empire;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:34 AM;"Then something something happens, ~~I honestly don't know because I skip 90% of the dialogue~~, and they say they had forgotten about who the Warriors of Light were";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:35 AM;But they do remember the Warriors of Light actually being there at one time;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:36 AM;"Not to be the party pooper or anything here. I know that you're talking about hypotheticals and not trying to reason that this is actually what happens or anything., , That being said, it just wouldn't work. Several of the games (2?, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13 trilogy) have nothing at all to do with crystals or warriors of light. Even if they did, you'd have a really tough time explaining away the two planets in Nova Chrysalis and gods existing";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:36 AM;Smh skipping all that dialogue the writers worked ~~on for five minutes~~ so hard on;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:37 AM;"Okay, so looking at it like that, live die repeat, crystals as a pheonix etc";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:37 AM;one had to come before the others;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:37 AM;"That's why my first answer was that the question was unanswerable to my opinion, by hey, it's an interesting concept right? *nervous laugh*";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:37 AM;and one had to be last in line;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:38 AM;which would you place at the end of the line?;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:38 AM;I mean we established that it was a hypothetical that ignored some thing already so that was a pointless comment  @Rasea#1840 it was just for fun;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:38 AM;even if it just boils down to opinion;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:38 AM;I'm interested regardless;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:39 AM;They don't even measure time in the same way so obviously it wouldn't work;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:39 AM;It's just a hypothetical for fun;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:40 AM;Apologies then :p;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:41 AM;:trolltabata:;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:41 AM;"also, it could be argued that magicite is the FF6 incarnation of crystals";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:41 AM;same as Materia in FF7;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:41 AM;spheres in 10;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:41 AM;etc and so forth;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:42 AM;"To answer Rasea's statement, sure crystals may not have been mentioned to have any direct correlations in certain FFs, but doesn't deny their existence, like the crystals could still control the flow of the planet but reside in the planet's core thus, people not knowing about them. And I did say, the Warriors of Light could come in many different variations in each of the ages., I don't know about the Nova Chrysalis thing tho, so idk *shrug*";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:43 AM;"Like in FF13, the crystals power could have manifestated into the Falcie? Lcie? I dunno those godly beings lmao";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:43 AM;So easy to remember :>;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:43 AM;No;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:43 AM;So hard;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:43 AM;My memory is like a goldfish;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 10:44 AM;"I already forgot who you are ~~Rasea~~ I mean, Amelia";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:44 AM;Nice going 👍;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:44 AM;"And see, that's kind of my issue with FF personally";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:45 AM;"It's all absolute. There's not really anything left up to interpretation. Either you're given very little information about things (a la the old games) and thus it's boring in most cases or really basic, or you have a crapload of information to sift through, which turns everything into an absolute rather than leaving it open ended or having any level of mystery to anything";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:48 AM;"It's because of that, that I find the manifestation of crystals as magicite/materia/spheres hard to realistically believe., Magicite is the result of kidnapping espers and siphoning their magic power, or the espers willingly turning themselves into magicite to aid the good group., , Materia... you could possibly make a case or that? As it's the life blood of the planet and such, but I find that weird because crystals change in how they can be used from game to game. Sometimes they're only allowed to be used by the warriors of light (FF1, FF5), sometimes they can be stolen or manipulated for power (FF4, FF15)., , The rest is... egh. And they don't even exist in FF12 period. It's just a big ass political war with various armies and tech";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:48 AM;There's just so little room for interpretation;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:53 AM;FF12 has magicite and nethicite which is you argue they are a different name for crystals would be crystals. The origin of the most powerful pieces is called the Sun-cryst. Could be a reference for crystal but what do I know :trolltabata:;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 10:54 AM;It's all fun anyway considering nothing is fact within the universe until it is specifically stated;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:54 AM;"Yeah, but it almost always is stated as fact. Not really a lot of ??? laying around there";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:55 AM;"But also, FF games don't really do a lot of world building either. They don't try to create a crazy, immersive world rich in lore and history or anything. It's almost always a backdrop for your characters";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:56 AM;"There's exceptions, of course. Like FF12. It's a massive world with all kinds of cultures and histories and people";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:58 AM;You said but I find that weird because crystals change in how they can be used from game to game. ;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:58 AM;which perfectly fits the different incarnations;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:58 AM;"in some games, they're small enough to be held in your hand";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:58 AM;"in others, they're enormous (XV is a prime example here)";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:59 AM;it's just raw magical power manifested into a stone;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 10:59 AM;"By which I meant some games allow them to be abused by anyone. Like how... whatshisface from FF4 goes around stealing crystals to obtain power on the moon. In others, they're directly tied to the warriors of light and are unusable by anyone but them (FF1, FF15)";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 10:59 AM;that's what it boils down to;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:00 AM;the crystals themselves don't even have consistent themes across the games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:00 AM;in IV's universe they're very similar to alien tech;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:00 AM;and come from a different planet altogether;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:01 AM;and in FF7 they're pretty much so abundant that practically anyone can have one;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:02 AM;but they also aren't all powerful in FF7 either;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:02 AM;"lack of concistency doesn't negate the thoery, however";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:03 AM;"in a lot of zelda games, the triforce is something you can physically touch";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:03 AM;"in other zelda games, it's not, it comes from within the chosen 3";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:03 AM;"That's the thing, when I say I'm speaking hypothetically, I mean 100% hypothetically. When I say crystals control the flow of the world, this not only comprises of power and energy, it could also comprise of time, space, matter or even life. Basically crystals could be the God in the FF universe";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:03 AM;it's still the triforce;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:04 AM;"in wind waker, it's scattered into dozens of pieces";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:04 AM;"others, it's 3";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:05 AM;"in OG zelda, it's 8 pieces";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:05 AM;I know it doesn't exactly pertain to this argument;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:06 AM;but it gets my point across;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:06 AM;"Yeah but Zelda is stupid. I don't mean that offensively or anything, but the timeline is just weird and a lack of consistency makes it hard to really create faith that everything exists within a single universe on the same planet chronologically";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:07 AM;"I mean, same thing applies to final fantasy";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:07 AM;"but here we are, doing just that";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:07 AM;I'm arguing that inconsistency doesn't mean it's not the same thing;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:08 AM;touching the triforce in a link to the past transforms the entire planet as you wish it;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:08 AM;"As opposed to something like Kingdom Hearts. Which has all kinds of details scattered throughout, but at least it's consistent ~~despite rando asspulls from Nomura~~";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:08 AM;touching it in wind waker does squat;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:08 AM;"Yeah, but kingdom hearts takes place in a short amount of time";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:08 AM;a decade?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:09 AM;final fantasy and/or zelda;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:09 AM;spans literal eons;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:09 AM;But that's just my personal opinion on universes in game series;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:10 AM;"Keeping each story entirely seperate from the other as far as lore, worldbuilding and canon stuff goes, makes it believeable. It's hard to make it believeable if you argue it's all somehow magically connected to everything else in some way";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:11 AM;"And if you make it connected, then you have to make it consistent. Having stuff contradict other stuff and change all the time left and right kind of flips that on its head";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:11 AM;That's not true;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:12 AM;that connectivity requires consistency;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:12 AM;Unless you argue for some weird each thing is in a seperate dimension or something;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:13 AM;"Nah, it doesn't need to be that way.";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:13 AM;"If we can agree that the crystals are merely raw magical power, manifested in stone";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:13 AM;then they can manifest in different ways each time;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:13 AM;what's the problem there?;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:14 AM;"in FF7, materia occurs both naturally and is created in a lab (much in the same way diamonds are done in real life)";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:14 AM;Fair enough;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:14 AM;magicite is similar;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:14 AM;"I prefer standing on firm, official, canon ground. But do what you will";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:15 AM;this doesn't break canon;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:15 AM;it never explicitly states whether the games are in the same universe or not;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:15 AM;unless you count FFIV the after years as canon;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:16 AM;"and if you do, then they are all connected";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:16 AM;and FFIV comes later than any of them;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:17 AM;"inb4 Squeenix is like nope they're not connected, they're all completely seperate";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:17 AM;Barring direct sequels like the FF13 trilogy;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:18 AM;"but again, ffiv the after years directly contradicts that";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:18 AM;not sure if you've played it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:19 AM;there is no reason not to count it as canon;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:19 AM;but a certain character directly mentions that they're all in the same universe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:19 AM;it's a direct continuation;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:19 AM;but I don't want to say too much;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:19 AM;because it's a little spoilery;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:19 AM;Also decided to google do final fantasy games take place in the same universe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:20 AM;"as a matter of fact, there's not much in FF in general that isn't";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:21 AM;"Strangely enough, there's conflicting evidence on both sides (weirdly enough)";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:21 AM;"On one hand, there's..., ```No. Even if we assume that all the other FF games took place in galaxies within the same universe and never touched upon one another, at the end of Lightning Returns, Lightning either unmakes and remakes the universe, or transports her universe into ours, either way, it ends in a different universe than in which it began.```";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:21 AM;"But on the other hand, there's the fact that the interdimensional rift allows travel to other places. And FF4: TAY implies that all the games take place within the same universe but on different planets. At which point you could argue for a multiverse, which is entirely possible. And probably necessary considering what Lightning did";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:23 AM;honestly I think all of this is a huge reach;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:24 AM;I mean there's ways of tying things together but idk it gets undone with every game that tries to do something outlandish;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:24 AM;LR being one of those games;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:25 AM;Yeah. Later games contradict stuff a lot and there's no real way to connect anything without contradicting five other things;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:26 AM;"I just consider it all to be seperate, which is likely what Squeenix intended since they took references to other games out with the iOS remakes";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:26 AM;for which game?;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:28 AM;"Uh, XV is what I read. It had/has references to earlier games and that was removed. Evidently there's also crap like Zidane referencing Cloud & Squall despite being disconnected from those stories/worlds entirely";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:29 AM;oh;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:29 AM;But yeah. Seperate imo unless it's blatantly a sequel to something;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:31 AM;"I could argue that lightning returns took, and it's two previous games";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:31 AM;took place before any other final fantasy game did;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:31 AM;and that lightning remaking the universe is what set all the other games in motion;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:31 AM;The Ultimania guides also poop on the possibility of the games being connected at all;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;But believe what you will :p;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaacccccccchhhhhh;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;"you know, I did say";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;at the very beginning of this convo;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;let's assume hypothetically;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;that they ARE connected;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:32 AM;so all this trying to prove that they aren't is irrelevant anyways;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:33 AM;"the point is that even if you try to assume, it doesn't make sense lol";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:33 AM;just seems like you're trying to disprove it to suck all the fun out of this conversation;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:34 AM;I honestly don't see why it couldn't;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:34 AM;Jisoo didn't read up before joining;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:34 AM;Lol;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:34 AM;"make sense, that is";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:34 AM;it makes no less sense than the zelda timeline;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:35 AM;which I equate to nothing more than a game of telephone;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:35 AM;they're either a series of events;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:35 AM;or different versions of the same story;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:35 AM;I hate the Zelda timeline;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:36 AM;"what I meant is that even if you assume they are connected, the games themselves constantly disprove that assumption so it ends up being a bunch of abstract concepts that loosely tie things together";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:36 AM;until the next game breaks that bond;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:36 AM;but how do they?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:36 AM;then you have to find another way to bring them together;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:36 AM;"4 warriors of light, crystal bearers";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:36 AM;"I can say, the world is an imbalance";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:37 AM;and the crystals are seeking to fix that;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:37 AM;"so then, only the 4 warriors can use their power";;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:37 AM;Jisoo is connected to Kweebs :trolltabata:;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:37 AM;"the point with LR is a good example, you could've found a way to say that all of the games linked up perfectly";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:38 AM;but everything got remade so either the tie becomes that the other games took place after LR;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:38 AM;OR;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:38 AM;before;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:38 AM;one could argue that it's the final nail in the coffin;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:38 AM;LR and FFXIII's own universe erased all of the others;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:38 AM;The thing is... we don't even believe what we're saying 😅;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;because if the games took place before LR;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;I'm just spouting utter nonsense;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;then they all ended when that game hit the reset button;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;That's the whole point of this convo;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;"Honestly, it is just nonsense";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;"well, Jisoo, they were pretty much over already";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;Exactly;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:39 AM;if they came before LR-reset;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;"which is why I said, it's a huge reach";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;This convo is supposed to be a huge reach;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;oh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;well then carry on;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;That is the point we're trying to say;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;(waste my time 2018);;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:40 AM;I don't believe one bit about what I said lmao;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:41 AM;I'm saying it for the heck of it;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:41 AM;it's all a big hypothetical anyways.;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:41 AM;I mean they said it multiple times during your rant lmao;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:41 AM;"assuming they were connected, which game is the final fantasy";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:41 AM;that's the original question;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:41 AM;I guess;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;"also, not looking for a definitive answer";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;just your opinion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;my opinion is that there is none;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;The final fantasy is the one that Squeenix makes that everyone hates so much that it destroys the IP entirely;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;:trolltabata:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;"Yeah, I and Mycroft already said that";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;So you mean XV?;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:42 AM;XV was fun mate :GWqlabsKek:;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;"lol, I'm not hating";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;"Nah, some people like it. It's not bad enough yet";;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;Need to go worse;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;*several people are typing*;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;just pointing out that most people consider it the worst;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;Hello Caius ma boy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;"XV was trash, and FF as a brand is still profitable";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;or at least a lot of vocal tards on the internet;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;so not yet;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;they would need to make a few more games like XV;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;The problem with FFXV is that it was called Final Fantasy.;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;That's been my opinion since I first played it.;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;"On it's own, it's a good enough game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;to the point where it starts to hurt FF as a brand;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:43 AM;That was the problem with XIII as well;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;"But it's so far away from what everyone knows as final fantasy, that it hurts the brand";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;what is the basis of good enough;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;"it means I played it, and enjoyed it for what it was";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;Welcome Doc;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;<a:PixelPepeFedora:498679800001593344>;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;but it doesn't hold up as a final fantasy game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;fair enough then;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:44 AM;I saw you;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;it's just too far separated from the rest of the series;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;this is a really convo pertaining to what exactly?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;but I just think that XV wouldn't stand on it's own if it didn't have the FF brand backing it;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;You always have the problem in series that none of the games can exist in a vacuum and are always inevitably compared to the others in the series;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;It was a fine game lol;;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;Funny af;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;"I had the most fun fishing in XV. unpopular opinion, I know";;
Caius#6568;22-Dec-18 11:45 AM;Remember not to go against Jisso tho he called people who like XV shills the other day :GWqlabsKek:;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:46 AM;"Even disregarding all the FF crap, XV's launch was a nightmare with a confusing story and an empty world with a brain dead combat system";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:46 AM;when did I say that?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:46 AM;that was action;;
Rasea#1840;22-Dec-18 11:46 AM;"Like, how do you have hundreds of good ARPG examples and make... that";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:46 AM;@Doctor_Vile#6548 The original question was DrCidd asking which FF would be the true final fantasy in hypothetical terms and now the convo has evolved through many forms to become Is FFXV a good game?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;And I made the chat die again;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;lol;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;:hohohohohoho:;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;I do like fishing minigames in other games;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;"nobody wants to answer the question, they just want to argue that they're not connected";;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;Popularity be damned;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:47 AM;"I would answer the question but I'm supposed to be heading to bed rn, so can't";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;I answered the question already;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;with a non answer;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;"XV's wasn't the best I've tried, but it had lots of fun bits to it";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;you said none of them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;it just wasn't the answer you were looking for;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;you asked for an opinion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;I gave one;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;so I should word the question differently;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;probably;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:48 AM;"assuming they're in-universe, and on a timeline";;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:49 AM;which game falls at the end of the timeline;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:49 AM;"@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 Jisoo, I and Mycroft already gave that same answer, so yeah";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:49 AM;So we started talking hypothetically instead;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:49 AM;"I say, FF1 falls at the very end";;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:52 AM;The real question is;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:52 AM;What's for breakfast?;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:52 AM;"If a Red Mage learns Blue Magic, does he then become a Purple Mage?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:53 AM;"finally, something worth discussing";;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:54 AM;"Well, the answer is no";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:54 AM;:thinkingtom:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:54 AM;Because I need to go to bed;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:54 AM;I do not accept this answer;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:54 AM;Sleep is for the weak;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;but how did the red mage become red if it only knows white and black magic;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;And the weak have no say in these matters;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;I'm stronger than you Mycroft;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;1v1 me on XIV;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;Ok.;;

Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;I-I-I was k-kidding;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;I mean Red mage is a combo of black and white magic so would adding another class necessitate a name change in class?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:55 AM;I'm a smol boi;;
DrCidd#2442;22-Dec-18 11:56 AM;A red mage is red because he is well read.;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:56 AM;hue;;

Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:57 AM;"I assume it will be like Blue Velvet, but with more blood";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-Dec-18 11:57 AM;now it's time to listen to red flavor;;

Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:58 AM;So if black and white are considered opposites;;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:58 AM;and they combine into red;;
Izwar Vain#5689;22-Dec-18 11:58 AM;@Doctor_Vile#6548 It's a curse I tell ya!;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:58 AM;this is an important question;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:58 AM;"Aye, it be a terrible curse";;
Malfred#1000;22-Dec-18 11:58 AM;I guess this means that they were just always extreme dark and bright shades of red?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;22-Dec-18 11:59 AM;I mean black+white don't exactly form a colour;;

Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:05 PM;So how much will Zodiac compatibility affect a White Mage/Time Mage?  I made characters based off my family and my wife is a Leo which apparently has terrible compatibility with myself (Taurus Ramza) and another of my characters (Male Scorpio).  Can high Faith overcome this or should I really rethink her jobs?;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:05 PM;This is for Final Fantasy Tactics btw;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:06 PM;"High Faith can easily make magic more effective, but the only way to permanently increase it is to get a mediator with the Praise skill";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:06 PM;"Wait no, Preach";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:07 PM;"If you want decent faith, i'd say go between 75-85";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:08 PM;"Also note: the Preach skill gives 4 Faith in battle, and when you finish that battle, you get a 1 point increase in faith";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:10 PM;"yeah, I've done the Mediator stuff before, I was just curious if that will be enough to make things like Protect and Haste stick on my units she has bad compatibility with";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:10 PM;since she'll be buffing a lot as a White Mage/Time Mage;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:11 PM;"and out of the three she'll be buffing, she has worse compat with Ramza, bad with the Scorpio, and neutral with the Virgo";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:11 PM;Ah;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:11 PM;so I wasn't sure if high enough Faith could overcome that or not;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:11 PM;or if I should rethink her jobs;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:12 PM;"Trust me, you need the faith if you want her to become a good mage";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:12 PM;Having lack of decent faith will cause stuff like Protect and Shell to miss occasionally;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:12 PM;And healing won't be as effective;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:13 PM;"yeah, I'll be pumping that and Brave as soon as I unlock Mediator with her";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:14 PM;"Oh also, on the side note, I recommend you unlock all the White, Black, Time, and Mystic/Oracle abilities";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:14 PM;"or I could wait for Ramza to get that skill that boosts Brave in Chapter 2, I dunno";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:14 PM;"Nah, I'm doing a challenge run of sorts";;

Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:14 PM;the Scorpio is Knight/Monk;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:15 PM;Leo is White Mage/Time Mage;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:15 PM;Virgo is Black Mage/Oracle;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:15 PM;and I'll be sticking only to those two jobs for each;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:15 PM;"For the time being, unless you have the Raise Faith skill for the Oracle, use it on her";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:16 PM;Otherwise you're just gonna have to grind;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:16 PM;"yeah, I'm going to try to avoid grinding as much as I can this time around but I'll at least boost faith on her and my Virgo in Chapter 1";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:17 PM;"I'm just dreading Dorter, I usually over level every playthrough so it's been awhile since I've done a lower level Dorter";;

Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:18 PM;and no Archer's means only my mages and Ramza have any range and Throw Stone is Throw Stone lol;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:18 PM;she's ok;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:18 PM;she's mid-high 60's;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:18 PM;I'll probably get her up to 80 or so;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:19 PM;"Heh, that's okay-ish I guess";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:19 PM;she does pretty good damage for the first few fights I've used her in so far;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:19 PM;I tried to roll her with higher Faith;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:19 PM;I was just a little lazy with my Leo;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:20 PM;lol;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:20 PM;It's been a year or two since I've played FFT though and I forgot just how much I love this game;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:20 PM;Same;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:21 PM;You should probably buff ramza up with praise and preach (when you get the mediator);;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:22 PM;"Actually wait, if you're not gonna be using magic for him, then avoid raising his faith level";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:22 PM;"Faith raises magic hit and power, but also decreases resistance from magic";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:24 PM;"So if you have the Doubt Faith skill on you, then you should use it on your non-magic units with reasonably high faith";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:24 PM;"yeah, it's funny how they did it, it's like you can be affected less by magic just by not believing in it";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:25 PM;basically your characters hold their hands over their ears and pretend magic doesn't exist and so it just doesn't for them as much;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:25 PM;Im sure you're aware what happens to units when they have too much faith;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:25 PM;yeah;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:25 PM;and too little brave;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:26 PM;I remember back in the day I used to make Beowulf turn enemies into chickens to grind in peace;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:26 PM;lol;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:27 PM;then I got older and just discovered Accumulate strats and stopped beating my own guys up all the time;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:27 PM;"I usually grind in the mandalia plains, but I fucking hate it when chocobos show up";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:28 PM;"Their stupid faces piss me off, as well as their healing ability";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:28 PM;"yeah, they are obnoxious in the early game";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:29 PM;"and when you level too high but don't advance to get better equipment, monsters in general can be terrible";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:30 PM;Yeah..;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:31 PM;"I remember when I thought stuff like MP was scarce, but then I remembered, who needs Ether when you have Chakra";;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:32 PM;"yeah, and I always used to go with what the game suggested for equipment on everyone meaning I never used robes or hats on my mages and missed out on a bunch of MP I could have used";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:33 PM;I honestly don't know how much Chakra can recover if you have a max leveled monk;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;22-Dec-18 02:34 PM;I should probably check that out in case;;
Ramza Beoulve#1955;22-Dec-18 02:35 PM;is it based on PA I wonder?  I never really looked into it either;;

Shizu#2933;25-Dec-18 05:19 PM;Should I avoid playing Lightning Returns until I finish XIII-2?;;
Caius#6568;25-Dec-18 05:45 PM;I think LR has datalogs that tell you how things happened. I think XIII-2 is quite good though so I'd give it a shot if that's an option. A few side quests and things will make more sense if you play it too.;;
Shizu#2933;25-Dec-18 05:52 PM;"Ok, It's just that I got LR for Christmas, but I'm also ~20 hours into 2, I guess the question is if I would get lost in the beginning of LR without finishing 2?";;
Rasea#1840;25-Dec-18 05:55 PM;"Uhhh... sort of. 13-2 involves a lot of fluff, but there are important bits in 13-2. The beginning with Lightning which you've already seen. The important bits are basically backstory on Noel and Caius and why everyone is doing what they're doing. And the events of 13-2 directly lead into LR and Lightning's journey in it";;
Rasea#1840;25-Dec-18 05:55 PM;"You wouldn't be *too* lost as you can make some fairly accurate guesses as to what happened, but I'd still recommend sticking out 13-2. For the story, that is. I just beat the story and moved onto LR";;
