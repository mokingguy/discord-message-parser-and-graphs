Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:38 PM;"Well, that just spoiled some things for me";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:39 PM;just pretend it never happened;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:39 PM;🤔;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:40 PM;"Nope, that 'alternate reality' is gonna bug me till I finish the game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:40 PM;honestly idek why that's even under the game's section;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:41 PM;the only thing they ever confirmed to not be real was the omen trailer;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:42 PM;Mobile titles oh good lord...;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:49 PM;"hmm, there doesn't seem to be any other information about what they're showing just yet";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:49 PM;"or well, I can't find it atleast";;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:54 PM;"If I can just get a Sturdy Helixhorn, I can finally upgrade my engine blade to the ultima blade...";;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:54 PM;And then finally finish some of the side quests I've been putting off;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:55 PM;I gave up on trying to get it;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:56 PM;There are two hunts that allow you to get it;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:57 PM;*The Last Spiracorns* and *Scrap It Now!*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:57 PM;The main reason I gave up was because I know it probably would've just made the game even easier than it already was;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:57 PM;"The former has a very low chance of actually netting you a sturdy helixhorn, the latter has a high chance but you need to have hunter rank 7";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:58 PM;ah;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:58 PM;You can find both of them in Old Lestallum;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:59 PM;I will probably fooling around with Ragnarok for the rest of this game's life span;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 03:59 PM;Ragnorok?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 03:59 PM;the new dlc weapon;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:00 PM;"Ah, I haven't been able to download any of the updates or DLC yet";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:00 PM;some are locked to the season pass;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:00 PM;including Ragnarok sadly;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:00 PM;"it isn't that great, but I think it looks cool";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:01 PM;especially when warp striking (which deals a shitload of damage for some reason);;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:04 PM;"I have the code for the Masamune DLC weapon, been itching to get it because I just love Katanas in general. If only the PS4 wasn't such a piece of shit at connecting to the wifi";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:05 PM;hm? I never had a problem with it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:05 PM;other than wishing the base PS4 model had a 5ghz wifi adapter but w/e;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:07 PM;"I'm using the landlord's wifi until I can get my own internet connection. It's through several walls. My Laptop can connect just fine, but my PS4 just doesn't seem to form a stable connection";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:10 PM;ah I see;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:10 PM;You could find create makeshift solution by just attaching an ethernet adapter between your laptop and ps4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:10 PM;and briding the connections;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:13 PM;"So this Ethernet adapter, is it a router?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:13 PM;oh a cable sorry;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:13 PM;"Ah, so I just connect the cable directly to the PS4 then?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:13 PM;my mind is racing because im trying to do multiple things at once lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:13 PM;yeah;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:14 PM;Gotcha;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:18 PM;there was a time where my router had randomly stopped working through wifi so the only way to get internet connection was through ethernet so for like a week I had to use that trick to my online games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 04:18 PM;"like bloodborne pvp, or gta online";;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:29 PM;Huh... My PC isn't recognizing the LAN cable;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 04:34 PM;Must be a driver issue;;
Crab#6594;01-Mar-17 05:00 PM;Why not just have Ignis drive then;;
Crab#6594;01-Mar-17 05:00 PM;:Smug1:;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 05:01 PM;Hehehehe;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 05:02 PM;"I can't talk much while I'm bridging the connection, so I bid thee adieu until I get all the updates sorted";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 05:02 PM;good luck;;
Crab#6594;01-Mar-17 05:13 PM;oh wow a king's tale is free now;;

Crab#6594;01-Mar-17 06:33 PM;Cause that makes sense;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:32 PM;holy shit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:32 PM;those screenshots of the game running on the new 1080 Ti are lit;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:42 PM;also did they leak some upcoming dlc boss fight? I don't remember a cerberus boss being in the game;;
themockingguy#6969;01-Mar-17 07:43 PM;Looks amazing!;;
themockingguy#6969;01-Mar-17 07:44 PM;Now i need a gaming pc if they ever port it;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 07:44 PM;"Damn, that indeed looks awesome";;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 07:45 PM;Will it run on 1060?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:45 PM;maybe at a lower quality setting;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:46 PM;depends on how optimized it is;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 07:47 PM;"I'm hoping it's as optimized as MGSV was, but seeing SE's latest ports... I'm not so sure it's going to be optimized all that well";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:47 PM;fingers crossed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:48 PM;it won't be as bad as the FF13 Saga;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:48 PM;since it is likely they are using atleast DirectX 11;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:48 PM;instead of 9 which is what the 360's GPU was designed for(along with OpenGL 2);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:49 PM;there are no modern day cards coming with optimizations for DX9(over 15 years old) idk why they were so damn lazy when porting but w/e;;
Davkilla101#0932;01-Mar-17 07:50 PM;*fingers crossed for vulkan support*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:50 PM;^;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Mar-17 07:50 PM;DX12 should be secured since that's what Angi's Philosophy was rendered with;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:47 AM;Oh man the 13 trilogy is so bad;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:47 AM;I shouldn't be getting drops on a game from 2012 on my card;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:47 AM;What's your graphics card?;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:47 AM;I get regular ones - especially in 13-2 - to 30;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:47 AM;GTX 970;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;...Wat... That is a shitty port;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;Barely any optimization;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;(I didn't mean to insult the game there for clarification - the port is genuinely awful);;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;I think it's like 50GB too;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;About as much space as Fallout 4;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;Most games nowadays are that size or bigger;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;And correct me if I'm wrong but;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:48 AM;Witcher 3 was less than that too;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:49 AM;PSO2 is like 32GB IIRC;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:49 AM;I know but for a game in 2010-12 it's just;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:49 AM;Wow;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:49 AM;Oh man;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 01:50 AM;"If it comes out on PC I might rush to finish the console version, I've been putting off going further because of this whole additional stuff they're putting in";;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:52 AM;"Yeah, I started downloading the patch earlier today after I figured out how to bridge the connection from my laptop (which can connect to the landlord's wifi) to the PS4 (which cannot connect to said wifi). Over 12GB of data and I haven't finished dowloading it yet";;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:53 AM;I heard a rumor that they're going to add in some pre-departure content as well;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:54 AM;From when Noct was just a kid;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 01:56 AM;That's what happens when you port a game from a console that uses a 15 year old graphics api and was designed with 30fps 720p in mind;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:56 AM;">30fps, , *cringes*";;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 01:57 AM;That framrate gives me motion sickness;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 01:59 AM;what's even more funny is that they ported the 360 version with all of graphical bugs and frame drops;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:00 AM;but had they ported the PS3 version it would've been a million times worse because they would have to port from a different processor type entirely;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:00 AM;I don't mind 30FPS;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:00 AM;"Yeah, PS3 had one of the weirdest architectures ever";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:00 AM;and the PS3 version abused the cell processor to keep the game running well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:01 AM;"maybe one day, they will fix it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:01 AM;"then again, it probably won't matter";;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:01 AM;They did a lot of tricks to keep games running haha;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:01 AM;since whatever future hardware exists will iron out the performance issues;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:02 AM;Didn't they say they're lucky Red Dead Redemption works so well or something?;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:02 AM;And the reason it's not on PC is that it would literally just break;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:02 AM;probably;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:02 AM;though the 2013 games were more technically impressive for the system;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:02 AM;especially GTA 5 and TLoU;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:03 AM;Oh god they were;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:03 AM;"You have to understand that game devs are constantly working on crunch time to meet impossible deadlines, and this causes the game engine to be... quite hackish in nature";;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:03 AM;I remember them saying the PS3 was hard to develop for;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:03 AM;It is;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:03 AM;Which is weird thinking about ut;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;everyone said that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;because;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;It's like in the middle of the cycle they worked it out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;sony had barely any debugging tools;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;actually;;
HayleeLOL#0964;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;Because suddenly the PS3 picked up MASSIVELY;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;they have a horrible habit of not making it easy;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:04 AM;"I don't remember how many cores it had exactly, but they had to be accessed in a specific order. You can't accesss the cores randomly";;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:05 AM;It's not like in a PC or on the PS4 where you can load balance tasks between all available cores;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:05 AM;The thing about the PS3 is that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:05 AM;it was so different than what devs were used to;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:06 AM;because the PS1 and 2 uses the same type of hardware;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:06 AM;tell hellish to develop for;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:06 AM;but;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:06 AM;you know what kind of hardware you're using;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:06 AM;the PS3 was like being thrown onto an island with some basic tools and being told to survive;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:06 AM;And the island has some weird non-euclidian geometry to it;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Mar-17 02:08 AM;This video explains the weirdness of the PS3 really well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZrDIgQB_ns;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Mar-17 02:08 AM;im just glad those days are behind us as sony now uses x86 processors;;

Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 11:00 PM;the only thing I really didn't like aboot this game was magic;;

Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 11:01 PM;Though I guess I kinda get it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 11:01 PM;"friendly fire is fine, it makes you think first before mindlessly casting";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 11:01 PM;but there wasn't a lot of variation in spells;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 11:01 PM;which sucked;;
MaccasPasta#2532;13-Mar-17 11:01 PM;"yeah, it does give the game a bit more strategy";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 11:02 PM;"but atleast the ones it does have are useful, like the multi-cast spells";;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 11:02 PM;"Well, considering how OP magic is, haha";;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 11:02 PM;BUT I did like crafting spells;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:00 PM;precisely;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:00 PM;though I will say;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:01 PM;WoW isn't great these days;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:01 PM;but it was good at one point;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-May-17 05:01 PM;"I don't either, Warcraft was good and rather unique at the time IIRC";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:02 PM;"rather unique, , well it sorta started as a Warhammer clone";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:02 PM;but became more unique by Warcraft III;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:02 PM;"actually, I take that back";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:02 PM;it became more unique by the novels released between Warcraft II and Warcraft III;;

themockingguy#6969;22-May-17 05:02 PM;Like expensive?;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:05 PM;I was big into ARGs back in 2011 or so;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:05 PM;so TSW was of course of interest to me;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:05 PM;"alas, it was sub-based at the time";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:05 PM;so I didn't play it until more recently;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-May-17 05:06 PM;Was that the one that had a TV show component to it as well?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:06 PM;no;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:06 PM;but don't remember its name;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-May-17 05:06 PM;"Oh, cause I remember a game (I believe it was an MMO) that had a TV show component that was influenced by everyone's decisions";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:06 PM;yeah that was much much more recent;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-May-17 05:07 PM;It was a rather... Inventive concept;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:07 PM;"oh well, at least I have ESO for my MMO fix and The Black Watchmen for TSW-like investigation mission fix";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;22-May-17 05:07 PM;"good game, btw, high recommend on The Black Watchmen";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-May-17 05:11 PM;there really isn't too much of a purpose for them having two tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;22-May-17 05:12 PM;"which is why when XIV 1.0 released, it left people wondering why it even existed in the first place";;

Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:19 AM;so uh;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:19 AM;the direction they're taking their new games in is interestingf;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:19 AM;episodic releases;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:19 AM;long dlc cycles;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:19 AM;"only getting to have one out of many options ;_;";;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:21 AM;I'm fine with dlc but I don't want to see fewer new titles because of that;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:23 AM;releasing unfinished games;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:23 AM;idk what they're thinking;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 10:23 AM;they're sure to get a lot of backlash after this;;
HayleeLOL#0964;27-May-17 11:40 AM;"Indeed ;-;";;
HayleeLOL#0964;27-May-17 11:40 AM;Hm;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 11:45 AM;"Like I said before, the episodic things aren't gonna be like 2 hour or 3 hour mini games";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 11:46 AM;"they're gonna find a way to pad it up or make it seem longer than it should be, like I imagine there's gonna be more put into the initial part with midgar than the original game ever had hence why this is a full blown remake and not just an enhanced port";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 11:47 AM;"as for XV, that's more a guilt trip because they wanted more content in the game than they had time to make due to the forced 3 year dev cycle";;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 12:00 PM;forced dev cycles are dumb imo;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 12:00 PM;just release it whenever you're ready;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 12:01 PM;I'm fine with waiting another year or two if it makes the game noticably better;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:01 PM;"forced because deadlines matter for AAA, a lot more than games with a lower budget";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:02 PM;money > gamers;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 12:02 PM;true :p;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 12:02 PM;"~~at least I buy my games off steam, so it should have most if not all of the content~~";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:03 PM;though tbh some of the blame does go to the dev team;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:03 PM;dicking around with Luminous during the development of the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:03 PM;they clearly don't know how to manage their time like some other devs do like the ones who made Horizon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:03 PM;or Surge;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:04 PM;what's worse is that they spent a large portion of the game's dev period making the engine and it still runs like crap so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:04 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-May-17 12:05 PM;If they do use it again I hope they don't pull off major rewrites and just work with what they have for the time being;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 03:36 PM;actually episodic releases might not be a bad thing;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-May-17 03:36 PM;they said each episode was the length of a full game apparently;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Jun-17 06:12 PM;censored about what;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:12 PM;because the game starts out literally about eco-terrorists;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:13 PM;"like I don't even say that as a joke, that's literally what AVALANCHE was";;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Jun-17 06:13 PM;idk I've heard people say that they think the honeybee inn is gonna be censored;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Jun-17 06:13 PM;what the hell would they censor that with though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:13 PM;well it'd be more controversial now than back then;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:13 PM;as for honeybee inn;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:13 PM;well there is the bath scene;;

Desert Stream~#1192;03-Jun-17 06:15 PM;idk why people get so upset about such things;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Jun-17 06:15 PM;because change is bad;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Jun-17 06:15 PM;according to them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Jun-17 06:16 PM;imagine how upset they will be when they find out you can't 3v1 a house anymore;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:19 PM;I'd be genuinely upset at that tbh;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:19 PM;FFVII had a lot of weird enemies;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Jun-17 06:19 PM;it's one of the greatest things about it;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 11:14 AM;yes the game's plot revolves around her specifically;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 11:15 AM;That's why Vaan gets the same hate Tidus does for not really having anything to do with what's going on;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;08-Jun-17 01:13 PM;I actually think it's an interesting narrative style;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 06:54 PM;Difference is Tidus actually is the main character of X while Vaan could be removed and little would change;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 06:55 PM;the changes from removing Tidus would've been for the better;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 06:55 PM;the only thing he offers is daddy issues and another cheesy love story;;

Desert Stream~#1192;08-Jun-17 07:01 PM;Tidus wasn't that bad imo;;

Desert Stream~#1192;08-Jun-17 07:12 PM;well yeah but;;
Desert Stream~#1192;08-Jun-17 07:12 PM;I mean the concept;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:12 PM;"they could've kept the same concept regardless, he's a standalone character";;
Desert Stream~#1192;08-Jun-17 07:13 PM;I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:13 PM;that just happens to be exactly like a dream/aeon;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:19 PM;Without Tidus we would have FF13.;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:20 PM;He is essential to the story. They tried doing the same thing with Vaan but failed miserably.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:20 PM;12?;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:24 PM;"Yeah, Tidus was the fish out of water to explain concepts to the audience so they were informed of what was going on in the world.";;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:26 PM;"They tried attempting this with Vaan, but, they forgot what they were doing halfway through the story seemingly. Then again that would match when, the man who could do no wrong, Matsuno dropped out of development.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:28 PM;I don't think they needed a fake lead to achieve that.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:28 PM;I feel like his existence would make more sense if him and Yuna grew up together;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:29 PM;rather than he got caught in weird shit and now he's 1000 years in the future (not really);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:29 PM;following a girl primarily because he liked her and she just so happens to like him too;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:30 PM;Well how is he a fake lead? Just because he's a dream? I would argue what he accomplished in the story is very real even if he's ultimately going to vanish.;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:30 PM;Well what else is he to do? I think Tidus realizes that having people around who would explain what's going on is very important.;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:30 PM;The last time he was on his own he almost died in the ruins before Riku and the AlBhed bailed him out.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:31 PM;as in he's given the role as the leading character when his importance is really not big enough for that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:31 PM;that's my main issue with him;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:31 PM;and Vaan too for that matter;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:32 PM;I would feel a lot better about both if Yuna and Ashe took the lead like both games imply they should;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:33 PM;Except he's not? His story is not the main one going on in the tale. We just experience his story and the main story and how they intertwine from time to time. The main story is Yuna dealing with her destiny and Sin.;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:33 PM;From his eyes*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:34 PM;"I know, so why not give the lead to Yuna?";;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:35 PM;Because of bow they wanted to tell the story. They wanted to keep the stranger in a foreign land vibe.;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:35 PM;Aldeo one second;;
Chimpy#5375;08-Jun-17 07:35 PM;Need to drive;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:36 PM;I have a lot to say on this in about 2 hours;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:36 PM;Tidus is very much the main character;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:37 PM;Yuna is very important and arguably a second protagonist;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:37 PM;"But it's Tidus' story, not Yuna's";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:38 PM;His story revolves around following her;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:38 PM;"If Yuna didn't exist, the game would've ended within the first 3 hours";;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:43 PM;Not true;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:43 PM;He's essentially an in person narrator only because he happens to just be tagging along with the rest of the group.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:45 PM;But couldn't that be done giving him a supporting role like the rest?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:45 PM;That's the real argument here;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:45 PM;But you could replace Yuna with any summoner;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:46 PM;And the game still follows Tidus;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:46 PM;Yuna is just the means to get Tidus to confront his father;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:46 PM;But that summoner would still feel essential to the overall plot;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:46 PM;Yes but that doesn't make them the main character;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:47 PM;"If you tell a story about a secret service agent, the president is going to be hugely important";;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:47 PM;But it doesn't make them the main character;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:48 PM;true but that depends on what role they both play in the story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:49 PM;If they made the game more about Tidus and his story being a personal thing rather than diary of his adventure with a group of strangers it would make more sense that he has the primary role;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:49 PM;The story is about Tidus;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:49 PM;It's about him overcoming his childish nature and confronting his issues with his father;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:50 PM;I meant giving his character a specific importance to what's going on;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:56 PM;"Then he should take the lead and make story more about his own journey, trials, etc... and less about this summoner girl he has a crush on.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 07:58 PM;They could've told the game's story a lot better had they truly pushed that he was the only one that could save Spira.;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:59 PM;Yuna doesn't lead the party either.  Auron does;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 07:59 PM;Why wouldn't he go with the people he knew in this strange land?;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:00 PM;Him having a crush on Yuna had nothing to do with it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 08:00 PM;He could've still travelled with them but the things that went on throughout the game should've had more of a solo focus on him;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:16 PM;"They definitely could have told it better, but that's true of every Square story.  And even if the story itself isn't written the best Tidus is still clearly the main character.   Unlike Vaan who is literally just there";;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:29 PM;Well maybe not clearly the main because we're able to have this debate;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:29 PM;But there is no question about the Ashe/Vaan bit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 08:37 PM;I just can never look at him as the main because of how the game's story plays out;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:48 PM;"Think of it this way, the game is Tidus' story.  He's essential.  But shortly into his story he meets Yuna and there stories get intertwined.  Yuna definitely has just as much growth and plot as Tidus, it's just that the plot of X focuses on Tidus rather than Yuna.";;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:48 PM;A large portion of X is Yuna's story as well as Tidus' because they're both happening at the same time and going for the same goal.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 08:54 PM;I suppose that's one of looking at it;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:55 PM;"I think at one point Tidus says it's no longer his story, that it's their story.";;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:55 PM;As in Tidus and Yuna's.;;
Davkilla101#0932;08-Jun-17 08:56 PM;"No no no, it will forever be Tidus' story :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 08:56 PM;and then before the final fight it's his again;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:56 PM;"And I think from Besaid on that's true, but the game starts in Zanarkand so it's technically about an hour's more Tidus' story.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 08:57 PM;wait when does he say it's our story? During Yunalesca's fight right?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 08:57 PM;or was it after;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 08:58 PM;I think it's right before the Yunalesca fight;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 09:00 PM;ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 09:00 PM;kinda weird he ends up going back to it's my story right at the end of the game lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 09:02 PM;I just watched the cutscene.  It's literally the line before the fight begins.;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 09:03 PM;Also I just realized we've been talking heavy spoilers outside of #spoilers;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 09:03 PM;We should probably migrate there;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 09:04 PM;"I might delete a few of the messages that have blatant spoilers in them as well, although I think they're mostly mine.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 09:07 PM;ah right;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 09:07 PM;too bad you can't move messages in discord;;
Dinoken2#0946;08-Jun-17 09:07 PM;Yeah it's a shame.  It was a good discussion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;08-Jun-17 09:07 PM;yeah;;

Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:03 PM;"Like... the SM anime actually takes place really early on in Ash's journey, and DP takes place much later?";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:05 PM;"here's a thought: Ash is a semi-perfect version of the child soldier that the entire pokémon training program tries to create, , because on the one hand he apparently can't die, but on the other he's a shitty trainer";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:05 PM;and don't pretend the point isn't to create child soldiers;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:07 PM;if I had the energy to do it I'd make one of those You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about memes with Ash vs. Red;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:08 PM;Its why I like the Pokemon Origins anime. Red is a shit trainer at first but he actually fucking learns and becomes a champion at the end;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:08 PM;"I prefer the Pokémon Red video game, where Red is a good trainer from the start :^)";;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;"Well, in the games he's only as good as the player";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;is it too much to ask for a genuinely dark pokemon story that doesn't mess up Lt. Surge though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;the games aren't dark enough;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;"Also, I was talking about the animes, not the games";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;and there is that one dark manga but it makes Lt. Surge evil;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;the pokemon world is clearly hinted to be dark and crapsack;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:09 PM;but we never really see it;;

Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:10 PM;Lt. Surge is evil in this fic;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:10 PM;I was referring to The Game of Champions;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:11 PM;Irredeamibly so;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:11 PM;no you see I *don't* want him to be evil;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:11 PM;the entire point is that he's not supposed to be;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:11 PM;but anyway you have a literal child soldier creation program implemented after an extremely devestating war;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:11 PM;"He's working with Team Rocket in this fic, actually";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:11 PM;you have a fucking poke-mafia that when you actually think about it is the lesser of all evils;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:12 PM;you have literal sentient weapons;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:12 PM;"Oh no, in this fic they're taking control of the food supply and slowly choking the life out of human civilization in Kanto";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:12 PM;okay yeah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:12 PM;I'm talking about in general;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:12 PM;I'd say that's downright sinister;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:13 PM;I'm talking about the main universe where Team Rocket was clearly created to stop the other Teams;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:13 PM;"In that fic I sent you, pokemon really are depicted as the monsters they are. A few chapters in a Gyarados levels Pallet Town";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:13 PM;nice;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:14 PM;Viridian Forest is also nightmare fuel;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:14 PM;in fact the part about using 10-year-old pokemon trainers in competition with one another as a substitute for the wars of old;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:14 PM;it's literally no different than Naruto;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:14 PM;At least pokemon hides that fact;;

Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:17 PM;Indeed;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:17 PM;especially when you take out that Team Rocket base together;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:18 PM;more like there wasn't any space left for a different theme for Red;;

Davkilla101#0932;25-Jun-17 10:18 PM;"I know, the devs had to do all sorts of shit to fit two regions into that cartridge, including memory alignment";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:19 PM;Iwata alone manually compressed all of the Johto content;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:19 PM;in a matter of a few nights;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:19 PM;so that the Kanto content would fit;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jun-17 10:19 PM;and it's not even all of Kanto;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jun-17 04:12 PM;"XII is getting actual praise and overall positive reception which is something I thought would never happen, XIII has been coming up a lot lately with some new found appreciation. XV is only collecting so much hate because it is new.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jun-17 04:12 PM;was much worse between the time of delay and december imo;;
ShiggyDig#9513;27-Jun-17 11:25 PM;XV will likely get praised once all of the DLCa are released and once everything that the game introduced will be explained;;
ShiggyDig#9513;27-Jun-17 11:25 PM;Such as the extremely random story arcs that are quickly introduced and thrown away;;
ShiggyDig#9513;27-Jun-17 11:26 PM;Characters leaving the party and why they left;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jun-17 11:26 PM;we already know why they left;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jun-17 11:26 PM;the only one that was a mystery was why gladio left;;
ShiggyDig#9513;27-Jun-17 11:27 PM;Right now about 1/3 of that content is still unexplained and it's what's causing the large Like/Hate ratio;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jun-17 11:27 PM;and no one priased his dlc arc;;
ShiggyDig#9513;27-Jun-17 11:27 PM;(Trying to avoid spoilers lol);;

ShiggyDig#9513;27-Jun-17 11:29 PM;like maybe it was explained but I didn't care as to why ariden did everything he did;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jun-17 11:30 PM;them releasing dlc for characters you saw through the entire game isn't gonna fix the overall problem this game's storytelling has;;

Mirron#9949;28-Aug-17 07:17 PM;Quistis isn't too broken I think. And Irvine.;;
Mirron#9949;28-Aug-17 07:17 PM;"Irvine especially I don't recall anything, I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting something with Blue Magic.";;
Vamp#0871;29-Aug-17 07:29 AM;"Quistis has Degenerator, which can kill anything that's not a boss, a Cactuar, a Tonberry or a Grat.";;
Vamp#0871;29-Aug-17 07:31 AM;Irvine has some shots that can easily reach the damage limit even if his STR stat isn't capped.;;
Chimpy#5375;29-Aug-17 07:48 AM;"To be fair, Squall is all you need for the whole game, FF8 is a sad case of being too easy to break to let anyone else shine.";;
Vamp#0871;29-Aug-17 09:19 AM;You have the Junction system to blame for that.;;
Vamp#0871;29-Aug-17 09:22 AM;"Then again, I can't really blame the developers for it.";;

Vamp#0871;29-Aug-17 09:40 AM;Or you could just not use the Junction system at all.;;
Vamp#0871;29-Aug-17 09:40 AM;That's the true experience of FFVIII.;;
Chimpy#5375;29-Aug-17 09:41 AM;"Maybe, but, you could also set a hard cap as well. 50 for fire, 25 for fira, etc.";;

Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 11:27 PM;i feel like episode ardyn and episode luna will have to be more like episode prompto.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 11:27 PM;story intensive and different.;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 11:31 PM;Hot outfit?;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 11:31 PM;"And that is the one nice think about XV, fanservice.";;
monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 12:10 AM;its a double edged sword;;
monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 12:10 AM;on one hand its hot;;
monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 12:10 AM;on the other hand it's cringey and unprofessional;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:12 AM;"I'm not sure how bad it is, but I agree to an extent in that it usually is like... blunt hammer to the face.";;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:12 AM;I think you can have hot outfits without it being that direct.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:15 AM;IT's his same design without the unbuttoned shirt.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:15 AM;"There's nothing really cringey or unprofessional about it, it's whatever.";;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:15 AM;He almost does that as his original design already.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:19 AM;"Oh. Yeah, that isn't that bad. Females often get much worse.";;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:19 AM;X-2 Black Mage comes to mind.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:19 AM;X-2's black mage is fine.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:19 AM;It's Thief that can be considered a problem.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:19 AM;and Lady Luck.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:20 AM;I mean there are plenty that are blah in general. And Black Mages just feel too... hard to word.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;Busy?;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;Maybe? But I think it's just how not... robe it feels. Which bugs me.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;I just meant the only inherently fanservicey ones are Lady Luck and Thief tho tbh;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;I can see that.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;At the same time they weren't going for classic black mage robes.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;I think it's because White Mages still look like White Mages.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:24 AM;They were trying to rationalize it with Lulu's goth-belt-whatever design.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:25 AM;Like... I can see how you go from classic White Mage to what you get in X-2.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:25 AM;Black Mage not so much.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:25 AM;X-2 literally has classic WHM robes.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:25 AM;Except Paine;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:25 AM;Who manages a tunic/pants combo.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:25 AM;With Black Mage they had to respect both FFX's Black Mage and the classic Black Mge.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:26 AM;Which is why the design is kind of goth-inspired and belty while also having cap sleeves and steepled hats.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:26 AM;"Yeah. It just took me a bit to realize the issue. Oh. The special dresspheres were kind of fanservicey too. I mean, at least Full Throttle.";;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:27 AM;Full Throttle is so big that I don't really usually see Paine but I can see what you mean.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:27 AM;"The other two, especally Machina Maw, aren't fanservicey really though.";;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:28 AM;I said kind of. Was going for the skin tight suit from what I recall there. And Yuna had the exposed chest/stomach thing going on for no reason.;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:28 AM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;22-Sep-17 12:29 AM;Aesthetic™;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 12:29 AM;That's more where I was going with fanservice. But I'm probably a bit tougher on that than some.;;
monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 02:08 AM;"By fanservice in XV I was referring mostly to Cindy, who manages to elicit a cringe every time I see her";;
monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 02:09 AM;But I also just meant obvious fanservice in general;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 02:26 AM;Oh. I was meaning XV as in the main male characters.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 02:27 AM;"Like, unfortunately most female fanservice tends to be so over the top and blunt that I'd likely be extremely bothered by it even if I was the target audience.";;

monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 02:01 PM;"It looks like Lightning's main outfit will be her Lightning Returns outfit, but her moveset is all XIII?";;
monokomonoe#8934;22-Sep-17 02:02 PM;🤔;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 02:47 PM;"There are six characters next year, but there will be more. They don't know who the characters are though, I think they're trying to finalize the core roster first.";;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 02:49 PM;"Caius probably will not get in as a XIII villain, it'll be Raines instead. And Lightning/Cloud/Y'shtola have more modern outfits to represent when they come from in terms of character arcs.";;
Lto#1172;22-Sep-17 03:41 PM;"I played her in the beta, the outfit was XIII's";;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 03:42 PM;Yeah. But in story mode her default is the LR.;;
Mirron#9949;22-Sep-17 03:42 PM;"Well, story cutscenes.";;
Lto#1172;22-Sep-17 03:42 PM;"Cloud's outfit is his advent children, it seems";;
BrunoBunno#1489;22-Sep-17 03:49 PM;Kind of interesting to see Advent Children Cloud play the role instead of VII Cloud.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;22-Sep-17 03:49 PM;Maybe Dissidia NT IS connected to the previous Dissidia.;;

Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:17 PM;I guess she didn't age in valhalla;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:19 PM;"That just lists games they've appeared in. And there is still Vaan, who also isn't aged up and looking like TA2 self.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:19 PM;"The simplest answer is that Cloud, Lightning, and Y'shtola are from AC, LR, and Stormblood timeline-wise, the rest are not.";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:20 PM;Have you seen the roster image?;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:20 PM;I have.;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:21 PM;That's why I listed the roster.;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:21 PM;The ages don't line up for that to be the literal game they're from.;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:22 PM;And the costume discrepancies.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:22 PM;"Then you know it says the same thing for Kain, Golbez, and Cecil that it does for Lightning, Tidus, Cloud, and Y'shtola.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:22 PM;I know it does. But that doesn't mean they'll be treated the same.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:22 PM;Whole Vaan doesn't include the sequel.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:22 PM;While*;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:23 PM;So yeah the implication is that those three have been somehow deaged;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:24 PM;"Actually, looks like it does.";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:25 PM;Presumably these characters are meant at the end of their timelines;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:26 PM;"That... makes little sense. Being deaged wouldn't make a ton of sense. I mean I guess we will see with Yuna. But for reference in Opera Omnia Yuna is a Summoner, not a Gunner. Both in appearance and outfit. If she was going to be dressed as a Gunner in this she would probably be dressed as it in Opera Omnia.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:35 PM;Thinking on it there is Shantotto too who isn't from RoV.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:43 PM;I think a big reason I'd prefer it is that it would be more interesting if they were from the perceived ends of their timelines;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:43 PM;"Also, Yuna's default design may not mean mucj";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:44 PM;"Because what people are saying based on the demo is that Lightning, Cloud, and Y'shtola all have their original designs as their default designs";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:45 PM;"Sure, but Cecil, Kain, Golbez, and Vaan all have the original. The majority of people are still using original outfits.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:46 PM;Yuna also again is just more popular when dressed as a Summoner in general. It's the appearance she has in most crossovers.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:47 PM;My point was if she's from post x at all she'll probably be a gunner while having summoner mechanics in the story mode;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:47 PM;Like when using the gunner outfit in 012;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:48 PM;"Sure, but why would they go with her default appearance in the story being something that isn't popular and clashes with her gameplay?";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:49 PM;"It can't just be because that's how she looks like at the end of her story either, because we have examples contrary to that.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:49 PM;"Noctis also as an example, thinking on it.";;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:51 PM;"I get the example you're using, but more I'm trying to get why they would do it.";;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:07 PM;It'll be a costume if nothing else;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:07 PM;At least you have the OPTION to play as that lmao;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 01:08 PM;What do ya know? Maybe he took a shower after reuniting with his buddies;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 01:08 PM;You really think he would go take back his throne without showering?;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:21 PM;Maybe he came to like his stank;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 01:21 PM;I like his stank;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 01:21 PM;I mean what?;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:21 PM;"Tbh tho the most exciting part of that cover is that it confirms alt costumes, and not just palette swaps.";;
Malfred#1000;24-Sep-17 01:27 PM;"Whether he took a bath or not, at least bearded Noctis looks like an adult";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 03:51 PM;We already knew there were alt costumes though.;;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 04:01 PM;Yeah I've only been following it every now and again;;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 04:48 PM;They're adding story content through updates.;;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 04:49 PM;The AC crossover has already released.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:56 PM;clearly something put on the sidelines until other less important stuff is done;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:57 PM;I imagine it to be exactly like how the extended Chapter 13 thing was;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:57 PM;like 20mins of nothing;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 06:57 PM;"Yeah, whether it's good or not is another question entirely.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 06:57 PM;i was mainly answering whether it would happen.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:58 PM;I'm pretty sure they showed some scenes from it recently?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:58 PM;or atleast I saw something with Luna and Gentiana that I don't remember was in the main game;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 06:58 PM;It was probably part of the free story updates.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:58 PM;that's where it will come to then;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:58 PM;definitely will happen;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 06:59 PM;if it didn't then the survey was even more meaningless than it already feels;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 06:59 PM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:00 PM;But i mean whether we like it or not when Square has said something will happen (or will happen by a certain time) they've mostly delivered;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:00 PM;For better or worse;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:00 PM;"So Episode Ardyn, Luna, etc is as inevitable as X-3.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:00 PM;It's just a matter of time.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:03 PM;man I really don't want X-3 to happen;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:03 PM;at this point they're just milking it;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:04 PM;i want it to happen but also;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:04 PM;i'm afraid that when it does it will be bad;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:04 PM;bc it probably will;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:05 PM;though honestly it would be ideal if it had a good story and a battle system based off of FFX;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:05 PM;but maybe with a level system;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:05 PM;Honestly.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;"If it has an equal story to X, and the same battle system, I'm in.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;The story won't be equal to X;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;That's an unfair comparison to make.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;"I just need it to be as good or maybe a bit better than x-2, which was a good game _in it's own right_";;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;Yeah.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;"I wouldn't mind the Sphere Grid, though.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:06 PM;I liked it.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:08 PM;"I'd be fine with it, just adding a level system was my way of rationalizing it with X-2.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:08 PM;Either sphere grid and atb or level and turn-based.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:11 PM;what would be the point of it happening;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:11 PM;that's what I don't get;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:11 PM;I don't mind making another game with similar gameplay but seriously I don't know what else they could do;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:11 PM;unless you pull a ToD2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;or an FFIV TAY;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;It wasn't necessary before -will-;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;where it is based several years into the future;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;X-2 tied it up with a neat little bow;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;It's the same thing as XIII-2 now.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;Because whether we want to recognize it or not -will- is canon and now necessitates another game to finish off the story.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 07:12 PM;can we pretend that doesn't exist;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:13 PM;for now;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:13 PM;eventually though;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:13 PM;no we canot;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:14 PM;No matter how bad it may be.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 07:14 PM;I really don't want a X-3. And it'll probably just be an action game.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:14 PM;I'll see X end.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:14 PM;One way or another.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;24-Sep-17 07:14 PM;And then we will be able to erase everything from X-2 and forward out of our minds.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:14 PM;I don't think X-3 will be an action game;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 07:15 PM;I like X-2 myself.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 07:15 PM;"And SE is pushing action more, I only expect it to increase.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:15 PM;Maybe if turnbased combat systems or ATB systems disinterested people;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:15 PM;but;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 07:15 PM;they don't;;

Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 07:23 PM;XIII really doesn't have much in common with CoD I think. I agree with the general assessment though. SE wants to appeal to the LCD. I just think it doesn't make for better games.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 08:31 PM;The main thing is that VIIR operates under different rules than a sequel. They can reinvent whatever they want. X-3 is a sequel that would probably be styled by the base I think.;;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:23 PM;You could argue that accessories work similarly to the shields in FFX.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:23 PM;But yeah.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:23 PM;I think I'm just being so stubborn because of what an ideal would be when it comes down to it.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:24 PM;It's something dear enough to me that I _do_ have expectations even though I shouldn't.;;

Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:27 PM;It just seems really unnecessary to me. That's my big issue with the XIII sequels and the like too.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:27 PM;X-2 ended in a way that really should have wrapped things up.;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:28 PM;"I have quite a few games I want them to make ;p";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:30 PM;For all intents and purposes they were done with Spira;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:30 PM;... up until -will-;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:31 PM;"It's -will- that necessitates it and even tho many people wish it wasn't canon, it is.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:32 PM;"Sure, but they purposely added drama to create the need for a sequel.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:33 PM;I think the point was to give them reason if the remasters did well enough tbh;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:33 PM;Anyone else want type-next;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:35 PM;I do.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:35 PM;I'd like a new Type game.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:35 PM;I can't comment;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:35 PM;because I haven't played type-0;;

Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;"Sorry to disappoint everyone, but I'd take XVI instead";;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;XVI would be cool;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;was fine with Type-0;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;as long as it's not an MMO;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;wouldn't care for a sequel;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;would much prefer square to give us something new;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;once I can actually pay for the subscriptions I'll be fine with MMOs :p;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:36 PM;but that's not happening anytime soon;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:37 PM;They aren't going to give us a new mmo;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:37 PM;Not while XIV is still generating as much revenue as it is;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:37 PM;so we have to deal with them milking previously made games;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:37 PM;I wanna get XI/XIV someday;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:37 PM;All sequels SE made should never have existed in the first place;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:37 PM;"Can't say for X-2, but I heard that's the case too";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:38 PM;it is;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:38 PM;People say X-2 never should have existed based on how they feel about the story.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:38 PM;Square basically necessitated it by the way they ended X.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:38 PM;And honestly we'd have gotten TWO DIFFERENT GAMES if they didn't decide to just merge two stories so.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:38 PM;IV TAY was mostly fine just not original in any way;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;The way IV ended didn't need a sequel at all;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;Same for XIII;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;I love square enix games :p;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;IV's sequel is not placed anywhere near in the same time frame as the original game;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;Making a sequel is just pure and simple milking;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;TAY had the team-up moves to be fair.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;Otherwise I agree;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;"so they did have a chance for the sequel given the time gap between IV, Interlude, and TAY";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:39 PM;Especially with levels and level design;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:40 PM;Actually I think Interlude was an unnecessary midquel.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:40 PM;it was;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:40 PM;Good nontheless.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:40 PM;But unnecessary.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:40 PM;I think they meant to merge it with TAY;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:40 PM;it felt like the backstory for TAY that we needed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:41 PM;as you can see how it hints at the central issue that arises by the time TAY takes place;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:41 PM;Is the story over? Then it's f.ing over. Done.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:41 PM;That's not how sequels work;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;XIII certainly didn't need a sequel;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;It's also not how things work in real life.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;Is the war over? No more war;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;^;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;lol;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;TAY justifies itself by being set such a long time after the game.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;Long enough for there to be more conflict.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;That's 2 different things;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;Same idea.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:42 PM;they really do compare though;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:43 PM;All that separates them is fact v fiction.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:43 PM;when a war concludes it is over;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:43 PM;doesn't mean some idiot can't come back and stir up shit again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:43 PM;same thing goes with a game getting a sequel;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;"And with a fantasy setting it should be expected that whatever the next conflict is, years and years down the line, is fantastical.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;TAY is probably more qualified(despite being the least original) than any other sequel SE has made;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;"It's the problem, if you can call it that, with ongoing narratives.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;a lot can happen 18 years later;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;By making a sequel you are just having the risk of ruining the previous game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;getting a sequel is perfectly fine with that big of a gap;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;No you're not.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:44 PM;"Unless you can make a pretty good one, which SE clearly can't make";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;FF7 isn't ruined just because DoC exists and is a kind of... ehhhh game.;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;10-2 didn't ruin 10;;
Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;10's still a good game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;no sequel can ruin a game specifically;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;that makes no sense;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;Isn't DoC just some sort of spin-off?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;can it fuck up the lore?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;sure;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;DoC is a sequel.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:45 PM;To both FF7 and AC.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:46 PM;It's the end of the FF7 timeline until we see Nanaki with his kids.;;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:46 PM;If you treat x-2.5 as canon I can see where Marcel has a point.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:46 PM;Because it literally alters the ending of X-2.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 09:46 PM;"And seems like it's a pretty mediocre game, according to the scores";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:46 PM;So he does have a point but most sequels don't do that.;;

Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 09:48 PM;they don't have a reason to keep plugging ff12 like they do ff10 so they'll let any and all hype tza had/has die;;

Desert Stream~#1192;24-Sep-17 09:49 PM;I'll take mobile ports;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 10:03 PM;and varies depending on where you live;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 10:03 PM;It's $2.50 right now but will go down more still.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Sep-17 10:03 PM;suburb prices are lower than city prices of course;;

Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 10:04 PM;And 4 litres are $5.32 (here);;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 10:04 PM;_jesus_;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 10:04 PM;so what i take from this is all the necessary stuff in brazil is cheaper;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 10:04 PM;then frivolous stuff is more exensive.;;
Marcello#4574;24-Sep-17 10:05 PM;"Nah, everything is more expensive. A lot more";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Sep-17 07:40 PM;^;;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:10 PM;That's basically what Type-0 was.;;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:11 PM;"TPS of sorts, but still.";;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:11 PM;And they'll add more stages after release.;;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:12 PM;"Yea, we're probably getting some free character and stage updates.";;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:12 PM;Based on what they've said.;;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:12 PM;I've never heard free.;;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:13 PM;DLC we know for sure is coming.;;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:13 PM;"I mean they haven't _specified_ but the way they stated it, at least some of them are meant to be free.";;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:14 PM;Why is that?;;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:16 PM;"Mainly that they're meant to be updated to the arcade version first, and then after a month or two be _added_ to the game. They didn't say as paid content";;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:17 PM;Possibly. I guess we will see. Still the season pass.;;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:17 PM;It would be nice to silence the griping at least.;;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:19 PM;.I can see the season pass as an excuse to give people the characters immediately;;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:19 PM;"But yeah, we'll see, because it could go either way.";;
Mirron#9949;27-Sep-17 03:23 PM;Well the season passed are paid. It'll work out though.;;
Treble#5035;27-Sep-17 03:24 PM;Yeah what I meant was that you could pay for the season pass as a way to get any additional characters immediately.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:33 PM;because if you can make a shitty game sell millions in a day once;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:34 PM;part of me feels like some of XV's bad habits will rub off on it;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:35 PM;"Why stop there? Why not have thousands of DLC for it, and each costing $666!?";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:39 PM;probably;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:39 PM;but he tried to warn us;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:39 PM;and we didn't listen;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:39 PM;Any sort of big leaks tend to get caught.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:39 PM;next time it happens I probably won't even buy the game lol;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:40 PM;"And eh, I don't care about the DLC and so on, XV just isn't a good game conceptually for me. You can't add anything to it to change that. That's more what I worry about with XVI.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:41 PM;the open world thing?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:41 PM;or just how their implementation of it?;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:41 PM;Not so much any one particular element so much as the collection of elements.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:42 PM;"On a phone so can't exactly type up a list easily. I think parts of XV had promise, but everything is so interwoven you'd have to start from the ground up to get something I would like.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:42 PM;"ah, yeah I get it";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:43 PM;Note that I'll add it being good or not to me isn't the same as my considering it a bad game per say. I know others love it. For me it doesn't feel like FF.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:43 PM;"personally, I think their interpretation of an open world game was pretty bad";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:43 PM;"bad in concept, and in implementation";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:43 PM;that's why I rank it in one of the worst of its genre;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;it feels like FFXIV except;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;no major story elements;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;and you only do the side content that yields very little rewards;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;Yeah. I'm more willing to forgive good concept bad execution. Why I don't hate FFII for instance.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;FFXIV has a lot of that but I think that's just how MMOs work in general;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;and I don't think they expect you to even focus on it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:44 PM;but FFXV makes that the purpose of the game;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:45 PM;"It is. And XIV feels great, even if it has a lot of MMO feels too. Still very FF.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:45 PM;"yeah, I couldn't really finish it because I felt the story leading up to post game was a bit tedious but overall it was way more engaging";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:46 PM;even with the mountains of pointless running around;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:46 PM;"I don't get how Tabata fucked that up though, FFXII would've been a better example";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:47 PM;hell even Lightning Returns did open world better;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:47 PM;"Type-0 feels pretty good, I don't really blame Tabata.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:47 PM;and the game had like barely 10 to 15 hours of story;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:47 PM;"The problem with XV is it's a quest based RPG, when it should have been a story based RPG, like all the previous FF (minus the MMO's)";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:47 PM;"I think it's just a bunch of factors, including overhead pressure. And XI/XIV are pretty story based I feel.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;But I'm probably defining that differently than you.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;I blame him because;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;and I plan on getting it for PC;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;he had a job to do;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;and maybe to Square he succeeded;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:48 PM;game sold really well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:49 PM;but within the fanbase it is just another controversal failure;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:49 PM;"I define quest based games/RPGs as ones where you're given different quests to complete, like Borderlands, Witcher 3, Elder Scrolls, etc.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:49 PM;a game that did nothing to enrich FF as a franchise but instead make things worse than what they already were;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:49 PM;I don't think it should've been open world at all personally;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:49 PM;if they would've built it like a normal rpg;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:49 PM;So another hallway simulator?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;uh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;just because you don't use open world;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;doesn't mean you have to go directly to linearity;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;I just read the hallway simulator part;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;that's jumping from one extreme to another;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;I have absolutely no problems with a hallway game;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:50 PM;"I can't blame him when the game was likely a mess to begin with, and he had to come in and fix it as best he could.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;and I already know what game you're referencing when you made that statement too;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;I thought XIII was great personally.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;I think we all do;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;XIII is good;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;"I think you're being too harsh on 15, and it's director";;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;And so do other hallway games;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;I enjoy linear games in general;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;well you know;;
4976#3971;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;"I enjoyed XIII a lot myself, and I enjoyed XV as well, but I understand a lot of the criticism as well.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:51 PM;sometimes you have to be blunt;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;I'm not saying you can't enjoy 13;;
4976#3971;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;It definitely could have been better.;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;I mean;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;People say like being a hallways game is bad;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;"It isn't, not necessarily";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;why do people feel the need to excuse Tabata and FFXV? I never understood this;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;I'm not excusing XV.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:52 PM;regardless of what a game goes through;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:53 PM;it still has to do the job of being entertaining and fun;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 10:53 PM;^;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:53 PM;"But I also think that Type-0, again, turned out well. With one bad game and one good game, I have to decide why that is.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:53 PM;no amount of bullshit development can excuse that;;
4976#3971;29-Sep-17 10:53 PM;"I certainly won't excuse the mistakes of XV myself, but I enjoyed playing the game, so I don't criticize it too much.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:53 PM;like people try to excuse the issues the game had;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:54 PM;"The reasoning that makes the most sense is that it isn't Tabata but other factors, of which we know some.";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:54 PM;Ah. Just wanted to be sure.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:54 PM;by bringing up the game's horrible dev cycle;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:54 PM;someone has to be at fault for that;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:56 PM;"Why does one particular person have to be at fault? I don't tend to lay blame on one person, very rarely can one person make or break something. It's usually multiple factors.";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:56 PM;"He's director, not king after all.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:56 PM;doesn't have to be one person I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:57 PM;Personally I think its Tabata's fault for the way XV turned out since he had 3 years to go from nothing to something. I also think that SE in general is at fault;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:57 PM;for allowing any of this to happen;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:57 PM;I personally blame Nomura anyways since he's why Tabata had to be brought in.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:57 PM;from Versus XIII's announcement in 2006;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:58 PM;all the way up to now;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:58 PM;The higher ups in the company too.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 10:58 PM;Because a lot of things went wrong to get XV. It's a mess in general.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 10:59 PM;^ There really isn't a good reason to dump every thing that went wrong on one person;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 10:59 PM;"yes it is, which is why I criticise it the way I do";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:00 PM;I don't think I've seen many unreasonable criticisms either;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 11:00 PM;So I can blame everything wrong with the world on you;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:00 PM;Aren't they announcing new cutscenes or story stuff? (no spoilerinos pls);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:00 PM;Psychotic I wasn't directing that to you lol;;

Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:02 PM;I think the big issue is post X in general things have been kind of a mess with the main games. Maybe fair to say post XI.;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:02 PM;The mess was already made or it sucks?;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:02 PM;"XII, XIII, XIV, and XV have all had major development issues to varying degrees.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;"I'll say this: 15 has issues, but it isn't a bad game, and far from the worst FF";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;Square became obsessed with staying relevant;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;is my guess;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;"XIV I guess was more the head guy didn't want to listen to anyone, 1.0 I think can be safely blamed on one person.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;I've noticed that too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;XIII's development was gimped because of Crystal Tools;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;"I would say XV is a bad FF, even if it isn't a bad game.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;which turned out to be a horrible engine anyway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;and gimped XIV 1.0;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:03 PM;along with other issues that game already had;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:05 PM;"XIV 1.0 may have had engine issues, but most of it I feel was the director sticking to his vision and ignoring feedback.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:05 PM;"but yeah, SE is trying to stay with the cool kids they to the point where it seems like with every game they forget what made FF great in the first place";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:05 PM;"Sticking to a vision is good, but not to the point of tunnel vision.";;

Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:07 PM;"The costs of making the kind of top of the line game is raising, meaning to meet the kind of profits they want they have to appeal to a broader and broader audience.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:07 PM;if they would've changed the name to remove Final Fantasy from the title;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:07 PM;it probably wouldn't even remind you of FF;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:08 PM;"I feel like lowering the cutting edge aspect with graphics especially would be fine. There are other issues with XV beyond that, like I hate fantasy based on reality as an idea, but could be salvaged maybe.";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:08 PM;Dimensions feels like an FF. It's not top of the line.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:09 PM;"WoFF does too. Pushes some things a bit, but not as much as XV in my opinion.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:09 PM;I love WoFF mainly because of the time it was developed in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:09 PM;like we needed a game like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:09 PM;or atleast I did;;
4976#3971;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;My biggest problem with XV is probably the world. It just doesn't feel like a fantasy world to me.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;It wasn't perfect by any means;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;"but damn, sucks that it got overshadowed by XV";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;"WoFF has flaws, yeah. Every FF does. And I agree.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;only for XV to end up being worse;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;"They dumped so much advertising into XV, barely saw anything of WoFF.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:10 PM;I didn't even know about WoFF's existence until the damn demo of the game released;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:11 PM;"And it's a great game, lots of potential for a sequel too. But I don't know if it'll happen.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:11 PM;pmuch;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:11 PM;"```, My biggest problem with XV is probably the world. It just doesn't feel like a fantasy world to me., ```, oh yeah, this is the biggest disconnection to FF for me";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:11 PM;it's just open;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;nothingness;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;I think he meant more my issue with it.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;Namely it's too tied to real life.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;oh;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;Cup of Noodles for crying out loud.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;I thought he meant how uninspiring the actual design of the world was;;
4976#3971;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;That's one of the things I love about 13 and 14. The worlds are great and feel like a fantasy world to me.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:12 PM;I will never get over that really. I don't think so at least.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:13 PM;"I loved Cocoon, Pulse and all of the iterations of Nova Crystallia from the first game to the third";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;Eorza is pretty nice too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;feels alive;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;when you travel;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;and then you play XV;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;To be honest;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;and it's like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;"this dead world, barely any people";;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;And let me be very clear this is just my opinion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;millions of gas stations;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;no towns;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:14 PM;It became cool to hate XIII;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;"Or the XIII trilogy, actually";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;ok maybe 2 major cities;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;it did;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;but you have to realize that;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;I never hated XIII.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;it was always like that for XIII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;the game got slammed on release;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;similar to how XV was;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;"I love some of the mechanical features, they're key in my theoretical FF game design.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;still sold well;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:15 PM;XIII got some hard shit on the release and it perpetuated;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;I have no idea why;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;that's how hate works;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;I feel XIII people were harder on.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;XV people were too hyped on at first to bash it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;^;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;XIII got some very unfair shit;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;It was the game that was going to save FF.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;With ten years of that focus.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;^this mindset also stems from XIII's hate;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;Way back when all we had was that little trailer.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:16 PM;Yeah.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:17 PM;saving FF that's stuff that came into existence because of XIII imo;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:17 PM;probably my biggest pet peeve so far;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:17 PM;was the press X to win meme;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:17 PM;all because the game had auto battle as an option;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:18 PM;yet when XV comes out and literally implements combat in which you can do a full combo;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:18 PM;I think it happened with XII a bit too.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:18 PM;by holding the button;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:18 PM;Not as much.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:18 PM;and nobody has a problem with this;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:18 PM;But XII was a sizeable departure too. And XI/XIV were MMOs.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:19 PM;oh yeah XII got a lot shit because of gambits too iirc;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:19 PM;Granted they all feel more like FF than XV to me.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:19 PM;tbh gambits was another dumb complaint like the auto battle option in XIII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:19 PM;no one is going to realistically turn it off for all characters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:19 PM;and control them manually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:20 PM;"and if you didn't like it on the character you controlled, you didn't have to use it at all";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:20 PM;I did that.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:20 PM;and it wouldn't even hinder the game from not doing so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;I think they added it for the character you control as just another option for freedom of customization or ease of access;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;I wish XIII had an option to control all three. But I agree. And auto battle wasn't always the best.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;"Well, I think it's also necessary for Yiazmat.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;anytime you had to debuff in XIII;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;It's possible to beat XIII just with autobattle;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;auto battle was not a good solution;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;Very possible;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:21 PM;But not using the same paradigms;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:22 PM;it is possible;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:22 PM;doesn't mean you have to;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:22 PM;doesn't mean you are forced to;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:22 PM;I'm just saying because it's almost a legit complaint;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:22 PM;Though when people say it's press x to win I believe they never thought about the paradigm system;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:23 PM;it was a meme;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:23 PM;that's all it was;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:23 PM;Like you could beat the game without even changing a paradigm in-battle;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:23 PM;then people starting hoping on the bandwagon;;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:23 PM;People still saying that just for the sake of hating the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:23 PM;and trying to use it as a legitimate issue;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;man I used to hate when XIII was in its prime;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;dark days;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;I did too.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;you think liking XV is hard;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;And I'm still sad the main villain isn't liked at all.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;He's one of my favorites.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:24 PM;dude you couldn't even mention XIII without creating a big ass argument;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:25 PM;damn dude;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:26 PM;It sucks. XIII is still pretty hated. XV doesn't get nearly as much flack. It never will.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:26 PM;I've seen it with how people react to the dlc they keep dumping in the game;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:27 PM;the fans of the game will be lined up and in position to defend it with their life;;

Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:28 PM;I think a lot of the time people are too harsh. Butt then people are too soft too.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:28 PM;Autocorrect why?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:28 PM;lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:28 PM;yeah there are sometimes where it can go too far;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:28 PM;I think it was worse at the start;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:28 PM;"My phone, seriously. It's hard to get a happy medium with criticism.";;
Marcello#4574;29-Sep-17 11:29 PM;It means you use the word Butt way too much;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:29 PM;which made me think XV was going to end up like XIII;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:29 PM;and the more tabata dumped shit into the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:29 PM;the more forgiving the fans became;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:29 PM;idk;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:29 PM;Even the best games have flaws. And even the worst usually have some good areas.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:30 PM;"And also, this is important, what you like and dislike is not the same thing as a universal flaw or the like.";;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:30 PM;"Huge, huge thing to keep in mind. Too many people take their opinion as having to mean it's broken or great.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:31 PM;vs what actually happened;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:32 PM;Yeah. It's also why concept vs execution is big for me.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:32 PM;But sometimes a game just isn't designed for you. Not every game can be.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:32 PM;Nor should be really.;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:33 PM;"I'm just upset with XV because almost every part FF I was part of the audience. Now I'm out, at the very least.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:34 PM;then realized what I was playing wasn't even the game I thought I was buying;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:35 PM;"I thankfully didn't have that happen. But XV just didn't appeal to me even early on, and sadly just got worse as more details got solidified.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:36 PM;was so hyped I bought the game a week before it was delayed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;29-Sep-17 11:36 PM;if that wasn't the biggest kick in the nuts idk what is;;
Mirron#9949;29-Sep-17 11:37 PM;Lol. That definitely didn't happen. I was super hyped for WoFF though. Sadly both it and Explorers didn't do as well as I hoped.;;

Desert Stream~#1192;11-Oct-17 07:07 PM;oh wait;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Oct-17 07:08 PM;yes they did;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Oct-17 07:09 PM;the only main FF title on PS3 is FFXIII and its sequels;;
Desert Stream~#1192;11-Oct-17 07:09 PM;ye I count the sequels;;
Desert Stream~#1192;11-Oct-17 07:09 PM;and I don't count the MMOs :p;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Oct-17 07:09 PM;oh yeah I forgot about XIV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Oct-17 07:10 PM;XIV is still a main title so I say it does count;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Oct-17 07:10 PM;just as XI counted;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;11-Oct-17 07:11 PM;So it's 2 or 4 on PS3.;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;11-Oct-17 07:11 PM;11 was on PS2.;;
Desert Stream~#1192;11-Oct-17 07:11 PM;they're still main series tho;;

Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 01:18 PM;I think giving him that protagonism is fine.;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 01:19 PM;He's _the_ original protagonist and in the original Dissidia if any singular main character had to be picked it'd be WOL.;;

Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:00 PM;"Actually no, not according to the wiki.";;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:00 PM;It was a full change.;;

Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:00 PM;it's not sourced but that's also what i remember.;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:00 PM;"To overcome the pain of her parents' deaths and to become an adult as quickly as possible, she changed her name from Claire Farron to Lightning.";;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:01 PM;"My parents died. I had to be strong for Serah, so I thought I needed to forget my past. And I became Lightning. I thought by changing my name, I could change who I was. I was younger then. You can't run away from yourself. Serah tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen.";;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:01 PM;This is the exact quote from the game.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:01 PM;and the wiki has no source to fact check that she truly did that (even though the games has referenced her as Claire before);;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:01 PM;"So, yeah, she changed her name.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:02 PM;that's not really changing your name though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:02 PM;my interpretation of that has always been that she was just pretending to be someone else in order to hide the pain;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:02 PM;I mean she _says_ she changes her name so we have to assume that since she's not Claire Lightning Farron that it was also legal.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:02 PM;makes even more sense in LR;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:02 PM;The only person that even calls her Claire iirc is Serah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:03 PM;It didn't say it was legal so there's no reason to assume it wasn't just another persona of the same person;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:04 PM;because if it was legal I'm pretty sure it would've atleast been Lightning Farron;;

Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:04 PM;"I think that actually _is_ her legal name, Lightning Farron.";;

Marcello#4574;17-Oct-17 02:05 PM;I don't think 'legal names' were ever a thing in gaming history though.;;
Marcello#4574;17-Oct-17 02:06 PM;We can just assume Lightning adopted the Lightning name and that's it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:06 PM;I've never heard of a situation where a character changed their legal name in a videogame;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:06 PM;like I view her calling herself Lightning in a similar way that Garnet wanted a different name in IX;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:07 PM;I'm not really going to argue about it because in the long run it doesn't really... matter I guess? It's all up to interpretation.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:07 PM;she isn't legally Dagger;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Oct-17 02:07 PM;but the cast refers to her as that because it is her nickname;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:07 PM;With Garnet you can argue that it goes even further though.;;
Treble#5035;17-Oct-17 02:07 PM;It's kind of messy.;;

Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:09 PM;apparently the only one inherently good is LR;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:09 PM;but i haven't played them;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:09 PM;"i know that xiii is only fixable by mods and xiii-2 too, but even _more_ mods.";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:10 PM;when i tried to replay xiii-2 on my laptop the framerate and voice track were way out of sync.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:10 PM;nor fixable;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:10 PM;and it wasn't my computer.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:10 PM;LR runs the best because it was the most updated version of the engine;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:10 PM;when it comes down to it crystal dynamics just wasn't a good fit for computers.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:11 PM;and the ports didn't help any.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:11 PM;"XIII and XIII-2 are just a mess, and this is something that has plagued Crystal Tools since XIV 1.0";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:11 PM;which had the same complaints that we saw with the ports of XIII and co;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:11 PM;"CT just sucks, hardcoded to run at 30fps and within the constraints of the PS3 and 360";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;i think it's important to note that woff doesn't run in crystal tools though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;and again the ports of x and ix are _great_;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;">Crystal Tools, , You know, Deus Ex: Human Revolution ran just fine on the same engine";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;so there's at least a 50/50 chance;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 02:12 PM;like being able to have quality settings higher than the PS4 version;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Nov-17 02:13 PM;"I remember listening to the developer commentary of the DLC for Deus Ex: Human Revolution on how they were still learning the Crystal Dynamics engine while making the game, and that they took what they learned while making the game to make the DLC";;

Davkilla101#0932;02-Nov-17 02:15 PM;"Ah, well, let me see if I can look up which engine they used";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:15 PM;Isn't Crystal Dynamics just the subsidiary?;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:15 PM;Or team;;
Davkilla101#0932;02-Nov-17 02:15 PM;Because now I'm confused on what they used;;

Davkilla101#0932;02-Nov-17 02:16 PM;That's probably why it ran so good;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;27-Nov-17 06:31 PM;Exactly;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;27-Nov-17 06:31 PM;That's what they want you to think;;
Marcello#4574;27-Nov-17 06:34 PM;inb4 VIII-2;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Nov-17 06:40 PM;I wouldn't mind a VIII-2;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Nov-17 06:41 PM;I consider FF8 to be an acquired taste.;;
Marcello#4574;27-Nov-17 06:41 PM;I'm not sure if I should get back to VIII after I'm done with XV or IX;;
Marcello#4574;27-Nov-17 06:42 PM;"Maybe after IX, because I was too lazy at the time to mod VIII";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;27-Nov-17 06:50 PM;but that would be cool;;

action warrior#8892;27-Nov-17 09:22 PM;I would love a sequel to 8;;
action warrior#8892;27-Nov-17 09:23 PM;But with a new cast;;
action warrior#8892;27-Nov-17 09:24 PM;Tbh i could get with a sequel to any of the ps1 era games but it should be like force awakens focusing on a new cast but the older characters play a role too;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;27-Nov-17 09:28 PM;I'm not a fan of TNG -ing stuff;;
action warrior#8892;27-Nov-17 09:35 PM;Just feel like i've seen enough of those characters;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;27-Nov-17 09:41 PM;An VIII game with Laguna and crew would be good;;
Treble#5035;27-Nov-17 09:44 PM;Low-key working on a ff8-2 fanfic;;
action warrior#8892;28-Nov-17 12:05 AM;@Doctor_Vile#6548 would rather have a fully fleshed out Laguna thing in an 8 remake;;
action warrior#8892;28-Nov-17 12:05 AM;Basically what we got in the original version but more of it would be enough for me;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Nov-17 08:35 AM;Star Ocean on SNES was really impressive for its time.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Nov-17 08:38 AM;"Both Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean stretched the power of the Super Famicom to its limits, with a total of 48 megabits of data. Additionally, Star Ocean was also one of two games that used a special S-DD1 chip to aid in compression of almost all graphics and map data, meaning that it effectively stored even more data than Tales of Phantasia";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:14 AM;yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh they just used 2017 as bait for finishing the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:14 AM;though we already knew this I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:15 AM;"still, I saw Ignis doing shit in the trailer I had never seen him do in the game ever";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:15 AM;I believe he was even warping similar to Noctis?;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:15 AM;I actually find it extremely unlikely that the primary DLC's for XV won't be character focuses outside of two of them tbh.;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:15 AM;Episode Ardyn and Episode Luna were obvious and have been ever since the poll they did.;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:16 AM;But I lowkey expect to see more than that.;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:16 AM;Like say Episode Aranea.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:16 AM;The funny part about all of this is that I remember long ago close to when the game was still new;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:17 AM;Tabby did an interview in which he was asked about all of the fan criticism and he made it seem as if how the game turned out was how he originally wanted it to be;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:18 AM;That just adds insult to injury if you ask me;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:18 AM;we basically played the beta version for $60;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:18 AM;or that's how I'm seeing it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:19 AM;if he's going completely against his word and vision;;

Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:21 AM;They've literally changed gameplay dynamics fundamentally _and_ added story content that wasn't DLC.;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:22 AM;So it's literally already not the same game that you bought at launch.;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:22 AM;That's why I didn't start looking into it until now.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:22 AM;I mean besides how the other 3 characters play;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:22 AM;has the gameplay really changed that much?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:22 AM;like is item spamming still a thing?;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:23 AM;etc...;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:23 AM;the thing is that the other four characters being able to be party lead is enough from what people have told me;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 01:24 AM;each other bro plays significantly different from noctis;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:24 AM;I suppose;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:24 AM;"I mean shit, Ignis was doing moves I have never seen him use ever";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:25 AM;for a split second he actually looks like he could be more than just regroup tech spam;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:26 AM;I'm certainly not paying for this extra shit they're dumping into the game if those 4chan leaks turn out to be true(I have no reason to doubt them right now) since that's content that should've been in the game in the first place;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-17 01:27 AM;if some it is free then maybe I'll give the game another go just to see what's different;;

Treble#5035;11-Dec-17 12:37 PM;I don't really do online fighting a lot anyway so it's not a deal breaker for me.;;

Treble#5035;11-Dec-17 12:43 PM;Yes there is?;;

Treble#5035;11-Dec-17 12:45 PM;I think a non-linear story mode would be better.;;
Treble#5035;11-Dec-17 12:46 PM;Or like a arcade mode like Tekken 5.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Dec-17 12:46 PM;I assume that one of the offline modes will be an arcade ladder of some sort;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Dec-17 01:50 PM;can beat the whole game by spamming one attack because it is so OP;;

Treble#5035;26-Dec-17 04:56 PM;just realized i need to get the digital deluxe edition for dissidia nt.;;
Treble#5035;26-Dec-17 04:56 PM;... oh well.;;
Treble#5035;26-Dec-17 04:58 PM;"Access to six characters not in the base game, along with their default weapons and costumes, Two color variations of each of those characters’ default costumes";;
Treble#5035;26-Dec-17 04:59 PM;does this mean we'll have to buy the actual alt costumes separately?;;

Aura#2896;26-Dec-17 04:59 PM;What the actual hell. At least the first alt outfits were in the base game in dissidia and 012;;
Treble#5035;26-Dec-17 05:00 PM;We get the alts for the base game characters.;;
Treble#5035;26-Dec-17 05:00 PM;It's the other six that bother me.;;

Desert Stream~#1192;02-Jan-18 06:46 PM;So who here thinks that FFXVI even has a basic story concept yet;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;02-Jan-18 07:04 PM;i doubt theres anything really tangible yet brother;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;02-Jan-18 07:04 PM;/sister;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;02-Jan-18 07:04 PM;would it be safe to assume that they probably dont want to have too many eggs ina  single basket until after the FF7 remake and Dissidia NT?;;

🏮𝓢𝓽𝓪𝓻𝓵𝓲𝓰𝓱𝓽🏮#5335;08-Jan-18 01:37 AM;I think FF7 Remake is closer along then square leads us to believe.;;

Marcello#4574;08-Jan-18 01:53 AM;Who said FF VIIR isn't going to be bad? :^);;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 02:18 AM;True. Theres always a chance it will mediocre.;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 02:18 AM;I found FFXV to be mediocre so theres a chance i might feel the same about FFVIIR;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 02:19 AM;"I think though, if they stick to what made FFVII great in the first place, which was telling a good story with good characters, instead of trying too hard to be like other open world games and losing what made FF great in the first place like they did with FFXV, it will be fine";;
PikSylBits#6260;08-Jan-18 02:23 AM;True that;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;08-Jan-18 11:49 AM;"Nice nombre, Mikasa 👍";;
Marcello#4574;08-Jan-18 01:52 PM;inb4 people say FFVII was always trash in any aspect;;
Marcello#4574;08-Jan-18 01:52 PM;(I personally love it);;
Malfred#1000;08-Jan-18 02:07 PM;"I like the game, and it was fantastic for its time, and held up extremely well for many years";;
Malfred#1000;08-Jan-18 02:08 PM;But it isn't as if newer games haven't outdone it in just about every sense.;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 03:32 PM;FF7 has aged pretty well but i will agree some other RPGs have surpassed it;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 03:33 PM;but im sure FF7R will recapture what made it special and enhanced it even more for the modern time;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 03:33 PM;as long as they don't lose their way like with XV;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:11 PM;@Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702 i think based on their track record;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:12 PM;this kind of over zealous expectation is most FF7 fans bane;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:12 PM;"its going to do what Disney did with Star Wars, reboot and try to capture a new generation/demographic";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:13 PM;"and while i dont fault them for this, as it is essential to stay valid";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:13 PM;but it will most likely alienate may of the fans who hold FF7 in especially close regard;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:14 PM;and as it comes to closer to actually being real and playable i expect in my specific scenario i will end up voting with me wallet;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;08-Jan-18 07:14 PM;and not buy it;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 08:26 PM;ill hold off on buying it;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 08:26 PM;ill see what the community thinks of it before getting it;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 08:26 PM;and looking at reviews of course;;
Billie the Kid (¬‿¬)#2702;08-Jan-18 08:26 PM;ive stopped buying games full price at release;;

Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:13 AM;As a note it's kind of exhausting that whenever VIIR is mentioned someone brings up the idea that it's going to be bad.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:13 AM;We know nothing about the game.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:13 AM;Just don't talk about if that's all you're going to add lol.;;
Malfred#1000;09-Jan-18 07:19 AM;I think that is mostly a case of FF fans not trusting modern SE with handling Squaresoft goodness.;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 07:31 AM;^;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 07:32 AM;I don't trust SE to make justice to the original game;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 07:33 AM;And definitely not with this episodic thing just to milk the game;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Jan-18 11:57 AM;"From what I've seen, it's because they hate change and so any change automatically means it's bad.";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:08 PM;ive tried to stay very middle of the road;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:08 PM;if ive misrepresented that here previously my bad;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:09 PM;"but i think @Marcello#4574 said it best for me, i dont really trust them to do a remake justice. That isnt to say that they dont know what they have; quite to the contrary";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:09 PM;they just havent shown in recent years that they can properyly meet the rather consistent wants and desires of their hardcore fans;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:10 PM;i know its naive to say that there is even a game that can come out that everyone just goes Wow this is fucking amazing no complains;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:10 PM;i know thats a pipe dream;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:11 PM;but i do think that they have gone down a road in their creative direction and how their games operate that when applied to FF7;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:11 PM;is going to be incredibly devisive;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:12 PM;"and the last thing i will say is that it *IS* possible to do a remake and not have in it in what they have showcased as real-time, keep it episodic, and still meet what most FF& fans would call a worthy heir";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:12 PM;the people who could do that arent because there IS a tad of creative bankrupcy both here and overseas;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:13 PM;in certain brands;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 01:13 PM;❤ i love you all;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 03:30 PM;"I think a lot of it comes down to people making vii out to be better than it actually is. Which, mind you, it is a good game, but it's not the holy Grail of gaming. I think as it is it would be best just to let them do their thing for now and, later, if it's bad it's bad. But right now we know a handful of things about it., , It is a remake of FFVII. It is directed by Tetsuya Nomura. The battle style appears similar to Kingdom Hearts. You can change the party leader. It will be more than one full length (NOT EPISODIC) game. In game one you should be able to fully explore Midgar.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:36 PM;My main issue with it is that it is just going to drag on for far too long;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:36 PM;and I'm mostly speaking on the amount of time we have to wait for every piece to release;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:37 PM;I remember them mentioning it will be episodic in a sense that it would be the same length as XIII and its sequels;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:38 PM;but even the development period of all 3 combined;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:38 PM;was from 06 - 2013;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:38 PM;I would much prefer if they just called it a reimagination of VII or even a reboot;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:38 PM;and each sequel was progressively shorter;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:38 PM;"Also, this multiple games can't fool anyone";;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:39 PM;It doesn't even make sense;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:39 PM;and they're thinking of making 3 full length games in order to tell a story that originally took 1 game to tell;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:39 PM;Yep;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:39 PM;"afaik, that's not even VII anymore";;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:40 PM;They are going to scrap most of it and make a reboot instead;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:40 PM;you'd be best worrying about the amount of padding that will be introduced in order to get three 40hr games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:40 PM;or however many parts they intend on making;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:40 PM;this isn't factoring in Crisis Core's story;;

Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:41 PM;For how long we were supposed to have a VIIR in the first place?;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:41 PM;It's like they have no idea on how do deal with it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:41 PM;never;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;up until 2014;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;when it was announced;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;I can see something like XV happening again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;previously they denied ever wanting to do it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;especially back when they made a PS3 tech demo of the opening scene years ago;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;granted;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;all Square did at that time was show off graphics;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:42 PM;VII's Tech Demo;;

Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:44 PM;"Still, I wouldn't be surprised if they were already planning on doing it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:44 PM;probably some time before the official announcement;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:44 PM;but not that far back;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:44 PM;I'm more concerned that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:45 PM;they had to switch to in house development;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:45 PM;and why was it being outsourced in the first place;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:45 PM;Give it to Platinum and Yoko Taro;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:45 PM;"I wouldn't mind that, to be honest lol";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:46 PM;(but then the PC version will be broken and they will lie about fixing it);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:46 PM;but yeah I wouldn't mind that;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:46 PM;Well;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:46 PM;It would be on UE4;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:46 PM;So it would be harder to break;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:46 PM;never underestimate stupidity;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:47 PM;those are using UE4 and they seem to work reasonably;;

Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:52 PM;The good thing about it is that something better might come off from it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:52 PM;True;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:53 PM;I definitely appreciate it in games like horizon because I know that it likely would not look as good or perform as well (as to be expected from a console) on anything else. Maybe UE4.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:53 PM;oh yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Jan-18 03:53 PM;Death Stranding is using too I think;;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:55 PM;"Yep, it is";;
Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:55 PM;Though I must say UE4 usually has that unique style;;

Marcello#4574;09-Jan-18 03:56 PM;TAA;;

Marcello#4574;10-Jan-18 10:15 AM;Welp;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jan-18 10:16 AM;> revealing season pass content even before the game launch;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jan-18 10:16 AM;This is just disgusting to me;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 10:38 AM;Bit sad that none of the males are returning characters;;

Lto#1172;10-Jan-18 11:12 AM;prische isnt already there?;;
Lto#1172;10-Jan-18 11:12 AM;"My predictions:, - Balthier, , - one dude from  VI,, - Fang, , - Ardyn,, - Yuna,, -  Auron.";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:16 AM;The first DLC character will be a villain;;
Lto#1172;10-Jan-18 11:17 AM;Ardyn;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:17 AM;I doubt that'll happen unless Episode Ardyn becomes a thing;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:17 AM;I thought they already confirmed Episode Ardyn;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:18 AM;They have?;;
Lto#1172;10-Jan-18 11:18 AM;"there should be a villain and a hero for every mainline FF, non mmo, so Ardyn is most likely a lock";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:18 AM;I thought they said they were interested;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:18 AM;I don't doubt Ardyn getting in;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:18 AM;Eventually;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:19 AM;http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/29/final-fantasy-xv-getting-least-three-dlc-episodes-2018-starting-episode-ardyn/;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:19 AM;I doubt he'll be the first DLC char though;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:19 AM;Huh;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:19 AM;Well I stand corrected;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:20 AM;I do agree that they'll probably wait for this to release before they drop Ardyn into Dissidia tho;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:20 AM;I think first DLC character will be either XII or XIII villain rep;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:20 AM;So;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:20 AM;Caius;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:20 AM;possibly;;
Lto#1172;10-Jan-18 11:21 AM;Caius would be a fine addition;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:21 AM;"they do specify numbered Final Fantasy titles in that list, so I wonder if they include the sequels in that";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:22 AM;I think at least with XIII all of them count as XIII in this case;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:34 AM;"First DLC will either be Vayne, Gaius, or Ardyn";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:34 AM;I don't think they'll go with Caius;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:35 AM;Square likes to pretend he doesn't exist;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:35 AM;I guess Cid Raines is another possibility for XIII;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:35 AM;"A lame choice, but a valid one.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:36 AM;It seems like Cid is the more likely candidate for a XIII villain which is lame because Caius is better and Cid isn't a villain;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:37 AM;I don't think Cid has enough star power for their first character. I think they'll wanna go with someone big.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:37 AM;He can play nice alongside Jecht and Golbez then;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:37 AM;A newcomer villain with oomph from VIII - XV?;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:38 AM;"Necron, clearly";;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:38 AM;Seymour maybe? But they're also probably bringing back Yuna and it'd be weird to have two characters from one game in a season pass.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:38 AM;I'd be more partial to Prishe;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:39 AM;Mostly due to her filling up the brawler/fist-fighter role;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:39 AM;"I'd also prefer Prishe, but I can't see them bringing her back over Yuna.";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:39 AM;Which is currently missing;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:39 AM;They specifically said they weren't bringing new VII characters in because there's already 3 VII characters in Dissidia;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:39 AM;So it's doubtful well get another X rep;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:39 AM;At least not until every other game has 3 reps;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:40 AM;"As I recall, Vayne's popularity in Japan is pretty much nil";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:40 AM;So I can't imagine him being their first choice;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:41 AM;"I was gonna say Seifer, but I forgot Laguna's already planned for VIII's eventual third";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:42 AM;And they showed off Hyperion as an alternate weapon for Squall;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:42 AM;Which makes it even more unlikely;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:42 AM;It's most likely gonna be Ardyn;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:42 AM;Inb4 Eald'narche;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:43 AM;Inb4 Garland from IX curveball;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:43 AM;xD;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:43 AM;Or... Zorn/Thorn?  Not many other male villains in IX;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:44 AM;Amarant maybe;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:44 AM;Can't really call him a villain;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:44 AM;"Even if he starts out slightly antagonistic, that barely lasts for one battle";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:44 AM;I'm telling you;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:44 AM;Necron;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:44 AM;"technically, all Nomura said was the first character is a bad guy. Amarant is bad, but not in a villainous sense, so maybe he still works";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:45 AM;Fair point;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:45 AM;Amarant as IX's 3rd rep would literally be the worst thing;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:45 AM;Beatrix would work;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:45 AM;beatrix would be amazin;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:45 AM;"Over Steiner, Beatrix, and Vivi?";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:45 AM;Would be nice to see her get some deserved recognition;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;We should start a Beatrix for NT campaign;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;SE never really listens to those;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;Unless its japanese;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;Beatrix would be my choice for IX but Vivi will probably get it because he's the best boy;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;But you see;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;That doesn't matter;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:46 AM;They still don't listen anyhow? xD;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:47 AM;That too;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:47 AM;The listing was 1 from first half of FF and everything else from second half. But where does the half actually land?;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:48 AM;8?;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:48 AM;1-7;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:48 AM;8-15;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:48 AM;1st half character is someone from VI;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:48 AM;"I think it's Locke, based on his appearance in that audio drama thing";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:49 AM;IV and V have 3 reps already and 1-3 don't have characters;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:49 AM;And that he was the originally planned one before Terra;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:49 AM;4 has 3 characters already and getting more than 2 characters out of 1-3 is.. Hard.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:49 AM;"That includes obvious choices, such as Minwu";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:49 AM;"Well II does but why put Leon, Ricard, Minwu, or Guy in over someone from VI?";;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;appease the beaver audience with Guy;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;"Right, gotta make sure the beavers buy the game";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;"5 also has 3, now that I think about it";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;"Faris would be nice, imo";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;"I mentioned it earlier, but I really wanted Gilgamesh to return early on";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:50 AM;Sad days;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:51 AM;Ah well.. He'll return eventually;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:51 AM;Please look forward to it on Dissida NT  final remix;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:52 AM;...;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:52 AM;Plis no;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:54 AM;You know it has a high chance of happening. After like 91803280938 character season passes;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:54 AM;As a fighting game enthusiast;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:54 AM;I sincerely doubt this game will have as significant a staying power as SE seems to think it will;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:55 AM;It's a bad fighting game and it's coming out literally within days of DragonBall FighterZ;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:55 AM;That's usually SE's train of thought. Overestimating their market reach;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;"And yeah, DBFZ rules the hype train";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;Even worse;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;NT is a fan service game and that's all;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;SFV:AE -and- DBFZ;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;it's not even good fan service 'cause there's no Celes;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;And both release a week before NT;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:56 AM;They're trying to include actual characters and not Mary Sues;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:57 AM;So no Celes;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:57 AM;Oh damn;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:57 AM;:kefkalaugh:;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:57 AM;why do you want to hurt me;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:57 AM;Reasons;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:57 AM;I enjoy the suffering of others;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:58 AM;It fuels my power.;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 11:58 AM;is that why you keep telling people to play VIII;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:58 AM;"From 9, I'd really like to see Beatrix or Freya, even though I know it'll be Vivi or Garnet";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 11:59 AM;Steiner I think would be more likely than Garnet.  But it doesn't matter.  Vivi will win.  Vivi always wins;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 11:59 AM;The first rule about VIII is we don't talk about VIII;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:00 PM;I tall about VIII all the time.  It's my favorite.;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:00 PM;You tall?;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:00 PM;I would add 2 more characters from VIII if I had the power;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:00 PM;I'm average height.;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:00 PM;Who? Fujin and Raijin?;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:01 PM;That's about the only ones worth a slot;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:01 PM;Seifer and Rinoa;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:01 PM;"Seifer shined more bullying Zell than his interactions with Squall, imo";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:02 PM;And Rinoa... :shrugs:;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 12:02 PM;put the dog in Dissidia;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:02 PM;Angelo is the GOAT from VIII;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:02 PM;@Leon#9542 knows wassup;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:03 PM;Rinoa's playstyle would involve the dog.  It would be amazing.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:03 PM;There's not enough dogs in Dissidia.;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 12:04 PM;which is the game's main problem and why I'm not buying it;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:04 PM;I thought the issue was a lack of Celes.;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;this too;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;the game has a lot of problems;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;The biggest problem is the lack of Genesis.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;He's the best FF character.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;Nah man;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;"yes, we need Gackt";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:05 PM;"Yeah, the whole bs that the console version is a prologue of the arcade version is ugh";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:06 PM;The biggest issue is that every character isn't Bartz;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:06 PM;*butz;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:06 PM;Bartz;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:06 PM;Butz;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Jan-18 12:06 PM;The biggest issue is there's no pony skins;;

Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;XIII's villain will be the Hallway.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;Shiiit;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;It just makes the fight so unfun that the other player quits.;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;Hahahaha;;
Leon#9542;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;"clearly the guest spot belongs to the Flanitor, the best XIII character http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Flanitor_(Final_Fantasy_XIII)";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:08 PM;Honestly.. That'd be rather cool;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:09 PM;Having a gimmick character that was the stage itself;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:09 PM;Would help with the refunds for the people who do buy it;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:10 PM;Flanitors were one of the few good mob designs from XIII;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Jan-18 12:11 PM;"Before you can play on any of the XIII stages, you would have to read an encyclopedia";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:11 PM;That's not as painful as the pony skins;;

Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:14 PM;that's what she said;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Jan-18 12:14 PM;How about you had to read it *every time*?;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:14 PM;Although being a librarian.. I guess I'll be cheating a bit.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:14 PM;Still preferable to pony skins;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:15 PM;pony skins are sacrilege;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:15 PM;We forgot the possibility of a XIV villain;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:16 PM;hmm;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:17 PM;I know Yoshi-P mentioned that he'd prefer Nael Van Darnus or Zenos Yae Galvus;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:17 PM;"Idk, Zenos was quite on the evil/bad side but he, like most of the evils are shooting stars";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:17 PM;Personally I'd prefer Gaius van Baelsar;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:17 PM;"Agreed, though he never really struck me as evil nor bad";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:18 PM;"Gaius was the ruler that Eorzea needed, but didn't deserve";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:19 PM;"Instead they are stuck with useless royalty, tree huggers and a pirate guild that is busy doing everything that pirates don't do";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:19 PM;Gaius is the only villain from XIV that I know;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Jan-18 12:19 PM;So he gets my vote.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:19 PM;Hey now;;

Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:21 PM;Doesn't take away that it's still failstrom. specially with the freelance thing in pvp;;

Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:22 PM;fair enough;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:22 PM;failstrom it is;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:24 PM;Lahabrea would be a possibility I guess;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:25 PM;"He did stay a villain across ARR and HW, even if his role in the latter was rather short.";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:27 PM;"I mean the Ascians are the true villains considering their consistency, but like you say, their role has been small in the expansions and there's not been an active opposing character to WoL in XIV";;

Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:33 PM;"I've been reading some pretty convincing arguments that the female newcomer will be Yda out of XIV, which would likely exclude the possibility of an XIV villain, anyway";;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:33 PM;Yda/Lise would be a good option;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:33 PM;And Japan loves her;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:34 PM;Which is the real demographic the game caters too so makes sense;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:35 PM;Rather;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:35 PM;That would technically also make Nael van Darnus a likely choice of villain for XIV as he is their darling;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:36 PM;But wasn't Nael only on 1.0 or something like that?;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:37 PM;Yeah he was;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:37 PM;We do have Nael deus Darnus in ARR though;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:37 PM;isn't Nael in SCOB actually Nael's sister?;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:37 PM;"Who.. With the helm on, is Nael van Darnus";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:38 PM;Nah it is the Nael we know.. Who was Nael's sister all along;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:38 PM;Because Logic xD;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:38 PM;Yeah.;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:38 PM;Basically;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:39 PM;Nael van Darnus died in battle at some point in time before we start caring;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:39 PM;And some backstory mumbo jumbo to expain the gender swap;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:39 PM;Yup;;
Mahrze#3081;10-Jan-18 12:39 PM;cuz reasons;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:39 PM;Sister takes over for him to bring honour to their house;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 12:40 PM;Because their father had been a coward or somesuch;;

Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 04:08 PM;"The new male from the old half is probably Locke. Returning female is Yuna or Tifa. Bias aside, I think Yuna has more of a shot due to playstyle. The rest? Hmmm 🤔";;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:54 PM;Won't be Tifa since the returning female is from the latter half of the series (VIII - XV);;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:55 PM;"Yeah, I realized that. It's Yuna.";;

Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:57 PM;If you want to be pedantic;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:57 PM;halfway through 7 is the second half of the series;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jan-18 11:57 PM;"Since 15/2 = 7.5, that's debatable";;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:57 PM;"IT's just easier to say 8, but there are other places they could pull from.";;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:57 PM;Like the post-PS1 era.;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jan-18 11:57 PM;It depends if you take the floor or the ceiling;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:58 PM;The devs specifically outlined what they meant by early and late;;
Malfred#1000;10-Jan-18 11:58 PM;Early was I - VII;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:58 PM;Ooooh okay.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 11:58 PM;So yeah - it's more than likely Yuna.;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jan-18 11:58 PM;Source?;;

Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:02 AM;I'd love that tbh;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:02 AM;DLC for an unreleased game is just disgusting and pathetic;;

Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:02 AM;Where these characters;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:02 AM;in this first season pass;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;are all already in the game in some capacity.;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;Tekken 7 only got 2 DLC characters so far;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;So I'm not really a fan.;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;The game shipped with a lot of characters;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;Oh;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;I mean NT also has a ton of characters to be fair.;;

Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:03 AM;not saying that doing what they are is right;;

Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:07 AM;I guess there's like;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:07 AM;the tiniest chance the vet is prishe;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:07 AM;but it's probably yuna.;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:07 AM;And one of the new males is Locke.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:07 AM;"I agree that revealing it is pretty shitty prior to release, as a last ditch effort to drum up hype";;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:07 AM;1 is Caius/Cid or Ardyn;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:08 AM;But since DLCs inception it has been something for the team to work on after the game has gone into the final stage of development;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:09 AM;"I mean, relying on DLC to drum up hype is trying to hide the fact that it isn't a good game, not even an improvement over the previous entry, as everyone here said";;

Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:09 AM;True;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:09 AM;It's like they are relying on DLC only to make a profit;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:09 AM;Which is pathetic to say the least;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:10 AM;"Honestly I think in a case like this it's less to drum up hype and more to say we know what we said and we're working on it please be patient, but also, we didn't include these guys because they weren't as relevant as these other guys.";;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:10 AM;Because going into the arcade version they told us two things;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:10 AM;They're definitely attempting to cater to a crowd that doesn't include the majority of the previous games' fans;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:10 AM;"By the end of it's dev cycle there would be nearly 50 characters, or 50 characters total";;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:10 AM;and;;

Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:10 AM;...or we didn't include these guys because they are fan favourites and people are going to buy them right away;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;I'm not convinced they'll all be fan favorites?;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;"Like, Yuna, Locke, sure.";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;Leon many characters got removed from the previous entry;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;But what if the villain that is in it for sure is _Vayn Solidor_?;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;Leon said*;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;So that's a downgrade to me;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;Presently yes.;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:11 AM;They also said that those characters _will_ be in the game.;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:12 AM;Basically stripping out a game to profit from DLC;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:12 AM;They were never in this game Marcello;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:12 AM;_Never_ in _this_ game.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:12 AM;If it is anyone from 012 being included as DLC it is a kick in the nuts since everyone wants the full cast from 012 back;;

Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:28 AM;Eww;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;a bunch of games I don't like lol;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;What?;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;The newer Dead or Alive games are awful;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;And Nioh...;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;Nope;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;Nioh is a gosh-darn masterpiece.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;Well no;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;>Nioh;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;> masterpiece;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;That's too much;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;>masterpiece;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;LOL;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;I'm done for tonight;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;Lol;;
Leon#9542;11-Jan-18 12:29 AM;"wait, is it controversial to think Nioh is good";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;I guess The Surge is also GoTY;;
Leon#9542;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;I thought everyone was into Nioh;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;But it is a pretty well refined variation on the Souls formula.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;The Surge is shit;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;Nioh is the best surge-like game ever;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;Nioh is probably better than most Souls-like games;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;Dead or Alive is dead™;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;but it will still be ass in comparison;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;What i hear most people saying is that Nioh is fun for about 20h;;
Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;like they literally have retired that series.;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;"After that, it's boring af";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:30 AM;and will never capture the real reason why people like Souls games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:31 AM;a common issue with games that try to immitate it;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:31 AM;^;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:31 AM;Pretty much;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:31 AM;Salt and Sanctuary is pretty good though;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:31 AM;I tried it for a few minutes and watched some runs;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:31 AM;It looks fun;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:32 AM;Nioh nailed the combat and satisfying difficulty angle;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:32 AM;But that's about it;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:32 AM;The combat seems a Souls carbon copy straight away;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:32 AM;I played it for a few minutes and didn't quite like it;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:33 AM;"Unfortunately, that meant less customisation in terms of playstyle (mostly weapon selection), in favour of expanded movesets for the available playstyles";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:33 AM;I even made my friend regret his purchase and sell his copy lol;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:33 AM;Huh;;
Leon#9542;11-Jan-18 12:33 AM;"idk, once you start using stances effectively, it barely even feels like Souls";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:33 AM;Indeed;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:34 AM;Dodging is also more important than blocking;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:35 AM;Technically making it closer Bloodborne I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:35 AM;"my main problem with it was how boring it was, I don't remember if I had any grips with the combat specifically";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:35 AM;https://clips.twitch.tv/GoodZanyPterodactylFunRun;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:35 AM;"It's not like I take his opinion for granted, but";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:35 AM;That's the general opinion out there;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:36 AM;At least from Souls enthusiasts;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:36 AM;Huh.. Most of the souls enthusiasts I follow are as happy with Nioh as I am.. Although I guess that could just be confirmation bias more than anything else.;;
Leon#9542;11-Jan-18 12:37 AM;^;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:37 AM;I don't know anyone that plays Souls that gives a rats ass about games like Nioh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:38 AM;"from the ones that actually found it interesting enough to try, it's very average is the general idea";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:38 AM;Pretty much;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:38 AM;I would love to try it myself though;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:39 AM;Just so I can confirm it;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:39 AM;Or maybe I can enjoy it;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:39 AM;"It's on PC, so I can wait for a sale";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:39 AM;"Or even pirate it, but I'm not in a hurry";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:41 AM;"Like I said before, it's better than most other devs that attempt to use the Souls formula but it will never be Souls was. I don't have much hope for any future games that play similar since Miyazaki already expressed that they were done anyway. Then Namco's anime souls isn't looking too great either";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:41 AM;"I tend to enjoy Soulsborne for the risk/reward of the combat and the lore.. And I'll freely admit that Nioh really only really gets near the combat, and is nowhere near as complete a package as the Souls games are.";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;Code Vein? Yeaaah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;yes;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;Pretty sure that was just faulty advertisement on their part anyway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;I'd love to give them a chance;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;"What I've seen of it so far, seems nothing like Souls";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;since they know firsthand;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:42 AM;what Souls fans like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;(being the Publisher for 1 - 3);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;but it's not looking to be anything;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;"Souls fans are annoying sobs, gotta give you that";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;"Well 1 for PC, but I understand";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;It will be hard to satisfy the souls community;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;They're also fragmented;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;Some love it for the difficulty;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:43 AM;Others the story;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:44 AM;The difficulty isn't really a factor anymore;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:44 AM;Others still love it for the PvP;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:44 AM;No one thinks they are hard games lol;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:44 AM;Or well.. Disjointed PvP;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:44 AM;Not after you've played them a million times;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:44 AM;and memorized everything lol;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:45 AM;That and the formulas are so very similar that learning one game helps you in the rest (except Bloodborne);;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:45 AM;It helps with Bloodborne too;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:45 AM;Relying on Dark Souls muscle memory for Bloodborne is pretty much a recipe for dying;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:45 AM;Not really;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;BB will be hard for you probably for Yharnam's opening alone;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;The areas are pretty easy as a souls player;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;after that;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;As opposed to Demons Souls and the other Dark Souls.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;you should have adjusted;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;Oh defnitely;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;Eventually you get into the loop;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:46 AM;"but as a returning player, a lot of the concepts still apply";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:47 AM;I guess this conversation has strayed from #new-upcoming and is more of an #off-topic discussion now;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:47 AM;"hell, even blocking isn't all that effective in games like DS1";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:47 AM;"Well, the only concepts that didn't apply were backstabbing and using a shield (which, let's be honest, we never use them anyway)";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:47 AM;Still wildly popular;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;Dark Souls 2 was best though;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;Eh...;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;Powerstancing dual shields;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;what did you say;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;With a turtle knight armour;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;Full-on turtle;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:48 AM;DS2 is great (possibly my favourite) but I can't say it was the best lol;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;"Best in terms of shields, not in the sense of best among the Souls games";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;I think I'm having a heart attack;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;oh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;ok I'm fine;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;"That game suffered development hell and a director change, so it was really impressive it didn't sucked bad";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;you almost killed me with that bud;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;Hard to pick one that is best among them.. They're great in various ways.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;saying such things without context;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:49 AM;Turtle Knights though;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:50 AM;I can't pick a best;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:50 AM;Though I would say BB is the most polished of all the souls games;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:50 AM;Less features and mechanics you hate;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:50 AM;I can sorta pick a best;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:50 AM;but for varying reasons;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:51 AM;Demons Souls holds a special place in my heart solely for being the originator;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:51 AM;"I like BB all round, and yes it is the most polished. Has the best presentation as well and makes for a damn good experience your first time around";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;But it is far from the best;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;the environments;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;the atmosphere;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;"it's all there, wrapped together in a pretty little bow";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;also the game was on sale recently;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;It seems short though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;complete edition for $17;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;Shorter than the other games;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;But the content that is there is very satisfying;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:52 AM;Much like a certain ribbon you get from a large mutant pig?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:53 AM;a pig that you can fist;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:53 AM;yes;;

Treble#5035;11-Jan-18 12:53 AM;"uh, hey y'all?";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:53 AM;"I mean, I'm almost beating the game and it only took me 20h";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:53 AM;And the game itself feels denser than the rest;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:53 AM;Oh cool;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:54 AM;Probably because I'm a souls veteran though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:54 AM;"```, Shorter than the other games, ```, Somewhat yes, but that's mainly factoring in main game alone";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:54 AM;and whether or not you did anything outside of that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:54 AM;"DLC, Chalice, Online stuff";;

Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:56 AM;My first playthrough of Dark Souls 2 took me 40-something hours;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:56 AM;Ludwig hype though;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:56 AM;The second one only took 15;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:56 AM;Hopefully I'll start and finish my old Hunters' playthrough soon;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:56 AM;Ng+?;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:58 AM;Yes;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:58 AM;"Ah, yeah";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:58 AM;Unless you're asking if you should do Old Hunters on NG+;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:58 AM;Then no;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:58 AM;Did you finish the DLCs?;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;DS2 DLCs are amazing;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;"Better than the base game, tbh";;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;That was before the first DLC came out;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;Yes;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;Yes they were;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;Crown of the Ivory king was exceptional;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;Sunken City was amazing;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;Even if the bosses were a bit dull;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;I gotta remember to finish my NG+ run of BB as well. One thing I love about BB was that even though there was a lack of weapons. They're pretty cool when you actually sit down and use them;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 12:59 AM;Yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;You know;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;Gank squad still a meme tho;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;That's one part of the Souls formula;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;Ivory King and Iron King had some of the best bosses though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;that needs to be fixed;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;What?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;weapon upgrading is annoying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:00 AM;I'm fine with them being tuned to different builds;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:01 AM;but I hate having to manage upgrade levels separately;;
Malfred#1000;11-Jan-18 01:01 AM;Ah yes;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:01 AM;I'm fine with that;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:01 AM;The games give you plenty of materials while you play;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:01 AM;"It's what makes people not use anything in BB other than the saw cleaver and LHB, since it's just not worth the time";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:02 AM;unless you know what you want specifically;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:03 AM;"```, The games give you plenty of materials while you play, ```, they do, but then you reach the barrier, where you need different material types then there's this disconnect of having a weapon that's at a lower level but you just used your upgrades for your main, etc...";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:04 AM;it's arguably worse in the other games from BB because most of the movesets are the same except in certain situations;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:04 AM;"Yeah, I agree on that";;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:05 AM;I feel like DS2 has the best weapons though;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:05 AM;"I mean, the best variety of weapons";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:06 AM;I suppose;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:06 AM;but yeah I'm not a fan of the upgrading system specifically;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:06 AM;maybe it's because I never like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:06 AM;cared for crafting related stuff in any game;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:07 AM;It sometimes feels like you can't really try everything;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:07 AM;you can;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:07 AM;but the game loves to tease you;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:07 AM;which is why I wish respec was a mechanic shared across all 5 games;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:07 AM;DS2 does it better because there are plenty of slabs;;
Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:08 AM;Is there a respec feature in BB?;;

Marcello#4574;11-Jan-18 01:09 AM;You can appreciate DS2 for introducing it though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:09 AM;I can tolerate it in games like Horizon I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:10 AM;it's not that bad there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Jan-18 01:10 AM;"since it's primarily for ammo, and weapons just have upgrade nodes attached to them that can easily be replaced";;

Malfred#1000;13-Jan-18 04:17 AM;You need coordination with teammates to do anything resembling a combo;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Jan-18 07:52 AM;Part of the problem might be having poorly coordinated matched teams.  I'm curious as to how the game plays if you actually work with people ahead of time and balance out your party.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Jan-18 09:11 AM;"From my experience, team coordination (with randos) usually results with one being the snobby elitist leader who knows **everything** about the game, is demanding orders with extreme vagueness cause they're lacking context and he's using terminology only fellow snobby elitists know.

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jan-18 10:37 AM;yeah but that's just part of meeting people and general interaction;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Jan-18 10:38 AM;when you initially meet these people in game for the first time it is very unlikely there will be much coordination until you gather up enough people and know their strengths and weaknesses;;

Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:16 PM;Just as a side note as I noticed a few people confused about loot boxes in dissidia they're just rewards alongside the game. Everything can be bought for Gil. The loot box is just an additional reward it's not bought for real money etc which is neat.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Jan-18 05:18 PM;Why loot boxes though? Why not just have us pick what we want to buy?;;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:18 PM;You can though the shop is available for Gil etc.;;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:19 PM;The loot boxes is just added incentive while leveling etc. Just a neat trick to reward folks for matches and campaign;;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:19 PM;Say you want clouds sword and you get lucky through a loot box. So the Gil you saved can now be used for sephiroths.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Jan-18 05:20 PM;"In other words, Square's adding loot boxes just to be hip and cool";;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:20 PM;Kinda I guess. I think it's probably to make people feel rewarded for online matches etc.;;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:20 PM;Beats the shit out of buying costumes through dlc.;;

Marcello#4574;14-Jan-18 05:34 PM;Which is pathetic too;;
Marcello#4574;14-Jan-18 05:34 PM;They even have the guts to charge $60 for Dissidia;;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:34 PM;Tbf to make it in the esports which is what dissidia aims to do. Regular updates will occur. But character etc won't be free. Which I'm not surprised about I expected but I've played fighters for years.;;
Tholgark / Jay#2616;14-Jan-18 05:35 PM;"They've done it with tekken, street fighter,  marvel Vs capcom. So it doesn't surprise me";;

💣Dekomlev (Декомлев)💥#1337;17-Jan-18 05:10 PM;Is Windows Edtion for FFXV going to be like 150GB? Makes sense to me. FFXV is a very big game and it's going to keep getting bigger as time passes on.;;

Chimpy#5375;17-Jan-18 05:12 PM;Uncompressed audio is the reason why 13 was so big on Steam. You could probably shave off 47 or so gigs if they just made the other languages DLC.;;

Maximilian#8443;31-Aug-18 09:22 PM;So it would make sense to come out after ff7r and ff8r so around 2025;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:03 PM;Wait FF8 is going to have a remake?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:04 PM;not confirmed;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:04 PM;Actually haven't heard any rumors of it either;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:04 PM;"so uh, I call bogus";;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:04 PM;It would suck if SE made another remake before 16;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:05 PM;Like the more projects they have the longer I'll have to wait;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:05 PM;Don't think it's the same studio working on VIIR that worked on XV;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:05 PM;I might be wrong;;

Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:21 PM;NT is still a thing and Rinoa is in it so it's not as terrible.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Aug-18 10:24 PM;You mean the same thing 7 calls it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:24 PM;That's not a very good reason not to like a character lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Aug-18 10:24 PM;^;;
Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:25 PM;I enjoy Rinoa because I'm an VIII fanboy.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:26 PM;Maybe not not like just I wasn't a fan of using her in battles;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:26 PM;Character-wise she's good;;
Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:26 PM;Wishing Star and Invincible Moon were so good.;;

Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:26 PM;Exactly hahaha;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;I don't really recall using limit breaks in 8 lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;the only limits I use in 8 is Squalls;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;*maybe* Zells;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;and even less maybe Selphies;;
Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;Limits are the best DPS method.;;
Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;Zell's breaks the game if you do it right;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;Yeah I literally just spammed Squall's limit break at the final boss lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;31-Aug-18 10:28 PM;Triple Triad is the best DPS method;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:29 PM;**Triple Triad** lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Aug-18 10:29 PM;what's funny about TT?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;31-Aug-18 10:29 PM;Completing that Queen of Cards or whatever was so confusing for me;;
Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:30 PM;I never do Queen of Cards;;
Dinoken2#0946;31-Aug-18 10:30 PM;Just wait till Time Compression and get them off her there.;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 09:58 PM;They're no the same slog;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 09:58 PM;Persona early-game is of the wait 2 hours for the next gameplay phase;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 09:59 PM;Xenoblade 1's early-game slog is caused by being stuck with the *absolute* worst team in the game for really;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 09:59 PM;Really long;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 09:59 PM;"Yeah, Xenoblade is like a 30 hour slog until you get to anything interesting";;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 09:59 PM;More if you're slow like me;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:00 PM;Haven't played 2 before though so I can't comment on that one;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:00 PM;Xenoblade 2... doesn't have the pacing issues 1 has;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:00 PM;But by the *gods* does it have issues;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:01 PM;I stopped playing it after that touch my chest line;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:01 PM;I mean;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:01 PM;come on man;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:01 PM;I'm glad I didn't buy a switch for it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:02 PM;If I had to summarize what I think of 2;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:02 PM;"It's a game designed by amateurs, but realized by pros";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:02 PM;I never said who did the riot lol;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:02 PM;Yeah but you said Japan exclusive;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:03 PM;And I said it was released in Japan only until a riot from operation rainfall;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:03 PM;Which is *false*;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:03 PM;Which got it a Europe release which hit U.S shelves in gamestop;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:03 PM;Because Rainfall happened after the EU release;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:04 PM;Or at least;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:04 PM;After it was announced for Europe;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:04 PM;I mean I'd play it Europe wise;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:04 PM;I already did;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:04 PM;"But there were 5 month between announcement and release, so that's not much difference";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:05 PM;Well it wouldn't take years;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:05 PM;Its just a translation change;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:05 PM;Since Europe already got theirs;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:05 PM;It wouldn't be hard to work off of that;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:05 PM;Infact I have a pic;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:06 PM;Of Shulk failing to sync to his nvm lmao;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:06 PM;Idk why but Shulk's model animations were the most strange of the cast;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:06 PM;That's all;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:07 PM;But XB1 took me 68 hours to beat;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:07 PM;"About the same, when I first played it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:07 PM;"About 45 hours when I replayed it, last winter";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:07 PM;"I just used a basic Dunban, Shulk and Melia";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:07 PM;Until I got Seven;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:07 PM;Replaced Dunban;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Solid team;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;"Did the same, but replaced Shulk";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Tbh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;As a form of... challenge;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Shulk is one of the only good AI's;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Not that hard;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Considering how boring his set is;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Melia is god awful;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;It's why I evicted him of my team;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Nah his set is solid af;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;He's so boring to play;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Healer;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Buffer;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;It's *way* too solid;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;Debuffer;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:08 PM;That's the thing;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:09 PM;Dps;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:09 PM;He's the all around one;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:09 PM;Shulk's too OP for his own good;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:09 PM;I mean he has that busted sword;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:09 PM;Melia is more broken;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:09 PM;I swear I've seen people clean zanza with in 5 mins using her;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:10 PM;And his fights on average takes atlaest 15;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:10 PM;"His fights when I replayed the game took me less than 5 minutes, clearly";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:10 PM;Which team;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:10 PM;"Seven, Melia, Dunban";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:10 PM;Stall or dps;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Yep dps;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;"I thought I'd have trouble without Shulk, but that was not the case";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Stall can take up to an hour;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Seven absolutely eviscerated him;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;And is boring as all hell;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Shulk is only busted vs like mechon and telethia tbh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Well he's necessary;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Yep;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Unless you setup some really stupid stuff;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Until post game;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:11 PM;I tossed him out;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;It's really annoying having to use a character for specific type of enemies because the game says so;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;But y'know;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;"Seven, Melia, Riki is post game";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;muh story immersion;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;I mean;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;If there wasn't;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;Shulk would have little purpose;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;Other than being that Jack of all trade;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:12 PM;Who can be replaced;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;At least there's an easy means to damage mechons without Shulk in the team;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;Yep;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;"Telethia, not so much";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;Not that I remember anyway;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;They have a field;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;Which grants them invincibility;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;I'm aware;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;Only shulk can remove it with monado purge;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;But meh;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:13 PM;Tired of that shit lol;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:14 PM;Waste of my art charge;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:14 PM;Could be slamming debuffs or buffs;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:14 PM;But nah;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:14 PM;Every time it decides to spam the barrier;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:14 PM;Lol;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:15 PM;I hate Telethia in XB1;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:15 PM;And X;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:15 PM;Blew up my fuel on my skell in X;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:15 PM;Took me hours to refill them;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:15 PM;...;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:16 PM;But honestly the worst thing in XB1;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:16 PM;Is trying to fight stuff higher than ya;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:16 PM;My friend spent 6 hrs fighting a level 80 monster as a lvl 62;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:16 PM;I was watching his stream bored af;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:17 PM;Can't believe he didn't quit;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:18 PM;It's not so bad if you know how the level difference malus works;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:18 PM;"Their very existence is dumb, imo";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:18 PM;"But if you know how they work, you can fight a bit more underleveled than usual";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:18 PM;A 18 level differential is enormous;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:19 PM;You can make up for it pretty much only if you reach post-game;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:19 PM;Well tbf;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:20 PM;He used;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:20 PM;Fucking sharla in there;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:20 PM;I told him she is going to make every fight 2x longer;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:20 PM;As her dps and overall healing game is weak;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:20 PM;And the AI makes it worse lol;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;But yeah 18 levels is huge;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;Sharla is bar none the worst character in the game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;oh lol maybe that's why my fights were taking so long;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;TIL;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;She is just bad;;
Thelitedragon#4507;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;well I'll never go back to Xenoblade C anyways;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;The only way I see her being used is one;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;They like her;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:21 PM;2 they like long ass fights;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:22 PM;"If you use Sharla, you're playing this game wrong";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:22 PM;It ain't wrong kind of;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:22 PM;She is just the hope of XB1;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:22 PM;and if you play X;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:22 PM;You know they are both half ass healers;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:23 PM;Honestly all chars are good;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:23 PM;But Sharla;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Riki with his great dps;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Dunban dps and tank same as seven;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Melia insane dps;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Shulk all around;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Reyn great tank;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Then comes Sharla;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Bad ho;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:24 PM;Hp*;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:25 PM;def;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:25 PM;Dps;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:25 PM;And not even the best healer;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:25 PM;*sigh*;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:26 PM;She even overheats her rifle;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:26 PM;This would be be understandable if she does crazy burst damage;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:26 PM;But she has the weakest neutral attack;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:26 PM;Monolith be trolling lool;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:27 PM;This is why tbh X has a more fun battle system;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;06-Sep-18 10:28 PM;More versatility;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:33 PM;Way more versatility;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;06-Sep-18 10:34 PM;"Your avatar is still the most broken guy around, by far";;

Maximilian#8443;10-Sep-18 06:42 PM;My 2nd favorite ff game hell yes!!;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;10-Sep-18 08:50 PM;Cc is hype;;
Maximilian#8443;10-Sep-18 11:38 PM;I wish we knew what month it will drop in the US;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:40 PM;Is the Last Remnant big in Japan?;;
Leon#9542;11-Sep-18 03:41 PM;"Not like FF or DQ levels of big, but I hear it is more liked over there.";;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:41 PM;Wondering why we are getting a remaster when no one asked for it. Would make sense if it was popular in Japan.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:42 PM;It's not very good tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:42 PM;But I mean CC getting one too and that's not something was well known either;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:43 PM;Are they changing things for the remaster?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:43 PM;For CC?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:43 PM;Idk I think they will just give it dedicated servers;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:44 PM;The game is like somewhat of a mini mmo even though you can solo it;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:44 PM;For TLR.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:44 PM;Oh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:44 PM;Idk either;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:44 PM;"CC, I'm kinda excited for. Seems like a good call.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-18 03:44 PM;Will probably just be the usual visual update;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:45 PM;It's really old and alot of people never had the chance to play it.;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:45 PM;Yeah. That would suck.;;
Leon#9542;11-Sep-18 03:45 PM;"No changes for Last Remnant. But they are adding the turbo mode options that were in the PC version, but not the original console versions.";;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:46 PM;Turbo?;;
Leon#9542;11-Sep-18 03:46 PM;Just increased battle speed;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:46 PM;Ah;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:46 PM;Yeah. That's a game I've gone back and forth on buying and never did.;;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:47 PM;Ill probably cave in when the games on sale for 15 bucks in 3 years.;;
Leon#9542;11-Sep-18 03:48 PM;"Was on sale a lot for like $3 on Steam. They removed that version last week, but aren't putting this remastered version on PC, which is kinda dumb.";;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:48 PM;I'll come on PC in a year.;;
Marcello#4574;11-Sep-18 03:48 PM;yay to piracy;;
Marcello#4574;11-Sep-18 03:48 PM;"Good job, Square";;
MajorBroski#8359;11-Sep-18 03:48 PM;That's what they are doing now for whatever stupid reason.;;
Leon#9542;11-Sep-18 03:48 PM;"It's a really weird game. I don't think it's very good, but it was interesting. I never finished it, but I'll probably jump on the remaster too when it's cheaper to give it another shot.";;

Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 05:49 PM;"If Square are secretly working on another game, then that would explain why things are taking so long to come out";;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Sep-18 05:50 PM;Or Square's just terribly mismanaged;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 05:50 PM;Or their budgets are just overblown;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Sep-18 05:50 PM;Incompetence is what I'd put my money on;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 05:50 PM;The VII remake is way too large in terms of scope;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 05:52 PM;And Square announced it years ago;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 05:52 PM;For release in late 2020.;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 05:52 PM;"My guess is that once KH3 releases, we'll see more previews of the VII remake";;
Izwar Vain#5689;24-Sep-18 06:11 PM;"Yeah, I think SE is pretty mismanaged";;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 06:12 PM;"But Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Final Fantasy XV and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are all pretty good";;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 06:16 PM;I'm more interested in what's being rereleased from their back catalog. They dropped the ball with there being no Tactics Ogre on the SNES classic.;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 06:16 PM;Hopefully we'll get a remaster on PC.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Sep-18 06:28 PM;Deus ex and Tomb Raider aren't developed by Square though;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Sep-18 06:29 PM;"And yeah, Square, at least recently, have been announcing games too early";;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 06:30 PM;I know;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 06:32 PM;Square are at least decent when it comes to porting their back catalog. Same with Capcom;;
Giant Enemy Crab#0569;24-Sep-18 06:33 PM;"Bamco, Konami and Koei Tecmo are all pretty bad when it comes to porting old games to PC and current gen consoles.";;

IUisbae#5839;01-Oct-18 03:18 PM;That's the only main ff I played lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;03-Oct-18 07:51 AM;"I don't think Square has announced or hinted at any upcoming VI content.  I've heard rumors and fan speculation that it might get remade after VII or that Terra might be in Smash, but there's nothing substantial behind those claims and it seems like just fan's daydreaming., , There are credible leaks for Smash that say there's gonna be another Square character besides Cloud, and it could possibly be Terra, but I feel Sora or Geno are more likely candidates.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Oct-18 07:59 AM;"Yeah, Sora would be more reasonable";;
