lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:24 AM;"Woot fat fingers, give me a sec to edit that! :thief:";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:33 AM;man I can't wait;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:34 AM;it's crazy how much effort consistently goes into this game;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:35 AM;Yeah XIV was SE only saving grace for a while with how bad the launch version of FFXV was.;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:35 AM;What level are you?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:35 AM;37;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:35 AM;a long way to go;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:36 AM;What server?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:36 AM;lamia;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:37 AM;Ah neat. Yeah you could always buy a skip potion & jump right into Stormblood but youd be doing yourself a MAJOR disservice skipping Heavensward....;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:37 AM;(You should also buy a server transfer to Siren);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:38 AM;is there a way to skip to just the end of ARR?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:39 AM;also yeah I might switch over;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:41 AM;I beleive their is... Let me check mogstation;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:42 AM;;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/421131276440043537/422419057564975104/Screenshot_20180311-104208.jpg;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:43 AM;The $18 option will rocket you up to the start of Heavensward.;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:44 AM;Honestly Ive been debating on writing up a FFXIV crash course plot summary for those who decide to buy their way into Stormblood/Heavensward.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:45 AM;nice;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:45 AM;I'll be looking into this;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:46 AM;I have not been in the mood to play lately due to the RtY event for Bloodborne;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:46 AM;and ARR is a real chore tbh;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:46 AM;Its a huge time saver as their are approximately 100 quests between The end of ARR base story & the start of Heavensward.;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 09:47 AM;"Yeah i picked up free Bloodborne, cant wait to play it 6 months from now when im not putting 5+ hours into XIV every day! :pupu:";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 09:47 AM;have fun;;
themockingguy#6969;11-Mar-18 10:42 AM;Is there really that much quests between the base game and the expansions;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;11-Mar-18 10:44 AM;Yes;;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 10:47 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 10:47 AM;"Not quite as many between HW and SB, but still a lot";;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 10:52 AM;"Not sure why anyone would skip the MSQ though, especially on their first playthrough.";;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 10:52 AM;The storyline is great.;;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 10:53 AM;Not so much the original storyline;;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 10:53 AM;"But yeah, the content between ARR and HW was pretty darn good";;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 10:54 AM;"If nothing else, skipping does unlock the cutscenes in your journal in the inn room";;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 10:54 AM;So you can always sit down and watch them that way;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 11:02 AM;I think the overall plot of ARR is fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 11:03 AM;but the way it plays out in the questline is so boring;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 11:03 AM;too many errand boy quests;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 11:04 AM;Even if I just blast through the main story it'll take like a year to get to HW :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-18 11:04 AM;so it is a tease to know that the fun parts are really in the post game of ARR and the two expansions;;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:33 AM;"When I played it, A Realm Reborn took me over 200hrs to complete.";;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:34 AM;I'm assuming Heavensward and Stormblood would probably be similar.;;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:36 AM;"I heaven't completed all of Heavensward, like the post expansion stuff. But I clock in at around 1k hours from start of A Realm Reborn to Heavensward.";;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 11:40 AM;I'm not a fan of A Realm Reborn storyline. I think heavensward is fantastic and stormblood is somewhere in the middle;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 11:41 AM;Just finished the ivalice raid they were painful because I didn't look up a guide but they're still super dope;;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:41 AM;"I didn't mind it, probably because I spent the first two years playing it. So it amounts to most of the moments I've spent in Final Fantasy XIV.";;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:42 AM;Even though I didn't reach level 50 until patch 2.1 launched.;;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:43 AM;But patch 2.1 was probably the best patch that had ever launched. Crystal Tower was just to awesome.;;
Silverx1987#9781;11-Mar-18 11:44 AM;The Ivalice raid is a 24man right?;;
lilvon#5479;11-Mar-18 11:45 AM;"Yep, you fight Tactics and FFXII bosses/summons";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 02:17 PM;I love how right before the ifrit dungeon you get captured;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 02:17 PM;Then I just teleported straight to the gold saucer;;
Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 02:29 PM;"Canonically the other captives find a way out, but are afraid of being found out if they all flee, so they send you out to get reinforcements.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 02:34 PM;Yeah and I went to gamble 👀 :;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 02:35 PM;"In other news, I walked from Limsa to Costa Del Sol";;

Malfred#1000;11-Mar-18 02:40 PM;Mostly because I was in the neighbourhood already at level 5;;

Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 02:41 PM;I tried to get there from the wrong side of la noscea;;
Thelitedragon#4507;11-Mar-18 02:42 PM;So I kept getting shit on by level 32 mobs :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
themockingguy#6969;11-Mar-18 11:49 PM;"Question about scholar and summoner, I just got the quests for each of them and just finished the scholar one, since technically is the same class (ARC) and each job depends on the soul equiped, does that mean when you level up Scholar you also level up Summoner and vice versa?";;
lilvon#5479;12-Mar-18 12:30 AM;Thays exactly how that works;;
lilvon#5479;12-Mar-18 12:30 AM;Though youll need to still do the individual job quests to get thise Job skills.;;
themockingguy#6969;12-Mar-18 12:32 AM;"That's so cool, so even if I want to play summoner, I can play scholar as well if is needed because I already have it leveled up.";;
lilvon#5479;12-Mar-18 01:02 AM;"Basically, just make sure you do the Job quests for both or youll be missing crucial Job skills.";;
Malfred#1000;12-Mar-18 02:10 AM;Mostly your pets;;

Malfred#1000;13-Mar-18 12:28 AM;"30+ allows for a decent variety of dungeons to run, you get to unlock the Chocobo companion, jobs become a thing, and more";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;24-Mar-18 07:47 PM;You never reach the end of ARR;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Mar-18 07:47 PM;I'm getting a feeling that it's a bottomless pit;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 07:53 PM;now enjoy the game throwing 1500000 more fetchquests in your face before the end;;
Silverx1987#9781;24-Mar-18 07:53 PM;"Not bad, atleast at launch there was a gap where you didn't have anymore MSQ and had to grind. I think it was somewhere in the level 40s.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 07:54 PM;I'm glad they allow you to P2W your way out of it;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 07:56 PM;yes;;
Silverx1987#9781;24-Mar-18 07:57 PM;"I didn't get it at first because the bulk of your playthrough will be going through the MSQ. I mean it's literally hundreds of hours. I personally didn't mind it, especially when you really only have to do it once because there's really no point on leveling more than one character besides having more than one race/gender.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 07:58 PM;maybe if you have the time to waste sure;;
Silverx1987#9781;24-Mar-18 07:58 PM;"Not really having the time the waste, but it's apart of the game that you pay for. Unless all you really care about is endgame.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 07:59 PM;but if I only have a so many hours of free time I definitely don't want to spend it teleporting to all ends of the earth talking to NPCs 20 times between each dungeon/boss;;

Silverx1987#9781;24-Mar-18 08:03 PM;"Not really, there's all sorts of reasons people play the game. Story is one of them, which makes sense. It being an MMO will surely attract players who are only in it for endgame. But there are those who play it for the story and Final Fantasy XIV has a vast amount for what you pay for it. It just comes with a subscription cost. I'm sure if it didn't have a subscription cost it would be just like any of the previous Final Fantasy titles that isn't an MMO.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 08:04 PM;My issue isn't that it has a story;;
Silverx1987#9781;24-Mar-18 08:04 PM;"From A Realm Reborn all through Heavensward (since I haven't touched on Stormblood) is that the game plays very much like a single player heavily on story, except for moments where you have to queue up for a dungeon/trial.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Mar-18 08:04 PM;I like the story but I hate all of the padding in between events that was clearly added to make the game longer so that they had more time to get the more exciting stuff ready;;

Silverx1987#9781;24-Mar-18 08:07 PM;I remember when gil was sparse. Teleporting around wasn't very good on your wallet since you didn't obtain that many gil until you started crafting and selling those relic required items.;;

Malfred#1000;25-Mar-18 09:54 AM;I'm pretty sure that you need to have at least one other class at level 60 and have completed the Heavensward story before you can access SAM I am;;

Thelitedragon#4507;25-Mar-18 09:55 AM;Cuz both quests are off random people in Ul'dah;;

themockingguy#6969;25-Mar-18 10:15 AM;Because the quests are in Ul'dah;;
themockingguy#6969;25-Mar-18 10:17 AM;"I think dark night and machinist are the ones you can only get after ARR, because the quests are obteined in a expansion zone";;

themockingguy#6969;25-Mar-18 10:17 AM;Server preferred bonus;;

themockingguy#6969;25-Mar-18 10:19 AM;Because I don't want to loose the bonus just yet;;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:19 AM;"I believe Astro, Dark Knight and Machinists are all Heavensward classes/jobs.";;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:20 AM;You also get another bonus aswell.;;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:20 AM;I think it's called the Armory bonus. Depending on how big a difference between your highest level class/job you get an experience bonus.;;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:21 AM;So your second class/job will always level up quicker than your first.;;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:22 AM;"`The Armory Bonus is additional experience granted to any combat class you have that is NOT your highest level class. From levels 1-59, you receive +100% additional experience for secondary classes that are lower level than your highest level class. At level 60, this bonus decreases to only 50%. The amount of experience granted has nothing to do with the distance in levels from your highest class.`";;

Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:23 AM;I guess the difference doesn't really matter.;;
themockingguy#6969;25-Mar-18 10:23 AM;"Yeah, I noticed that yesterday leveling yesterday, I was getting 300% experience when killing mobs";;
themockingguy#6969;25-Mar-18 10:24 AM;Wonder where the extra 100% comes from 🤔;;
Silverx1987#9781;25-Mar-18 10:24 AM;"100% would probably be the base, + 100% from Armory and another + 100% from the Preferred Server I'm assuming.";;

Thelitedragon#4507;25-Mar-18 01:11 PM;Its three octaves;;

lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:17 PM;Yeah i had to take about a year break from the game. When I was modded to the subreddit I figured I could take this oppurtunity to get more people interested in FFXIV since that was half the reason I was even added to the team.;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:18 PM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 well be happy to help you blow threw it like we did with Rosa so you can get to that sweet deliciousness that is Heavensward.;;

Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:20 PM;I'm sure people will trickle in back to the game and join thanks to the post you guys put up. I still have lots of HW to do since I stopped around the time I barely got it.;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:20 PM;Was Stormblood good too?;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:21 PM;"Good, but not as good as Heavensward.";;

lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:24 PM;Some things happen & Yda is set front & center as this Xpacs main companion similiar to how Ysayle & Estinien shared that role in Heavensward. But unlike those 2 she isnt NEARLY as compelling as the Heavensward cast & is pretty much a limp wet noodle thays good at punching things for most of Stormblood base story.;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:24 PM;I can speak Spanish too so I can help out with thay.;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:25 PM;@lilvon#5479 I'm sure they will work on that for the next expansion to avoid having a weak story again then. Fingers crossed.;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:27 PM;"The story is still compelling enough but its your companions as characters that carry half of it since your player characters a silent protag. And Yda as a main character isnt strong enough to carry it. The others such as Alphinaud, his sister, Cyan, and the villian Zenos are all fantastic tho.";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:28 PM;No spoilers plz;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:28 PM;"That & the patch stories have been pretty excellent honestly. Yda even begins to step it up a bit, despite being such a wet noodle in the base story.";;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:28 PM;No worries no spoilers here.;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:29 PM;About how long was the life span of HW before stormblood came out?;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:30 PM;About 2 years.;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:30 PM;Tho SB may be a bit longer from certain comments Yoshi-P has made.;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:31 PM;So we should be getting another expansion next year;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:31 PM;Oh I see;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:31 PM;There was 4 or 5 expansions planned for this game? Or there never was a set number?;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:31 PM;Yeah im expecting late Next year at the earliest.;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:32 PM;I dont think theirs a set number;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:32 PM;Im sure theyll continue to release Xpacs as long as its profitable.;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:32 PM;But I don't see xiv going away anytime soon;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:32 PM;Just like how FFXI got Xpacs all the way up to 2015.;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:33 PM;You guys played ffxi?;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:33 PM;Is SE stable money printing machine to fund other terrible games (looking at you FFXV);;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:34 PM;Lol yeah that & their mobile titles like Opera Omnia & Brave Exvius;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:34 PM;I never played XI no;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:35 PM;"Me neither, was too young when FFXI was still a thing";;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:35 PM;But one of our higher ranking officers from before the FC was Reddit Wings is an old XI vet.;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:36 PM;I was too young for ffxi too;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:36 PM;It came out somewhere around 2005 right?;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:36 PM;This is honestly the first real MMO I ever played.;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:37 PM;"No, it came out in 2002";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:37 PM;I was 5 when it came out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Apr-18 11:37 PM;it was a really ambitious title;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Apr-18 11:37 PM;especially for the PS2 version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Apr-18 11:38 PM;not only being one of the few games to make use of the PS2's HDD/Ethernet adapter;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Apr-18 11:38 PM;but to have an entire MMO running on that thing was pretty damn cool by itself;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:38 PM;"And is one of the only games to have cross play between PlayStation, PC and Xbox";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:39 PM;Well had;;

themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:45 PM;"Too bad the trade off is, y'know, work";;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:47 PM;Yeah my job now makes it so I can only play at super inconvenient hours. T_T;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:48 PM;I interviewed at a pest control spot a few weeks ago they told me to call back up their on Wednesday so well so how it goes.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 11:48 PM;We found out Von likes watching the occasional bar fight;;

Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:50 PM;I've been doing so much OT at my job but thankfully I'm only doing mornings now even though I get home until late evening usually. And that's if I don't go out or something.;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:50 PM;So the online personality test for employment was REALLY weird.;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:51 PM;"They asked the usual stuff like how well do you work with others, what do you do when you see someone stealing,  etc.";;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:51 PM;But then their were a lot of WEIRD questions like how do you feel about fighting? Can you defend yourself in an altercation;;
lilvon#5479;23-Apr-18 11:52 PM;I guess this pest control company fights some REALLY mean roaches! :HAHAHAHAHA: :HAHAHAHAHA: :HAHAHAHAHA: :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 11:52 PM;Imagine Von throwing down with a monster roach;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Apr-18 11:52 PM;Is it that personality test that classificates you in like 12 different personalities?;;
Mines of Moria#4860;23-Apr-18 11:53 PM;Sounds like a dangerous job lol. Get beat up by mean roaches on a dark place you know.;;

themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:15 PM;the first reference in the game to other FF games is the crystal tower right?;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:15 PM;cloud of darkness;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:16 PM;and a drop is an onion knight minion;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:16 PM;I think the 1st major reference is actually Sastasha. The very 1st dungeon at level 15!;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:16 PM;what's the reference?;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:16 PM;I missed it?;;

lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:17 PM;XIVs instance is a call back to FFVs 1st dungeon Sastasha is a pirate hideout similiar to the SNES titles 1st dungeon.;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:17 PM;Both are pirate hideouts with secet passages.;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:17 PM;Give me a second to check the enemies & see if they line up as well;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:17 PM;"Oh, I see, haven't played V yet";;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:20 PM;I'd say is pretty unnoticeable if you are not familiar with FFV;;
Malfred#1000;24-Apr-18 02:20 PM;"There's also a lot of smaller story references, but Sastasha is the first overt one.";;
Socindwich#0753;24-Apr-18 02:20 PM;I think I made my character too tall;;
Malfred#1000;24-Apr-18 02:20 PM;No such thing;;
Socindwich#0753;24-Apr-18 02:20 PM;🤔;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:20 PM;Depends;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:21 PM;I'm a lala so everyone is tall;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:21 PM;except other lalas;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:21 PM;Both dungeons have crabs & bats tho the FFXIV dungeon has the pirates & dogs;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:21 PM;"And a coerl, a lot more enemy variety, which is needed for an MMO over an SNES game i guess.";;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:22 PM;when I made my char they didn't warn me about the amount of /pet I'll be getting;;
Socindwich#0753;24-Apr-18 02:22 PM;Can you play the trial more than once?;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:22 PM;"yeah, until you get to lvl 35 on a class, so you can't take MSQs after that";;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:23 PM;but technically you could make any amount of chars that you'd like;;
Socindwich#0753;24-Apr-18 02:23 PM;So would you have to delete the level 35 character to make another one?;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:23 PM;Petting lalas is a personal favorite passtime of mine.;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:24 PM;"@Socindwich#0753 No, you can still play";;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:24 PM;and make other charachers;;
themockingguy#6969;24-Apr-18 02:24 PM;but you'll be capped at 35;;
Socindwich#0753;24-Apr-18 02:25 PM;I most likely won't get a subscription for a long time;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:25 PM;@Socindwich#0753 make sure you make your character on Siren server Arther data center so we can play togther! 👍;;
Socindwich#0753;24-Apr-18 02:26 PM;Can f2ps play with friends?;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:28 PM;Yes! However there are a few restrictions like not being able to join the free company.;;

lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:42 PM;Well sidequests in general usually dont have voice work. Its reserved for the main story.;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:42 PM;The raids arent even voiced from what i remember.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Apr-18 02:43 PM;bosses are though right?;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:43 PM;I think only none MSQ quests that get voice work are the primals.;;

lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:45 PM;Yep! During the time freezes.;;
lilvon#5479;24-Apr-18 02:46 PM;Theirs also an add phase where you go back in time in the middle of the fight & save yourself from getting blown the fuck up in the cutscene before the fight!;;

themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:24 PM;not soon;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:24 PM;like they just stay in Shield Oath 100% of the fight and their DPS is shit;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:24 PM;or they don't pop or save cooldowns at the right times;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:24 PM;and force the healers to do twice as much work and waste their MP;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:24 PM;"it's definitely easier and less stressful to play DPS at entry-level compared to the other two, but playing a DPS in XIV is like playing a spreadsheet at times";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:24 PM;the thing is;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;as a tank you still need to worry about a DPS rotation;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;on top of worrying about tank mechanics and stance dancing;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:25 PM;this is true;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;and our rotations isn't much easier than a standard dps rotation;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:25 PM;but tank dps rotations are super easy to pick up;;
themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:25 PM;"I like playing healer,  but I prefer to learn a DPS properly, i need to learn SMN";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;"we have our AoE rotation, our single target rotation";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;and our aggro rotation;;
themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:25 PM;but healer queues are so much faster than DPS queues;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;tank queues are fast too;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;that's why I played tank;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:25 PM;that and I was tired of bad tanks;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:26 PM;tank/healer queues were instantaneous when i last played;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:26 PM;because it just seems like people are stuck in the mentality that tanks shouldn't ever use offensice stance unless they're soloing;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:26 PM;";v";;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:26 PM;i made so much gil queueing people for DF lmao;;
themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:26 PM;"yeah, the longest i had to wait for a healer queue was 5 minutes";;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:26 PM;i think only really bad players or people super new to XIV think that;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:27 PM;offensive*;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:28 PM;haha but i've definitely had people chastise me for casting stone because they dont understand that you dont have to spam heal people in that game;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:28 PM;so frustrating;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:29 PM;"first and foremost is learning your role and doing that effectively, but the game is designed so that is super easy to pick up";;
themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:29 PM;"I'm the oposite, sometimes i'm to focused on my DPS that i forget to heal the tank 😂";;

themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:30 PM;and as AST I always leave lightspeed for such an ocations;;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:30 PM;Healer is the worst;;

Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:30 PM;"Because as a Healer you have to worry about your aggro, you have to worry about your MP, you have to worry about people standing in stupid, you have to worry about your DPS, you have to worry about your overhealing";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:31 PM;DPS is just;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:31 PM;"it takes some practice and knowledge of fights to know just HOW much leeway you're given as a healer, but i think in casual content it's pretty intuitive";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:31 PM;IS MY ROTATION BEING OPTIMIZED;;
themockingguy#6969;29-May-18 01:31 PM;"I hate the mana managment of AST, if you are unlucky and dont get bole, your fucked";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:31 PM;and the same mechanics that everyone else already has to deal with;;
Joie#2226;29-May-18 01:31 PM;"in theory, yeah.XIV spells are enormously potent for the genre";;
Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:31 PM;healing raid content looks stressful;;

Carmine#9363;29-May-18 01:34 PM;I don't need mouse over macros for healing;;

lilvon#5479;29-May-18 01:39 PM;I mean a keyboard will always be better because it has more inputs;;

themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:34 PM;"Black mage, red mege and summoner";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:34 PM;Ooh red mage;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:35 PM;"Ah yeah, all 3 healers are magic based";;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:35 PM;"Scholar, White Mage, and Astrologian are also magic users";;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:35 PM;But just healers;;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:35 PM;Well;;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:35 PM;just;;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:35 PM;"Healers are cool, yo.";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:36 PM;"Which healer job is the uh, best one";;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Jul-18 12:36 PM;Depends on your playstyle;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:36 PM;I kinda wanna learn about the magic jobs before I get started in a while;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Jul-18 12:36 PM;"I personally like summoner more than White mage, but";;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Jul-18 12:36 PM;Yeah;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:36 PM;"You'll learn as you go gen, no need to worry about it before";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:37 PM;Alright 😦;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:37 PM;I don't like summoner... I've never been good with dotting classes and jobs;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:37 PM;"When I played wow, I spec'd destruction for my warlock";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:37 PM;"If I had to pick, well depending on how good these jobs are, I'd go with Summoner so I can make stupid jojokes";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:38 PM;"Astro is the most stressful one of the healers, bc you need to remember to draw/apply cards every 30 seconds on top of keeping everyone alive and do some DPS";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:38 PM;IMO;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:38 PM;Lol;;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:39 PM;Scholar was an AFK job for a long time;;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:40 PM;Still the most laid-back of the three;;
Malfred#1000;15-Jul-18 12:40 PM;"Between a healer pet, shields, and a really good AoE heal.";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:41 PM;"Yeah, doesn't have Mana issues bc of aetherflow, heal bot and good aoes";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:41 PM;And is the one with the most DPS abilities I think;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:42 PM;"It has 2 dots, 2 damage ones, bane, energy drain, shadow flare";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:42 PM;3 dots;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:42 PM;Oh yeah;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:42 PM;Miasma 2;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:42 PM;But the last one is applied with an aoe and it's really worth it;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:43 PM;8 damage abilities;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:43 PM;Astro has 4;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:43 PM;How many abilities does the Summoner have;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:43 PM;A ton;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:43 PM;"Astro has 1 dot, one spell, 1 damaging aoe";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:43 PM;Another healing + damaging aoe;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;15-Jul-18 12:44 PM;Define a ton;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:44 PM;And a King card but really random;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:44 PM;The smn rotation is like 15 minutes long;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:44 PM;So it's.... 4 and a half;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:44 PM;Unlike other jobs that the rotation is a couple of minutes long;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:45 PM;White mage as well has 4 and a half;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:45 PM;"Holy for aoe, Assize for aoe healing and damaging, Stone 4, Aero 2 and 3";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:45 PM;Last 2 are dots;;
MajorBroski#8359;15-Jul-18 12:48 PM;"I play as Sum. It's fun, but the wait times 🙄";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:56 PM;"Smn gets more complicated as you level up, rn the rotation is simple";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:56 PM;It's still a lot better than FF11;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:56 PM;"Keep dots up, use aetherflow and damage spells and weave in oGCDs";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 12:57 PM;"But I'm probably getting worse at keeping things in check, like my dots on many targets...";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:57 PM;That's what's bane for;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 12:58 PM;"Hard cast them on one, and then spread it tho the rest";;
MajorBroski#8359;15-Jul-18 01:00 PM;"Miasma, Bio, Break??? Ruin.";;
MajorBroski#8359;15-Jul-18 01:00 PM;Drop in Aetherflow and Energy Drain when needed.;;
MajorBroski#8359;15-Jul-18 01:00 PM;Revive when people die. Obviously.;;
MajorBroski#8359;15-Jul-18 01:00 PM;The heal spell works???;;
MajorBroski#8359;15-Jul-18 01:01 PM;"Yeah, rarely use that.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 01:02 PM;"It works at the beginning, but as you progress, the gap between int and mind increases so much that it's useless";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 01:03 PM;"Under level 50, you still find gears with Mind and Intelligence on it";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 01:03 PM;But above it gets separated;;
lilvon#5479;15-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Hmmm id say Sch is mire stressful than Astro as Sch has to manage a pets position & cooldowns.;;
lilvon#5479;15-Jul-18 01:41 PM;"Imo theirs nothing stressful about the cards. Passing out buffs is fun.  Unlike managing your fairies position, health, CDs, etc. Which at high level play can get pretty hectic on top of DPSing, Shielding, & regular healing";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 01:57 PM;"I'd say the cards are stressful because you have to think on the spot what do you want to do with it, do I want to keep this? Burn this? Also think of the situation and apply cards accordingly. Like most DPS are magic? Arrow, physical or ranged? Spear";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 01:58 PM;"And that every 30 seconds, sometimes less bc of sleeve draw";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 01:59 PM;"And have to stress about mana, I don't have aether flow and energy drain, which regain mana";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 01:59 PM;"Only have lucid dreaming and ewer, and that's a rng thing";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:00 PM;"I meld Piety and Det, personally";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:00 PM;"Also, Lightspeed reduces the cost of your spells";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:01 PM;"I'd say Astro is more stressful and more impactful at times, aoe balance is a net 400% damage boost";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:01 PM;And both Lightspeed and Lucid Dream can get +10 seconds from your other CD;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:01 PM;That's true;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:02 PM;"Forgot the name, the one that adds +10 secs to your cards effects and your current buffs, and can stun enemies";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:02 PM;"Essential dignity, but that only applies to lightspeed";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:02 PM;It cuts the CD by 10 secs;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:03 PM;And it's a 30 second CD so it cuts lightspeed by  40 seconds (I think lightspeed cool down is 120 seconds;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:03 PM;"No, it works with Lucid as well";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:03 PM;No... I don't think so really?;;

Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:07 PM;And it's Celestial Opposition;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:07 PM;"Well yeah, if you use celestial opposition it extends the lucid, but it doesn't cut the cool down";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:08 PM;"And you sacrifice using it on cards, if you haven't used it already";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:08 PM;"What I'm getting at, Mana management is harder on Astro";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:09 PM;Than scholar;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:09 PM;You're not really supposed to be out of mana by the time Celestial is back;;
lilvon#5479;15-Jul-18 02:10 PM;Uh actual healing also requires you to think on the spot & those choices actually matter as the wrong step can be the difference between life & death.;;
lilvon#5479;15-Jul-18 02:11 PM;No one is going to die if you draw spire 5 times in a row. Theirs no stress to it.;;
lilvon#5479;15-Jul-18 02:12 PM;"So astro has its own mana tools like light speed, Ewer, & the cross class Lucid Dreaming.";;
lilvon#5479;15-Jul-18 02:12 PM;I think mana manegement is about the same.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:13 PM;"I meld Piety and Det since I'm not really in static, it helps a lot if you have to be either Noct or Diurnal";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jul-18 02:14 PM;"I'm probably overthinking it then, and definitely need to work on managing my Mana better";;
Baguette Cat#6233;15-Jul-18 02:25 PM;It b(r)oils down mostly to which job you feel the most used to;;

AbroadKew#1016;18-Jul-18 06:32 PM;I think it's their launcher and download method.;;
AbroadKew#1016;18-Jul-18 06:32 PM;The fact that one of the options to fix it is to change settings in Internet Explorer?;;

Malfred#1000;21-Jul-18 11:46 AM;To be fair;;

lilvon#5479;21-Jul-18 04:09 PM;For your level theirs no need for a guide just  do MSQ.;;

Baguette Cat#6233;21-Jul-18 04:32 PM;The dragoon/lancer had a bunch of mid-tank gears;;
Neon_#1876;21-Jul-18 04:58 PM;Hall of Novice was a nice addition;;

Neon_#1876;21-Jul-18 05:34 PM;Hehe I did like the Highlander lore a lot;;
Neon_#1876;21-Jul-18 05:35 PM;I *almost* made a Miqote Keeper;;
Neon_#1876;21-Jul-18 05:35 PM;And then I saw most of the job gear with the tail;;
Neon_#1876;21-Jul-18 05:37 PM;>_> I like the underdog/outcastish races;;

Maximilian#8443;22-Jul-18 01:19 AM;Brand new to this game just started the trial. What are some good resources to learn about it? Also controller or keyboard;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 01:21 AM;The game does a great job of explaining nearly everything you need to know.;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 01:21 AM;At the top left hand corner of the screen is your Main Story Quest(MSQ) tracker;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 01:22 AM;Use it to follow the MSQ & the game will slowly open up teaching you everyrhing you need to know.;;
Maximilian#8443;22-Jul-18 01:26 AM;Thank you!;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 01:28 AM;NP! If theirs anyrhing specific you'd like to ask then feel free.;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 01:28 AM;Did you start on Siren?;;
Maximilian#8443;22-Jul-18 01:29 AM;Is that a server?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:33 AM;There's this really great resource that both Shinji and I used when we started playing;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:33 AM;It's called @lilvon#5479;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:33 AM;Not sure if you've ever heard of it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:34 AM;XIV is separated into datacenters;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:34 AM;Think of them as clusters of servers;;
Maximilian#8443;22-Jul-18 01:34 AM;Oh! I think I chose Primal;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:34 AM;Inside are worlds;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:34 AM;Siren is one of those worlds;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:35 AM;Siren isn't on the Primal datacenter;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:35 AM;It's on Aether;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:35 AM;But iirc you can create one character for each datacenter on the basic sub?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 01:36 AM;"So you could make one on siren whenever you want, or pay to transfer your character";;
Maximilian#8443;22-Jul-18 01:37 AM;Oh okay cool! I'll just make a new one on siren then tomorrow;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;22-Jul-18 03:15 AM;Also because using a controller *SERIOUSLY* gimps you;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 03:58 AM;Even though it's the best implementation of a controller in an mmo;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Jul-18 03:59 AM;It's still not as natural and versatile as a keyboard;;

lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 08:52 AM;Nah Controller dosent Gimp you at all. Of course using a keyboars has more inputs but you can do all content just as easily on controller compared to keyboard.;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 08:52 AM;However if you do decide to use contoller keep a keyboard around to communicate.;;
lilvon#5479;22-Jul-18 08:53 AM;I play on PS4 using controller but have a wireless USB keyboard to type.;;
AbroadKew#1016;22-Jul-18 01:29 PM;I feel like there should be a VO for this cutscene.;;
AbroadKew#1016;22-Jul-18 01:30 PM;There was one with these two dudes earlier but not now?;;
AbroadKew#1016;22-Jul-18 01:30 PM;Is there a way to accidentally disable VO?;;
MajorBroski#8359;22-Jul-18 01:32 PM;No. The game really is limited in VO.;;
MajorBroski#8359;22-Jul-18 01:32 PM;Probably to save space and time. The damn MSQ is about 70 hours long if you actually read through the dialogue. 🙄;;

themockingguy#6969;23-Jul-18 12:52 PM;"The place called gridiania, yes, but the map and area is completly diferent, except for some things they kept";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Jul-18 12:52 PM;I watched a video of how 1.0 gridania and black shroud was;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Jul-18 12:52 PM;and i see why people hated it;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 12:53 PM;Watching a video now;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 12:53 PM;It's the same!;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 12:53 PM;At least the place you come in as an archer is so far.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 12:54 PM;Miounne is in the same place!;;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 12:59 PM;Gridania the town was basically the same;;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 12:59 PM;The Black Shroud was a maze;;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 01:02 PM;And the primary dungeon was..;;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 01:02 PM;A hole in the ground;;
Neon_#1876;23-Jul-18 01:44 PM;xD;;
Neon_#1876;23-Jul-18 01:44 PM;Navigating Limsa was annoying to me back when it first came out but it's still visually my favorite of the three main areas;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Jul-18 01:51 PM;"Also, the marketboards and bells are right next to the aetheryte";;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 02:27 PM;Also it is the best starting area;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:31 PM;I feel like the Shroud is still a maze but then I turn a corner and I'm right next to the place I was expecting to go.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:32 PM;but while I was walking I thought it would be another 5 minutes.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:32 PM;I just kind of am in the places I need to be some times and I don't even realize.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:32 PM;Random question. My only experience with WoW and memory was playing an Undead and being in their spooky little underground city.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:33 PM;It's a fond memory because I thought it was cool but I never stuck with WoW. Is there anything spooky and underground and cool like that in Eoreza?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:33 PM;We have a few dungeons like that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:33 PM;As far as settlements? Not...really.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:34 PM;I mean Undercity was neat and all but it was also visually kind of a mess.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:34 PM;Was it? I only played WoW for maybe an hour. It didn't click with me at the time.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:35 PM;"To be fair, *most* things in WoW were a mess";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:35 PM;It's still largely working on an engine built in 2003 and deployed in 2004;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:35 PM;And hoo boy does it look like it;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:35 PM;It's still chug a lugging along though!;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Jul-18 02:36 PM;Yeah but they've been hemorrhaging users for a while now.;;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 02:39 PM;"As far as settlements go, there are no spooky towns";;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 02:39 PM;There are a couple of haunted style dungeons;;
Malfred#1000;23-Jul-18 02:39 PM;And then you have the Palace of the Dead;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Jul-18 02:42 PM;the area where you meet Hraesvelgr in havensward is kinda spooky imo;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Jul-18 02:43 PM;"But is not spooky in a scray way, more like a eerie way";;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:58 PM;"Yeah, I need to go explore the one I found earlier. One of the MSQ had me go kill some skeletons but I didn't go further than the entrance.";;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:58 PM;I just baited them outside.;;
AbroadKew#1016;23-Jul-18 02:58 PM;Spooky scary stuff!;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:01 PM;It more or less boils down to how westerners and easterners look at what's spooky;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:02 PM;Undercity was clearly created from western pop culture;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:02 PM;"With some gory details, like the undeads themselves";;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:02 PM;Forsaken? I forgot the english name;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:03 PM;Easterners are still far more entrenched in the Spooky in an eerie way;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:03 PM;"So far, we didn't have something like Undercity";;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:04 PM;There are zombies;;
Baguette Cat#6233;23-Jul-18 03:04 PM;"But even then.... well.... you'll see, but they're not like the ghouls, patchwerk, etc";;

themockingguy#6969;01-Aug-18 12:47 PM;The Monster hunter event in FFXIV is on Tuesday next week;;
lilvon#5479;01-Aug-18 12:50 PM;"Yeah, as far as the Monster  Hunter event goes not much of a crew to assemble. You have to be level 70 for it.";;
lilvon#5479;01-Aug-18 12:51 PM;"As far as I know omly people who qualify are you, me & maybe Marah?";;
themockingguy#6969;01-Aug-18 12:51 PM;Cid?;;
themockingguy#6969;01-Aug-18 12:52 PM;"The EX version is 4 person, so it's easier";;
themockingguy#6969;01-Aug-18 12:59 PM;"Sazh has a lvl 70 char, if not i can convince one of my taco speaking friends";;
AbroadKew#1016;01-Aug-18 01:01 PM;"I wanted to play more but then I got hooked on a show, oh no";;
lilvon#5479;01-Aug-18 01:49 PM;"Neat, what show?";;
lilvon#5479;01-Aug-18 01:49 PM;And yeah forgot about Cid! Stefan too!;;
AbroadKew#1016;01-Aug-18 03:21 PM;oRANGE is the new black;;
MajorBroski#8359;01-Aug-18 06:18 PM;I'm level uhhh 41.;;
MajorBroski#8359;01-Aug-18 06:19 PM;Only 4 more weeks and I'll be ready 😂;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:23 PM;"I might have heard wrong, but isn't the event supposed to be permanent like GARO ?";;
themockingguy#6969;01-Aug-18 07:51 PM;It is permanent;;
themockingguy#6969;01-Aug-18 07:51 PM;yeah;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 12:37 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 12:37 AM;Same for its MHW counterpart;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 12:37 AM;Behemoth and Aetheryte chicken will now be permanent parts of MH canon;;

AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 05:29 AM;Bottom right.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 05:30 AM;I even relogged.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 05:39 AM;"Disabled Steam overlay, same. Disabled Discord overlay and renabled Steam overlay, same.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 05:40 AM;"Disabled Steam AND Discord overlay, same.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 05:40 AM;"I run borderless window but tried windowed and full screen, same.";;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:54 AM;@AbroadKew#1016 it's probably an app running on the background;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:56 AM;I disabled every app but GeForce Experience. 😢;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:56 AM;I even updated my drivers with a fresh update today.;;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:57 AM;Send me your start-up list on the Task Manager;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:57 AM;*after this issue;;

Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:57 AM;It's this one;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:57 AM;Oh my god.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:58 AM;It was Geforce Experience.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:58 AM;I disabled instant replay and it went away.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:58 AM;"I exited GeForce experience, no change but it still booted.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:58 AM;So I disabled instant replay and voila.;;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:58 AM;"That doesn't make much sense tbh, it's probably just a coincidence.";;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:58 AM;Glad it's good now;;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:59 AM;"By the way, don't use GeForce Experience.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 06:59 AM;It's nifty.;;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 06:59 AM;The only good use for it is to update your drivers;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 07:00 AM;And instant replay!;;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 07:00 AM;But it's kind of a performance hog and sometimes can even break games;;
Marcello#4574;02-Aug-18 07:00 AM;You can have instant replay with OBS too;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 07:15 AM;"Man, this lady think I want to give her my power of ECHO for a retainer?";;

AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 07:15 AM;"I want a mount, homie.";;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 08:55 AM;You should get a retainer anyway;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 09:05 AM;Is there no way to know if heavy shot is active?;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 09:10 AM;You should see a buff if it is;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 09:16 AM;I know perhaps that it's because I'm new but I am not a big fan of the map system in this game.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 09:17 AM;"But in other news, I spent 1,000 gil in teleportation fees to get a free minion from somebody in Novice Netowkr.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 11:54 AM;Does Quata'a Jomalah hang out on this server?;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 11:54 AM;"He's Diabetus, for some reson he loged out in a dungeon and that makes it seem like he's still online";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 11:55 AM;"Oh, ok.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 11:55 AM;Yeah I was gonna say. He's been online for I feel like 3 days.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:10 PM;Anybody wanna fight Ifrit?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:12 PM;Well I would be alright with it;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:14 PM;"Oh, I can swim out of this area too.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:16 PM;"If you want to tango, I'm in Q for now but I can exit.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:23 PM;Ah I got distracted while writing;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:23 PM;I meant to say...;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:23 PM;I'm alright with it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:24 PM;But I'm 10k km away from my PC atm;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:26 PM;Well I asked in Novice Network and a person volunteered as healer... it made me queue up INSTANTLY.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:26 PM;I waited 5 minutes alone.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:26 PM;He comes? Boom done.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:27 PM;Yeah being a healer is pretty great;;
Thelitedragon#4507;02-Aug-18 12:27 PM;The only problem is the pressure and the guilt that I get when everybody gets wiped even though it's not my fault;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:29 PM;Carry around the head of those fallen.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:30 PM;I didn't get the usual player commendations thing at the end?;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 12:30 PM;But I got my first commendation! :);;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:18 PM;Any advice on grand companies? I see that most in FC are allied with Maelstorn?;;
lilvon#5479;02-Aug-18 01:23 PM;Just choose whichever one has the coolest gear.;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 01:26 PM;Till Sea swallows all!;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:30 PM;Follow up question.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:31 PM;"Any reason to keep all this old gear? If not, does it matter who I sell it to? Is price same at all vendors?";;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:32 PM;"No, there's no reson to, you can sell it to vendors, but for a much lower price, like 10% of the original cost";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:33 PM;Should I use market?;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:33 PM;I don't want to hoard too much.;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:33 PM;"you can, however, keep dungeon gear (the one you get on dugeons chests)  and sell it to you grand company for seals";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:33 PM;Just hired a retainer and got rid of all the crafting crap that I don't plan to use yet.;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:33 PM;you unlock expert deliveries (the one to sell dungeon gear) at certain rank;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:34 PM;you can also keep them if you like how they look;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:34 PM;and use them for glamour;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:34 PM;"but if it's not dungeon gear, or dont care about how it looks. just sell it";;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:35 PM;no body is going to buy it in the market board unless is high quality;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:39 PM;Makes sense. I'll hold on to it for now. I mostly rely on the reccommend gear button anyways so I never see the mess of items.;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 01:41 PM;You can also turn gear with 100% spiritbond into materia;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 01:41 PM;But only after doing a specific story quest;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:41 PM;I did just see that on Google. I did a Materia quest with a goblin but I feel like I can't make materia yet.;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 01:42 PM;I think the quest is part of the level 30-ish story quests;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 01:42 PM;Without being completely sure;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:42 PM;I feel like I am close to the mount quest though.;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:42 PM;"yeah, but itll come to a point where you armory chest will be full and need to trow stuff away";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:43 PM;I'm going to look into this glamour thing you mentioned more tomorrow.;;
themockingguy#6969;02-Aug-18 01:44 PM;And you get the mount quest when you unlock the GC;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:46 PM;I know what GC means.;;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Aug-18 01:46 PM;😎;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;03-Aug-18 06:08 AM;Blue quests unlock things. If you're lower level then this is usually some dungeon or another.;;

AbroadKew#1016;03-Aug-18 07:34 AM;I am betrayed. The lowest level quest for  my company is level 30.;;

Malfred#1000;03-Aug-18 09:13 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;03-Aug-18 09:14 AM;"Grand company leves can only be gotten in one specific town for each GC, and they grant, which ordinary Guildleves do not.";;

AbroadKew#1016;03-Aug-18 09:14 AM;"Yeah, I just finally activated levequests and guildeves. Way overleveld for the starter ones now.";;
AbroadKew#1016;03-Aug-18 09:30 AM;This game is kind of frusturating me with all the information.;;
AbroadKew#1016;03-Aug-18 09:31 AM;And just giving me a circle to walk around in but I can't find whatever a sylph is.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;03-Aug-18 09:31 AM;"yeah its a mouthful, 對不對，阿？";;

AbroadKew#1016;03-Aug-18 09:48 AM;Completely forgetting that you have to go to circle and initiate them.;;
AbroadKew#1016;03-Aug-18 09:49 AM;Despite being told that 10 minutes ago by game.;;

hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:18 PM;I’m still on the fence with this game lol;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;18-Aug-18 07:20 PM;It's the best mmo on the market pretty much;;

hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:22 PM;But yea it seems p good;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:22 PM;But only if you have the full game I’m still playing the f2p version;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:23 PM;Honestly the main quest is boring I’m more interested in side stuff maybe that’s why I’m on the fence;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:23 PM;Cause at this point I kinda have no choice but to do main story;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;18-Aug-18 07:33 PM;"I'm not gonna lie here, the main story up to about Lv40 or Lv45 is ass.";;

hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:39 PM;I guess all the original story missions are old from when the game first came out;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:39 PM;When it was bad;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:39 PM;So I’ll give it a pass for now;;

hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:40 PM;I’m p surprised the game survived after being bad for so long;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:40 PM;It survived long enough to become a decent game;;
hot boy#6161;18-Aug-18 07:40 PM;I guess the ppl kept faith in square Enix and it payed off;;

Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-18 07:42 PM;FF 11 was pretty good;;

FireProne#0537;13-Sep-18 01:14 AM;"Oh I see well that's kind of lame since I wanted to play an elezen mage on the same world my gladiator is on, but I heard you can play any class on 1 character so I guess I can just switch roles on the same character if that's possible.";;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:15 AM;It is;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:15 AM;"Yeah, it's not like some other MMOs where you're stuck on a single class forever";;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:15 AM;"In fact, you can freely switch like.. whenever you want to be honest";;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:16 AM;Just unlock the class by doing a small quest for the receptionist in said class' guild;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:16 AM;I think you unlock that functionality when you beat the level 15 quest for your 1st class;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:17 AM;Then you can swap by equipping the weapon relevant to the class;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:17 AM;"Seems about right, yeah";;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:17 AM;10 or 15;;
FireProne#0537;13-Sep-18 01:18 AM;Oh I see well then if I swap with the weapon would it automatically change the armor too?;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:18 AM;No;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:18 AM;You need to get separate armor specific for the class that you are using;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:19 AM;"A white mage can't equip a paladin's armor, for example";;
FireProne#0537;13-Sep-18 01:19 AM;So basically I'd have to change it one by one;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:19 AM;It will just unequip anything you can't wear as the new class;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:19 AM;There's an automatic equip function;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:19 AM;It equips the best armor that possible;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:19 AM;You can also create class loadouts;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:21 AM;"Every time you unlock a new class, be they DoW/DoM, DoH, or DoL, it will also unlock an extra loadout slot";;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:23 AM;"Disciple of War/Magic, Hand, Land, btw if you don't know";;
FireProne#0537;13-Sep-18 01:23 AM;Oh that's good then;;
FireProne#0537;13-Sep-18 01:23 AM;then that means I can just switch slots instead of having to re-equip everything;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:23 AM;"Yeah, basically";;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:24 AM;That's what I do when I change from Dark Knight to Scholar;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:24 AM;I personally have a loadout for each class;;
Malfred#1000;13-Sep-18 01:25 AM;... But i've also players for a loooooong time;;
FireProne#0537;13-Sep-18 01:25 AM;Also if I buy the full game would it come with a free 30 day sub or would I have to buy the game and then pay the sub?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:26 AM;Its a pain in the ass to organise all of those loadouts;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Sep-18 01:26 AM;The sorting system for loadouts is only manual;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-18 01:33 AM;You can assign them to a hotbar for quick access;;

Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 12:02 PM;Lol what;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 12:02 PM;I wonder how they're gonna manage that one;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 01:57 PM;uh when do quests actually start giving dragoon armor;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 01:57 PM;every story quest just gives mage and tank armor no dragoon armor;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-18 02:00 PM;"They do give melee DPS armor, they group the Melee DPS with the tanks for some reason, it should say Disciples of War";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-18 02:00 PM;"They can be worn by DPS and tanks, but some have Tank stats and other have DPS stats";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-18 02:01 PM;"I wuoldn't worry at lower levels thta much, just grab all the gear that says  Disciples of War";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-18 02:01 PM;And the auto-equip should put it if it's correct for you class;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 02:16 PM;i mean tanks get like actual armor and dragoons cant wear any of it;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 02:17 PM;the option they give us is woolen/hempen shirt and pants every quest;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 02:17 PM;the tanks they get like new gear every time;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 02:17 PM;then dragoon gets another woolen shirt with slightly higher stats lol;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 02:18 PM;"we dont get actual armor, even tho i know the armor exists";;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 02:18 PM;cause ive seen it in market board;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;14-Sep-18 02:19 PM;For now just start wearing DoW armor because it really doesn't matter;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 03:52 PM;The MSQ doesn't really give you the best gear;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 03:53 PM;If you want it then grab it from the market board at 1000x markup;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 03:53 PM;But honestly just play through until you finish the MSQ and then you'll get some nice gear;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:16 PM;Like I just did a dungeon and our tank got a whole new set of armor out of it lol.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 08:16 PM;what;;

Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 08:18 PM;You can equip DoW armor;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 08:18 PM;And lancer armor;;
Thelitedragon#4507;14-Sep-18 08:18 PM;"Actually, you can probably buy it from shops";;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:18 PM;The quests and duties all give armor that conveniently is equippable by everyone but dragoon;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:19 PM;That armor is shit armor;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:19 PM;The tanks get cool looking armor;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:19 PM;For free from all the quests lol;;

hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:20 PM;Like ok;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:20 PM;There’s low lvl dragoon/lancer armor in the player market;;
hot boy#6161;14-Sep-18 08:20 PM;But you can’t even buy it in the normal shop and no quests give it;;

Caius#6568;15-Sep-18 02:22 AM;You start getting Dragoon armour at 45 from the class quests. Unfortunately in HW it does the same in leveling in that you go to shirts and shite again. But towards 58 you get a full armour set again (looks like the tank set but black). SB level gear for dragoon is pretty nice. Most of the decent looking armoured sets for goon come at the caps 50/60/70. But tbh that's the same with all the classes really;;
Caius#6568;15-Sep-18 02:23 AM;When I say dragoon armour at 45 I mean the actual set they show you on the character creator and the intro vision;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Sep-18 02:31 AM;I remember it being the same deal with other classes;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Sep-18 02:31 AM;You get the full sets around 40-45;;
Thelitedragon#4507;15-Sep-18 02:32 AM;I'll keep using Ironworks gear until the end of HW for smn and just use the HQ quest gear for sch;;
Caius#6568;15-Sep-18 02:46 AM;You get all the artifact gear minus the chest piece at 45 and the chest at 50 buts it's just glam stuff by then due to ironworks yeah;;
hot boy#6161;15-Sep-18 03:36 AM;The other classes get full sets way before;;
hot boy#6161;15-Sep-18 03:37 AM;All the story quests give them actual armor;;
hot boy#6161;15-Sep-18 03:37 AM;The armor from the quests just isn’t equipped by dragoon so it’s useless for me;;
Caius#6568;15-Sep-18 03:59 AM;You're getting everything but dragoon stuff?;;
hot boy#6161;15-Sep-18 04:33 AM;yes i have not seen one piece of dragoon armor;;

Izwar Vain#5689;21-Sep-18 04:13 AM;Trying to apply physics to a world driven with magic doesn't really work;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 04:13 AM;:tabata:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;21-Sep-18 04:13 AM;You might as well just ask how Chocobos reproduce;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 04:14 AM;Or how lalafells don't just get stomped by every enemy that is human sized or above;;
Izwar Vain#5689;21-Sep-18 04:15 AM;Or how the hell everybody in the Final Fantasy world has clear perfect skin;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 04:16 AM;If you look into it the way each class uses aether is interesting;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 04:52 AM;ok ok that makes sense;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 04:52 AM;but;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 04:52 AM;give me your best LORE explanation;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 04:52 AM;as to why take fall damage when my character can jump 100 feet in the air 😃;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 04:52 AM;did i slip or something?;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 04:56 AM;It's a mechanic in the game to prevent you from running from enemies by jumping off a cliff. Which is why you can't die from fall damage when you are out of combat.;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 04:59 AM;I guess you could think of aether as a trampoline for DRG;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 05:03 AM;You can jump really high with a trampoline and land fine but remove that trampoline on your fall and you'll break into a mess of bones and stuff;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 05:03 AM;Same thing when you fall off a cliff;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:05 AM;what is stopping my character from using aether when he intentionally walks off a cliff;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:05 AM;(when i make my character walk off a cliff);;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:07 AM;he knows hes going off the cliff;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:07 AM;so he should be able to turn on his plot armor ability;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:07 AM;i mean he should be able to turn on his aether*;;
Izwar Vain#5689;21-Sep-18 05:19 AM;plot armor ability lmao;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 05:39 AM;You're arguing game mechanics vs. lore;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 05:39 AM;In MMOs in particular you often have to separate the two;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:40 AM;Game mechanics need to be explainable with lore ESPECIALLY in MMOs;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:40 AM;Or my immersion is ruined;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 05:40 AM;Can't expect an in-universe explanation for every mechanism or vice versa.;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:40 AM;You can expect that I’m expecting it right now;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 05:41 AM;Nah.;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 05:41 AM;Next patch needs to remove fall damage from dragoon job;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 05:54 AM;Because you're an idiot and you didn't tell them to obviously;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 05:59 AM;Gawsh;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 05:59 AM;Immersion is only for TES games anyway;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:00 AM;Maybe those old first person dungeon crawlers.. Like Might and Magic;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 06:11 AM;You don't get immense immersion from looking at the back of a character for hours on end?;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:18 AM;Oh perspective doesn't really make a difference for my immersion.;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:18 AM;"In fact, in regards to RPing in online games, I prefer having a view of my character.";;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:19 AM;It's just not much of a focus in most RPGs these days;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:19 AM;And especially MMORPGs.;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 06:25 AM;The rp in this game is only as good as the people you rp with I guess;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 06:25 AM;I don't RP myself but I do run a sky pirate themed FC;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:41 AM;I've RPed a few different things;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:43 AM;"Among others an extension of the Limsa fisher guild, based in Bentbranch";;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:44 AM;That was the most fun I had RPing in ARR;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:44 AM;The majority of Balmung memes are true btw.;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:44 AM;At least they were true while I was actively RPing;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 06:46 AM;Ah balmung;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 06:47 AM;That estranged red headed cousin who does weird shit you can never confirm but you hear about from multiple sources;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:49 AM;Initially it was the non-RPers making fun of actual RPers;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 06:50 AM;"But then in retaliation, the actual RPers participated in seriousness.. Which gave birth the to the rumoured monstrosity";;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 06:56 AM;Imma RP as a fountain;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 07:05 AM;Nonono;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 07:05 AM;You're going to RP as fountain Biggs;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 07:06 AM;"Now you need to find a fountain Jessie, a fountain Wedge, and a fountain Cid.";;

Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 12:41 PM;I've heard the rumous;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 12:41 PM;Rumours;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:42 PM;"Also, I wanna address the fall damage thing";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:43 PM;"Okay so, something you have to understand is, lore and flavor must sometimes take a backseat to gameplay in order to make a good game.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:43 PM;Why does the Warrior of Light take fall damage when they can jump dozens of feet in the air? Because it is a video game.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:43 PM;My favorite example to show this is in Magic the Gathering;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:44 PM;Listen;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:44 PM;I know that;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:44 PM;That’s why I asked for a lore specific explanation;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:44 PM;There is none;;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 12:45 PM;Apparently you don't know that lmao;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:45 PM;Some things don't have to be explained by lore because if they were it would be contrived and stupid;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:46 PM;"I.e. why can 15 squirrels take on Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, Scourge of the Multiverse? Because it is a game.";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:46 PM;Metal Gear and Dark Souls do that all the time and they are extremely successful franchises;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:46 PM;“Muh nanomachines”;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:46 PM;“Muh time is convoluted”;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:46 PM;You will notice that MGS4 got panned a lot for that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:47 PM;And MGR:R was also laughed at despite the combat being great;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:47 PM;"But we let them get away with it because it's Hideo Kojima, and Hideo Kojima is an insane person.";;
Caius#6568;21-Sep-18 12:49 PM;He's just being pedantic tbh;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:50 PM;That doesn’t excuse dark souls;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:50 PM;The guy who made that game was actually fixated on having everything in the game be explained by lore;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:50 PM;Just check out the lore explanation for how pvp works;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:50 PM;"I haven't played much dark souls, but from what I experienced, the lore takes a heavy backseat to gameplay.";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:50 PM;It’s fuckin stupid but at least there’s an explanation;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;No one cared tho no backlash;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;And nah the lore is super important in that game;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;It's really not;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;At least to the creator it was;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Nobody plays dark souls for the lore;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;They play it for the testicle-rending difficulty;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:52 PM;I’m talking about Miyazaki the creator;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:52 PM;He has a hard on for lore;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:52 PM;Tbh I think he cares more about lore than the actual gameplay;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:52 PM;"See, that's great, but that's not what I'm on about";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;So square enix should do the same thing;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;"What I'm on about is that, to make a good game, sometimes you have to just let gameplay take the forefront";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;Remove fall damage from dragoon job;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;Make up some bs reason why it happened;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;And no one will say anything;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;That's stupid.;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Doesn’t matter if it’s stupid;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;What matters if if the people respond negatively;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Which the won’t;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Okay I can see you're delusional and there's no convincing you that reality exists;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Goodbye;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:55 PM;for example do you think Riot Games the makers of League of Legends give a shit about whether or not a balance change they make is stupid or not?;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:55 PM;almost every change they make to the game is stupid;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:55 PM;they dont care;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:55 PM;what they care about is whether or not reddit will outrage;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:55 PM;"unless reddit outrages loudly enough, they do not revert stupid changes";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:56 PM;Square should adopt the same design philosophy;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:56 PM;"Y'know, I hear BDO is some kind of ball-bustingly hardcore MMO, that might be more your speed.";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:57 PM;what makes you say that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:57 PM;You're obviously a lore-fiend;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:58 PM;I hear that you actually have to maintain your mount's health or some such;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:58 PM;In line with the lore;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:58 PM;Of reality;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:59 PM;"Since lore is the most important thing in the universe to you, even at the expense of fun or good gameplay, that might be right up your alley.";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:59 PM;sounds like a good game;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 12:59 PM;reminds me MGS3 on the hardest difficulty;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 12:59 PM;Then fuck off to it and let the rest of us have actual fun.;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 01:00 PM;ill check it out;;

Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 01:33 PM;But there'll always be small details that are entirely gameplay-related.;;
Malfred#1000;21-Sep-18 01:33 PM;Which is often solved by fanon.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 01:54 PM;Well what you're playing first and foremost is a game;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 01:54 PM;Yoshi P isn't Miyazaki or Hideo or Matt Merrill or something;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 01:55 PM;"Yes, some games use their lore to explain stuff in weird ways";;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 01:55 PM;"But at the base of it, you're interacting with a flood of ones and zeros";;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 02:47 PM;yeah what i have been saying is that he should try to be miyazaki;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 02:47 PM;sakaguchi rolls in his grave every time a dragoon takes fall damage;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 02:48 PM;this is not the future he envisioned for his franchise;;

Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 02:56 PM;Why should everybody have to Miyazaki's idea of where the line is between realism and practicality?;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 02:57 PM;This guy is just a nutter because he would rather read a book or watch a movie than play a video game;;

hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 02:58 PM;Idk joker why should everyone go to a doctor and get vaccinated instead of relying on your great grandmas anti-smallpox remedy?;;
hot boy#6161;21-Sep-18 02:58 PM;Because vaccines are better!;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 02:58 PM;My great grandma is dead;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 02:58 PM;I would be okay with something like a drg having the ability to target an enemy below him and jump onto it to deal damage to it without taking fall damage;;

Malfred#1000;19-Oct-18 04:04 PM;If you're a stickler for low ping any EU server would likely do;;
Nyre#5829;19-Oct-18 04:04 PM;I was on Moogle but meh;;
Malfred#1000;19-Oct-18 04:05 PM;Try looking at one of the preferred servers;;
Malfred#1000;19-Oct-18 04:07 PM;They're low population servers that SE implement EXP/progression boosts on to get new players to there and old players to migrate there;;
Nyre#5829;19-Oct-18 04:07 PM;Thank you;;

Herculez#6402;26-Oct-18 09:27 PM;"Question that I can't get a proper answer anywhere. Is FFXIV worth it? I've been into MMOs since the prime of Conquer Online and having a Final Fantasy based one seems awesome, but what's really dissuading me is the subscription based model of FFXIV especially after paying a lump sum for the base game + expansions, especially since I know I won't have time to play it 24/7.";;
Herculez#6402;26-Oct-18 09:27 PM;"My question is, how do you guys deal with having to pay a subscription?";;
TheDapperChangeling#2375;26-Oct-18 11:27 PM;"@Herculez#6402  Honestly, I do take breaks, but when I first got into XIV, I played a good solid four months, and that was with time to play 24/7, , It's a damn fine game with a damn fine community";;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:22 AM;"When I have time to commit I pay for one month at a time of the basic sub, but I don't really have time time anymore";;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:22 AM;If you have veteran bonuses the price goes down dramatically;;
Izwar Vain#5689;27-Oct-18 09:22 AM;How much?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:25 AM;Industry standard is 15 bucks a month;;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:25 AM;Entry one is 13;;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:26 AM;"I was wrong about the veteran reward price drop, though, so ignore that part";;
Izwar Vain#5689;27-Oct-18 09:26 AM;Awwww man;;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:29 AM;Yeah it's pretty expensive;;
Thelitedragon#4507;27-Oct-18 09:30 AM;I pay the month then go ham;;
lilvon#5479;01-Nov-18 08:07 PM;"```My question is, how do you guys deal with having to pay a subscription?```, , I Set it to auto-pay & forget about it.";;
lilvon#5479;01-Nov-18 08:09 PM;Seriously tho the cheapest sub is 12.99 a month. If $13 a month is to steep for you then youve more issues to work out than can I play a FF MMO;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;01-Nov-18 08:14 PM;that's roughly the cost of most subscription based services (not just MMOs) for anything;;
Thelitedragon#4507;01-Nov-18 08:15 PM;On that note;;
Thelitedragon#4507;01-Nov-18 08:15 PM;Crunchyroll just raised their Canadian price to 8 dollars a month;;

Thelitedragon#4507;01-Nov-18 08:15 PM;"Industry standard for MMOs is 15 dollars, so the XIV is actually a tiny bit cheaper";;

Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 04:12 AM;I'm scared blue mage is going to be a gimmick class;;
Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 04:12 AM;I hope it's a normal class we can use for end game in Shadow Bringers;;
Malfred#1000;17-Nov-18 04:13 AM;Probably both;;
Malfred#1000;17-Nov-18 04:13 AM;It was a gimmick Class in XI;;
Malfred#1000;17-Nov-18 04:14 AM;But was basically a requirement for certain endgame content;;
Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 10:48 AM;Well I mean it's 50 cap in 4.5;;
Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 10:49 AM;Hopefully for 80 at expac release but not likely;;
Malfred#1000;17-Nov-18 01:12 PM;"Well, yeah.. I imagine that the level increases will be 5 per patch until Shadowbringers";;
Malfred#1000;17-Nov-18 01:13 PM;"Which'd bring BLU to 70, if we get 4 more patches after 4.5 (which we definitely won't)";;
Malfred#1000;17-Nov-18 01:15 PM;"The whole limited class thing, just makes me think that they have story significance to Shadowbringers, and it is a way to gate our access to certain stories that'll tie into Shadowbringers' overall plot";;
Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 06:15 PM;I appreciate the theory but I highly doubt they'd gate it behind relevant expansion content. It's a side thing;;
Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 07:54 PM;Tbh after all the announcements I'm actually kinda hyped;;
Caius#6568;17-Nov-18 07:55 PM;It's going to be it's own thing and that's cool. New content with its own endgame. Unfortunate that it's not useable with other classes (but that give us access to some crazy blue magic that wouldn't be allowed otherwise);;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 04:16 AM;"Seems to be useable only with full premades, which is fine";;
Malfred#1000;18-Nov-18 04:16 AM;"Sounded like they didn't know how to balance it atm, but eventually it'll be possible to use in matchmaking";;
Caius#6568;18-Nov-18 04:26 AM;It seems they didn't want to put it in duty finder due to the nature of the spells;;
Caius#6568;18-Nov-18 04:26 AM;They can learn Death level 5 lol;;

Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 12:39 AM;Here's a spoiler for you;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 12:40 AM;Derplander was originally the player-insert character;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 12:42 AM;"He still is to a certain extent, but all of the trailers are not just showing events that we the players will participate in, but also what Derplander has done in his own world.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;13-Dec-18 01:08 AM;I don't even know who Derplander;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 03:22 AM;Derplander is the main character seen in every FFXIV trailer;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 03:22 AM;"Human male, brown hair";;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 03:22 AM;Incredibly plain;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 03:23 AM;Can't quite decide on his job.;;

Izwar Vain#5689;13-Dec-18 03:48 AM;"Ahhh, that guy that people say becomes hotter after every expansion";;
Caius#6568;13-Dec-18 05:26 AM;My favourite is when people say that he's plain and they are a Miq'ote :GWqlabsKek:;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 06:44 AM;That mans been through some shit :trolltabata:;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 07:03 AM;real shit though;;

Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 10:13 AM;I mean;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-18 10:13 AM;Derplander is overwhelmingly plain by design;;
Caius#6568;13-Dec-18 10:32 AM;He's default;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:35 AM;"So since I'm an archer, how would I go about getting the red mage class";;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:35 AM;Or lancer;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:35 AM;idk;;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:37 AM;Red Mage you only need to be lv.50 and have the ARR base story completed.;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Dec-18 10:37 AM;"Lancer class is in gridania, you unlock getting several classes after you complete your lvl 10 (or 15 I forget) job quest for the first time";;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:37 AM;The job itself even starts at lv.50.;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:37 AM;so do I just need to go do the quest over there?;;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:37 AM;Also you must have the Stormblood expansion purchased.;;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:38 AM;Its lv.10. Your ability to unlock jobs comes from a lv.10 main quest.;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Dec-18 10:38 AM;"Yeah, once the game tells you that you can unlock other classes you need to go to the Lancer guild and do the lvl 1 quest";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Dec-18 10:38 AM;Is from the MSQ? Huh it's been awhile;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:39 AM;"Or well, black mage";;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:39 AM;there doesnt seem to be a guild for it in Gridania;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Dec-18 10:40 AM;Black mage is Ul'dah;;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:40 AM;Its a lv.10 CLASS quest that unlocks the Armory System.;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Dec-18 10:40 AM;And is the thramaturge guild before lvl 30;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Dec-18 10:41 AM;So I wasn't wrong?;;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:41 AM;Ul'dah is Paladin/Monk/Black Mage/Red Mage/Samurai. Gridania is White Mage/Dragoon/Bard. Lima Lominsa is Warrior/Summoner-Scholar/Ninja;;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:42 AM;"Expansion area for Heavensward has Dark Knight, Astrologian, and Machinist.";;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 10:43 AM;"Advanced jobs Red Mage, Samurai, Machinist, Dark Knight, and Astrologian cannot be unlocked until you reach certain points of the main story.";;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:46 AM;ul'dah..guess it's time to take a trip;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Dec-18 10:57 AM;or life you know;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Dec-18 10:57 AM;Teleport?;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:58 AM;Teleport to an area I've never been in;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Dec-18 10:58 AM;Or just go on the airship;;
Inko-chan#1899;13-Dec-18 10:58 AM;Perfect;;
Thelitedragon#4507;13-Dec-18 10:58 AM;"If you're not at the level where you did the MSQ where you go to every city state, then you shouldn't even be considering getting another job anyways";;
Velhart#3113;13-Dec-18 11:19 AM;"You can walk there, but you are better off just getting there through the MSQ.";;

Nieran#1297;16-Dec-18 06:35 PM;A livestream full of update screenshots.;;
Caius#6568;16-Dec-18 07:05 PM;The live letter is something the Devs do. They livestream and give information about the latest content that has yet to be released;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Dec-18 09:00 AM;Why is this Chocobo porter so useless;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Dec-18 09:01 AM;They say many convenient destinations and yet there's only one destination option;;
Thelitedragon#4507;17-Dec-18 09:21 AM;You have to unlock other porters through talking to them;;
Thelitedragon#4507;17-Dec-18 09:21 AM;Idk why you'd use the porters after you unlock your own chocobo though;;
Caius#6568;17-Dec-18 09:23 AM;Yeah you have to have been to the other location at least once;;
Caius#6568;17-Dec-18 09:23 AM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 gatherers/ crafters use them for to and fro, from different leve locations";;
Caius#6568;17-Dec-18 09:24 AM;The movement is automatic on a porter so you can be lazy :GWqlabsKek:;;
Thelitedragon#4507;17-Dec-18 09:26 AM;"Ah, yes, being lazy is something I know very very well";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Dec-18 09:32 AM;"Yeah, the problem is I already unlocked like more than five places already";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Dec-18 09:32 AM;And it still just shows one option;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Dec-18 09:32 AM;So I ended up having to walk all the way;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Dec-18 09:32 AM;How do I get my own chocobo?;;
Caius#6568;17-Dec-18 09:52 AM;Porters only connect to certain other porters;;

Malfred#1000;18-Dec-18 05:45 AM;Most of it is regurgitating info you've gotten already;;
Malfred#1000;18-Dec-18 05:45 AM;And you can always rewatch and re-read a lot of it later on;;

Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:17 AM;Overpower is your best friend;;

Izwar Vain#5689;18-Dec-18 07:21 AM;Does making my enemies not face my allies actually help?;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:21 AM;Yes;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:22 AM;It should 9.8/10 but you -> enemies facing you -> allies;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:22 AM;There are very rare cases when you have them in line with you but that's for certain raid adds;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:22 AM;In actual raids;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:22 AM;You've been doing dungeons;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:23 AM;Enemies can cleave in a frontal cone like your overpower does;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:23 AM;Also some does have positionals to hit that make them do more damage and those positionals are either behind or to the side of an enemy;;
Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:24 AM;Here's a quick guide for basics  @Izwar Vain#5689;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/421131276440043537/524577737793470479/smNx1ZX.jpg;

Caius#6568;18-Dec-18 07:27 AM;But overpower is good for building aggro because it hits in a cone so you can hit a few enemies at once. Keep watch of your tp though because it will eat it fast if you spam it;;

Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 06:32 AM;So paying with crysta is basically paying with psn money??;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 06:32 AM;is it s good idea or should i stick with using a credit card;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 06:36 AM;Credit card?!;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 06:36 AM;Stick with the card;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 06:36 AM;Crysta is a relic from 1.0;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 06:36 AM;The system is shitty and hasn't been update since;;

Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 06:45 AM;and time cards do cost more;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 06:45 AM;Its $30 for 60 days;;

Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 10:40 AM;Wait a minute;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 10:41 AM;Why is there only Stormblood in Steam;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 10:41 AM;What about Heavensward;;
Leon#9542;19-Dec-18 10:42 AM;Stormblood includes Heavensward;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 10:42 AM;Ahh really;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 10:42 AM;I thought they were two separate expansions;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 10:46 AM;They are;;
Leon#9542;19-Dec-18 10:46 AM;"They are. You just can't do Stormblood content without having done Heavensward first, so they just package them together.";;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 10:46 AM;^;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 10:47 AM;Same thing is going to happen with Shadowbringers;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 10:52 AM;"So when Shadowbringers come out, all DLC will be put as one package?";;

Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 10:55 AM;except its more expensive;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 10:55 AM;than just buying Stormblood itself;;

Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:06 AM;...;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:06 AM;Because you said you're poor;;
Caius#6568;19-Dec-18 11:07 AM;Just get arr and buy shadowbringers when it comes out. You'll probably still be in arr then :GWqlabsKek:;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:07 AM;:wakka:;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:07 AM;"Izwar, im about to play a game thats $12 per month, do i sound poor";;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:07 AM;I agree with Caius;;

Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:08 AM;"I dunno, you're the one who said you were broke that one time";;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:09 AM;Im still wondering if its cheaper to pay for 90 days;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:09 AM;its not very clear and im dumb;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:10 AM;What's not very clear?;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:10 AM;It is cheaper to pay for the longer periods;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:10 AM;"I never choose the 30 day option, unless I only plan to play for 30 days";;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:11 AM;Does buying ARR include 30 days?;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:12 AM;yes;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:12 AM;but im wondering;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:12 AM;Am i paying for 90 days or is it $15 every 90 days;;
Caius#6568;19-Dec-18 11:13 AM;It's set to auto renew but you cancel it;;
Caius#6568;19-Dec-18 11:13 AM;So you can buy 90 days and then cancel the renew and you're sub will stop after the 90 days;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:14 AM;how much am i paying tho:TriggeredLightning:;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:14 AM;cause i better be payong 15 bucks for 90 days;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:16 AM;Don't you mean 14?;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:17 AM;idk;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:17 AM;I'm talking about the screenshot you sent;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:17 AM;uh yes then;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:17 AM;i mean 14;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:17 AM;It also says Monthly price;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:18 AM;So the answer to your question is No;;
Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:18 AM;As in you won't be paying 14 bucks for 90 days;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:19 AM;:gen:;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:19 AM;When paying for 90 days you pay 40 USD instead of 45;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:20 AM;"But you pay the 40 when the 90 days begin, not in increments.";;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:20 AM;ah so basically im just paying upfront;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:21 AM;"Yeah, with a slight discount";;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:21 AM;But a discount that quickly racks up;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:22 AM;"Hence why 30 days aren't worth it, unless you only plan on playing 30 days";;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;19-Dec-18 11:22 AM;So basically buying subscription time in bulk?;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:22 AM;Yes;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:22 AM;I'll use the 90 days;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:23 AM;its enough time and not too much as 180 days;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:23 AM;"Should be said, that since you'll get 30 days free when first starting out, your first sub payment will be withdrawn after the first 30 days run out";;

Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:26 AM;"I mean, if you're gonna play all the side quests like you said, is 90 days really enough?";;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:27 AM;i didnt say i was gonna do all of them;;
Inko-chan#1899;19-Dec-18 11:27 AM;i just did some of them because i wanted to;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:34 AM;I mean;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:34 AM;Do the sidequests;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:34 AM;A lot of cool stories hidden there;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:34 AM;Especially the Hildibrand lines;;

Izwar Vain#5689;19-Dec-18 11:38 AM;:hohohohohoho:;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:41 AM;Yeah that's fine;;
Malfred#1000;19-Dec-18 11:41 AM;You can always rewatch and re-read a lot the actual stories in your inn room;;

Izwar Vain#5689;02-Jan-19 11:33 AM;Does HW quests start back at Lv 1?;;
Caius#6568;02-Jan-19 11:36 AM;Nah 50;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Jan-19 11:37 AM;Oh really;;
Izwar Vain#5689;02-Jan-19 11:37 AM;So is HW short?;;
Malfred#1000;02-Jan-19 12:07 PM;Nah;;
Malfred#1000;02-Jan-19 12:07 PM;Levelling is just a bit slower;;
Malfred#1000;02-Jan-19 12:07 PM;HW story should equal 25-30 hours;;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 12:21 PM;MY BROTHER IS A WAR! YES!;;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 12:21 PM;\o/;;
Caius#6568;02-Jan-19 01:07 PM;Well guess I am a father now :GWqlabsSweats:;;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 08:48 PM;@Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 08:48 PM;"So anyway, my XIV character is a Lalafell that survived the War of Magi from the... 5th Astral Era I think?";;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 08:49 PM;"And... he's a pretty accomplished Black Mage student... back in the day. Now, he has to start all over, to re-learn both the world, and the knowledge in his Soul Crystal.";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;02-Jan-19 08:49 PM;Ah;;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 08:50 PM;;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/421131276440043537/530216247586062346/glaive1.png;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;02-Jan-19 08:50 PM;Hold on brb;;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 08:50 PM;"Soonish, with the arrival of Blue Magic... he might finally have the weapon he needs to go out in the world, and explore it on his own...";;
Nieran#1297;02-Jan-19 08:57 PM;So yeah...;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 05:27 AM;Went into frontline for the first time in months yesterday;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 05:27 AM;Victory :trolltabata:;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:38 AM;Slowly getting my PLD to 60;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:38 AM;FSH is almost 70;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:38 AM;'bout time too;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 05:45 AM;Finished my mch the other day. Finally got all my combat jobs to 70 now;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 05:45 AM;:GWqlabsSweats:;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:46 AM;I've lagged behind in that regard;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 05:48 AM;Damn that ice dragon in Stone Vigil is tough;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 05:48 AM;Healer died 3 times 😆;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 05:57 AM;Ooof;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 05:58 AM;Stone vigil is the first real difficulty boost;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:59 AM;I'd argue that was Cutter's Cry;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:59 AM;Personally I never had issues with the latter dungeons of ARR;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 05:59 AM;Bar Aurum Vale;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:00 AM;But Aurum Vale is cancer;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:05 AM;Which one is Aurum Vale again;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:05 AM;I just did it today;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:07 AM;Swamp;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:07 AM;Ahhh the one with Malboros;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:07 AM;I didn't really have any problem with that tho;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:07 AM;"At least I, the tank, didn't";;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:07 AM;I dunno cutters cry is still kinda easy;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:08 AM;That ice dragon still gets people in level roulette lol;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:08 AM;If you tank too much at once it can go downhill fast;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:08 AM;That's the only problem with vale I had anyway;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:08 AM;"I didn't have problems with the ice dragon, it was my healer that had trouble with avoiding all the aoes";;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:08 AM;Some people pull that whole swamp weeew;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:09 AM;Oh I'm not saying it's actually hard;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:09 AM;Because it's not;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 06:09 AM;It's just when they start adding more mechs in;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:11 AM;"Lmao, one time this guy was like, Pull all the monsters in and I was like 😰";;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 06:11 AM;Aaaaaand then I died :trolltabata:;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:35 AM;Aurum Vale's issue is the introduction of aggo-less bosses;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:35 AM;Coincounter was terrifying when the game first launched;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:36 AM;These days you can tank through most of his things with the scaling iLevel of the roulette;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:36 AM;Isgebind only has her large AoEs;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:36 AM;Which is much the same;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:37 AM;Unless you play with people who insist on staying in the localised blizzards;;
Malfred#1000;03-Jan-19 06:38 AM;"Cutter's Cry was hard, since you needed to pay attention to the messages displayed";;
Wilechild#2964;03-Jan-19 07:30 AM;Aurum Vale is a garbage dungeon with exceptionally poor enemy placement;;
Wilechild#2964;03-Jan-19 07:32 AM;It’s a pain to tank and heal;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 07:46 AM;You might just be bad :trolltabata:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 08:01 AM;Bad Caius;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 08:27 AM;I was kidding;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 08:27 AM;:sakaguchi:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 09:10 AM;/slap;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 09:11 AM;The Temple of Qarn :sepho:;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 09:11 AM;Why is there 100 mechanics on a Lv35 Dungeon;;
Nieran#1297;03-Jan-19 09:21 AM;Tfw I ran through it as a WHM and had a pretty decent time.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 09:52 AM;The Temple?;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 10:36 AM;I hate that place more than Vale;;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 10:36 AM;It's so boring;;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 10:37 AM;"I mean, thank goodness there was an experienced team mate";;
Izwar Vain#5689;03-Jan-19 10:37 AM;"If not, figuring out all those mechanics would've been tedious :sepho:";;
Caius#6568;03-Jan-19 10:48 AM;Hit stuff until it dies 9/10 :trolltabata:;;
