Dinoken2#0946;05-Mar-17 10:48 AM;He lets you go back in time and side quest/grind;;
Dinoken2#0946;05-Mar-17 10:49 AM;Are you at the point where you only have the shitty ring and sword?;;

DuskNocturne★ ☆#8326;05-Mar-17 10:51 AM;you can run to the save;;
DuskNocturne★ ☆#8326;05-Mar-17 10:51 AM;I don't understand how people reach the end game without being high level;;

Orphy#9935;06-Mar-17 02:13 AM;7.5 for me;;
Aqua#1555;07-Mar-17 03:48 AM;I would give it a Lena Dunham out of 10;;
HayleeLOL#0964;07-Mar-17 05:03 AM;Side note: I always get her and Lena Headey confused;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:01 PM;Hey everyone;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:02 PM;"I didn't play a lot of ffs... but all of them that I played, featured genocide";;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:02 PM;Does every FF have a genocide theme to it?;;
JealousBass#4260;09-Mar-17 09:03 PM;"1 nah, 2 kinda, 3 no, 4 yea?, 5 no, 6 yes?";;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:03 PM;"I played VI, IX and X";;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:03 PM;VI genocide on the espers;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:03 PM;IX on the rat people;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:03 PM;X throughout the game;;
JealousBass#4260;09-Mar-17 09:04 PM;2 has genocide throughout the game too;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:04 PM;Hm;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:05 PM;"It's just that this, along with summons, materia, cid and other things seems to be what defines final fantasy to me lol";;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:05 PM;Of course I haven't played all of them;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:05 PM;But it's a recurring theme;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Mar-17 09:06 PM;how was materia reoccuring?;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:06 PM;I mean;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:06 PM;spell names;;
Skeith#7991;09-Mar-17 09:06 PM;like the usual fire fira firaga;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Mar-17 09:06 PM;oh;;
Crab#6594;09-Mar-17 09:29 PM;13 had the purge so i guess that counts;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;09-Mar-17 09:31 PM;"I suppose, but it wasn't really the theme of the game";;
Crab#6594;09-Mar-17 09:39 PM;true;;
pabl0___#3081;09-Mar-17 09:59 PM;Genocide is probably circumstantial.;;
pabl0___#3081;09-Mar-17 09:59 PM;Any world devouring/destroying villains plans will probably entail some sort of genocide.;;
Crab#6594;10-Mar-17 12:58 AM;whaaaaaaaaat;;
Crab#6594;10-Mar-17 12:59 AM;they brought back shelke for WoFF?!;;
Bloo#5786;10-Mar-17 01:59 PM;But no FFII/FFXII/FFXIV : );;
Bloo#5786;10-Mar-17 02:00 PM;I guess ffxii with Balthier dlc but ehhhhh;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:49 PM;So does anyone here find Woff's story really intersting?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 09:51 PM;I liked it;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:52 PM;Do you have a mic. I wouldnt mind chatting about it in mic channels;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:52 PM;But if you cant its cool either way;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:53 PM;Enna Kros was pretty interesting;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 09:53 PM;"not now I can't, kinda busy with stuff";;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:54 PM;Understood.;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:54 PM;Brb;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:55 PM;Im back;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:55 PM;Anyways what was your thoughts on the villains?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 09:56 PM;"I thought they were interesting, specifically the fact that all 3 are based on summons from older games";;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:57 PM;"Yeah, im curious on if they plan to expand the story. Wish some of the Final Fantasy podcasts would consider doing a spoilercast for Woff as well you know?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 09:58 PM;I don't know if they will continue the story further in future games or works of any kind;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 09:58 PM;it released in such a rough position with FFXV a month away;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 09:58 PM;I wouldn't mind if there was a sequel but it seems like an early anniversary gift type of game;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:59 PM;A lot of plot elements were left unresolved though. And honestly this FF multiverse stuff the game plays with has a ton of potnetial.;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 09:59 PM;The mechaics if expanded on could be really fun.;;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 10:03 PM;And the plot has a lot of intrigue left to go;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 10:06 PM;I was hoping they would add some story dlc at a later point;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Mar-17 10:06 PM;"doesn't seem like it, despite the subtle hints they left";;
Evilord23#8097;11-Mar-17 10:06 PM;Brb;;
Evilord#4688;11-Mar-17 10:11 PM;On my PC account. Anyways I hope that we will get some explanations for the story.;;

Skeith#7991;12-Mar-17 05:14 PM;This floating marcus;;
Skeith#7991;12-Mar-17 07:14 PM;Yo is there a way to go to the evil forest area without the hilda garde?;;
HayleeLOL#0964;13-Mar-17 01:29 AM;"I don't think there is - I never got back there even with it, it's a shame because I always wanted to go back";;
HayleeLOL#0964;13-Mar-17 01:29 AM;"Oh wait you mean the AREA, right?";;
HayleeLOL#0964;13-Mar-17 01:32 AM;Oh.. no there's no way unless you have an airship. It's POSSIBLE you can go back via chocobo - if you get the mountain one;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:39 AM;I mean the area;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:39 AM;Yep;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:39 AM;Odd... I got all 9 chocographs from Chocobo's Forest;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:40 AM;"I have river chocobo and only one chocograph remain to be discovered, which is the one nearby evil forest";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:40 AM;Hmm;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:40 AM;"Oh okay, there's probably other location to find the chocographs...";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 09:40 AM;I'll search for it lol;;
HayleeLOL#0964;13-Mar-17 11:54 AM;"That's strange! Yeah, that chocograph took me a long time to find! Yeah.. I'd suggest searching for it ^^";;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:15 PM;"if you have the river chocobo, then you'll want to find the other chocobo place methinks";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:21 PM;"Yeah, when you get the river chocobo you can access the second chocobo area";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:21 PM;Is in an island;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:21 PM;Is there for river and ocean chocobos (light and dark blue);;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:22 PM;"you can get there from the shoreline near chocobo forest, since Choco will only be able to go through shallow water";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:23 PM;There was a area for mountain chocobos? I cant remember;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:23 PM;I think it was until the golden chocobo the third and final area;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:25 PM;"sadly no, there's just the area for the golden chocobo";;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:25 PM;"but with the mountain chocobo, you can access the higher sides in the chocobo forest";;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:26 PM;"and in chocobo lagoon, you can access the deeper part of the water with the ocean chocobo";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:28 PM;@Aruu#2066 What. I can get there with the River chocobo?;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:28 PM;"I went like, everywhere with it";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:28 PM;Geez.;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:28 PM;yeah! you can definitely get to chocobo lagoon with the river chocobo;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;Damn.;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;you just kind of go around the islands and you can end up there;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;I'll search it.;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;I'm trying to do everything without a guide;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;good! that's the best way of doing it;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;"Yeah, disappointed I didn't search better! haha";;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;awwww;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;I knew there was another chocobo place;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;Just thought I wouldn't get there until disk 3 or so;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:29 PM;if I recall you can do it from the one of the shorelines near Chocobo Forest;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:30 PM;Hmm;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:30 PM;well in that general area;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:30 PM;Yah I'll try there;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:30 PM;Thanks a lot : );;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:30 PM;you're welcome! good luck!;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:32 PM;"I don't think thats true, I remember landing with a ship on a long island where there was chocobo tracks and from there you can get to the lagoon";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:33 PM;"That's how I remember accessing it anyway, maybe theres a second entrance";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:34 PM;"If you have the ship, you can look around and is a pretty obvious cave-like entrance";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:57 PM;What  you're describing looks like a chocograph location actually;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:57 PM;... oh gosh maybe it IS when you get the ship. in that case it's not until disc 2;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:57 PM;O shit;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:57 PM;It's disk 3 then;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:57 PM;I'll search it today lol;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:58 PM;I didn't think it was that late in the game. ahh sorry! false information there;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 12:58 PM;Yeah actually is their way of pointing you towards the new area;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:58 PM;With the ship I stopped in a long island;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:59 PM;"Got the chocobo, then managed to get one of the chocographs nearby the forgotten continent";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:59 PM;Now the last chocograph missing from chocobo's forest is the one nearby evil forest;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:59 PM;Which is why I asked if I should've found the lagoon by now;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:59 PM;oh I know the one you mean;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 12:59 PM;"I think I've gotten it fairly early on, but you do need the red chocobo to get there";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 12:59 PM;Hmm;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:00 PM;"Yeah, you can see it from above when you leave Alexandria";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:00 PM;But that's in disk 3 already;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:00 PM;"If you say you got early on, then you got it without the ship";;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:00 PM;You only get the ship on disk 3;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 01:00 PM;You should be able to get to all the areas by now.;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;"No, you can't access that area with the ship. I mean the water one";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;The disk 4 is basically the last area and final bosses;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;Not the flying;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;I mean I think I found it in Chocobo forest. The chocograph that asks you to go by the river;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;Oh yes;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;It's from chocobo forest.;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 01:01 PM;and I think it was one of the first few I found there;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;I think I like this sidequest way too much;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;One of the reasons I played through was just so I could continue it;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;Is the best;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;Yeah;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;Is the way to access the optional boss;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;"Ozma, right?";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 01:03 PM;Is HARD i warn you;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 01:04 PM;Yes;;
Aruu#2066;13-Mar-17 01:04 PM;you need the golden chocobo for it;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 01:04 PM;I read that you can skip a lot of disk 3 if you level up your chocobo lol;;

Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 01:20 PM;And the story of it fits too;;
fine and dandy#9438;13-Mar-17 01:23 PM;Let me get this straight;;
fine and dandy#9438;13-Mar-17 01:23 PM;Reynn and lann are literally the villains of WoFF;;
fine and dandy#9438;13-Mar-17 01:23 PM;Okay was not expecting that;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 01:44 PM;Really?   I haven't played that much of WoFF but that seemed like the obvious twist;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 01:58 PM;That's not true;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 01:59 PM;Lann and Reynn caused the real antagonists to be able to get into Grymoire by opening the gate to another dimension;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 01:59 PM;It wasn't really done with any bad intentions;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 01:59 PM;they were greedy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 01:59 PM;and their entire plan backfired;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:00 PM;Oh.  Man that's really disappointing.  I was hoping for a KotOR like revelation.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:02 PM;so basically the destruction of the world happened because they wanted all of the mirages to themselves and used their own family to get it but things ended up going south;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:02 PM;Then they end up making the same mistake again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:03 PM;by being tricked into opening up the gate which let all of the robot monster demon things in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:03 PM;since Enna erased their memory temporarily I guess;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:05 PM;"I see, I see.  Well that's not nearly as interesting as them being the villains but memory wiped and on the side of good now.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:05 PM;it's like a;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:06 PM;be careful what you ask for type of story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:06 PM;if that makes sense;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 02:06 PM;What's that from;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:06 PM;WoFF;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 02:06 PM;Oh WoFF;;
Skeith#7991;13-Mar-17 02:06 PM;Lol I didn't even know that had a story;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:07 PM;"I see.  They were too greedy and wanted power, but it backfired.  So they wanted a second chance, but that backfired again, so the story is their third chance?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:07 PM;well they were kind of given a second chance by Enna Kros;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:07 PM;that's where the game starts off;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:08 PM;near the end they get tricked into opening the gate again as they thought it would help save Grymoire;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:08 PM;this is why the game technically has two endings but you get to see both in one playthrough;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:09 PM;first ending is basically Lann freezing himself and the main bad guy(forgot his name) forever;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:09 PM;Mom and Dad died too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:09 PM;Tama died for some reason?????;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:09 PM;and evolved;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:10 PM;"she uses all of her lives to reverse time and give Reynn another chance to save her family and save the world, since the original plan did neither";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:12 PM;Ah I see. Does the game loop back to the begining or just back to before Lann sacrifised himself?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:13 PM;before the final dungeon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:13 PM;but things are a bit different;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:13 PM;Noctis is Sauron!;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:13 PM;HE HAS THE ONE RING;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:13 PM;It makes sense;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:13 PM;Lann doesn't remember Tama since she sacrificed her lives;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:14 PM;Serafie pretends to not remember either;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:14 PM;but she knew what happened and just went along with it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:14 PM;at that point you get Serafie as a mirage;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:15 PM;the new plan is to collect powerful mirages and clear out the demon robots from Grymoire before going to face the final bosses;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:15 PM;"the powerful mirages are pretty much the summons, Ifrit, Ramuh, Bahamut etc....";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:16 PM;it's weird because iirc you have to do this but they literally have nothing to do with what happens in the good ending story arc at all;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:16 PM;ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:17 PM;the sidequests have interesting scenes attached to them but that part is pointless;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:18 PM;oh and you can get Tama back during this part of the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:18 PM;just have to find another life for her;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:19 PM;So they cannonized not being strong enough to beat the final boss and having to go grind and side quest?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:19 PM;Sorta;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:19 PM;the gathering more mirages part makes little sense;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:20 PM;but the rest does;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:20 PM;hey how about we actually think about what we're doing first;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:20 PM;how about we actually try to save the world the right way rather than just rushing in with no plan;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:22 PM;"because it wasn't really that they weren't strong enough, Lann was able to beat him by using the same trick he did on his step sister(yes there's a 3rd sibling) which caused this mess";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 02:24 PM;"I see, I see.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:32 PM;"Yeah, I enjoyed the story a lot and the game itself";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:32 PM;funny thing though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:33 PM;"similar to FFXV, this game has another did they really die kind of ending";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:33 PM;since in the good ending lann and reynn go inside the gate as well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:33 PM;yet;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:33 PM;I for real thought Noctis would live and end up with Iris;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:34 PM;there's a cutscene where Enna Kros brings them back as mirages(?);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:34 PM;and that's where post game starts (but not much to do tbh);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:35 PM;it is up to debate on whether these are the real twins or not;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:41 PM;Iris was a glorified KH character;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:41 PM;lol;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:44 PM;I liked her more than Luna though;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:45 PM;still brings tears to my eyes;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:46 PM;they're giving it monster truck tires for some reason lmao;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 02:47 PM;I think they're tweaking that just a bit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:48 PM;I hope so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 02:48 PM;it looks so out of place;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 03:40 PM;like this alternate personality;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 03:40 PM;but looks like Serah;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 03:41 PM;in reality what you got was this weak little girl;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 03:42 PM;"and just like Lightning, she was afraid of being left alone in the Chaos";;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:19 PM;The original had Chaos being Garland and time looping.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:19 PM;Didn't really play II;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:19 PM;III had Cloud of Darkness as the main baddie instead of Xande;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:19 PM;"IV had Cecil being a Lunarian, Golbez's brother and also Golbez isn't the main villain.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:20 PM;V had Galuf's death and the two worlds are actually one bit.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:20 PM;I could spoil the whole series if need be.;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:30 PM;Isn't Garland the same from 1 and Mobius?;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 04:31 PM;he is Garland but it isn't the same person;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 04:31 PM;Mobius is like a reboot of FF1;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 04:31 PM;its Garland is supposed to be a knight from another world;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 04:32 PM;and the narrator doesn't like him for whatever reason;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 04:32 PM;idk if it has been explained yet;;

Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:36 PM;"Actually, what FF game has the most complex fighting system?";;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:36 PM;1 is pretty easy.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:37 PM;Probably XII.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:38 PM;Considering some of the actual strategy is to overload the engine with particle effects to prevent certain attacks from going off.;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:38 PM;11 and 14 plays as any MMORPG? right?;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:38 PM;"Yeah, technically I guess they would be the most complex then.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:38 PM;I always forget about XI and XIV because I never played them.;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:39 PM;"Same, they are online and monthly fee";;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:39 PM;How much is it for 14?;;

Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 04:43 PM;I played tons of TOR when went F2P;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 04:52 PM;I played for the first month since it was free for that long after buying the game;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Mar-17 04:55 PM;MMOs are tough to maintain interest in if you're not actively playing with friends in my opinion.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:09 PM;I will play them as long as they can keep the ball rolling;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:10 PM;and it seems like I will have to get used to them since nowadays everyone is making open world games;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:13 PM;just for the purpose of adding hours of play time;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:15 PM;they've turned a nice genre into a fad;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:15 PM;"There are games and mechanics that benefit from OW, some are better left out as linear stories";;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:15 PM;I think they wanted to make Mirror's Edge open BECAUSE;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:16 PM;Parkour wherever you want sounds fun;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:16 PM;"They should make a parkour game but like Tony Hawk games, where you get these weird missions";;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:16 PM;and parkour in this tiny map or like Skate 3;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:17 PM;"I can see that, but they did it poorly";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:17 PM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg0Nbfzo_00;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:18 PM;this guy can explain it better than i can;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:19 PM;"I know, I saw a reviewer from my country and calling it the most disappointing games he played in this year";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:21 PM;atleast horizon did good;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:21 PM;still have to find time to play it lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Mar-17 05:22 PM;it might be the last OW I play for awhile though;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:31 PM;"@Grey Watcher#0412  ME:C is not really that bad, i think the story bits are good, the OW was bad";;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:32 PM;"Gameplay looks ok, maybe plot";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:32 PM;I've played trought 3 missions of the story;;
Grey Watcher#0412;13-Mar-17 05:32 PM;"OW was made bad, really";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:32 PM;And they are great;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Mar-17 05:32 PM;I wish i could fast travel to them but oh well;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;13-Mar-17 09:59 PM;Would more summons ruin the lore of FFXV?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;14-Mar-17 10:14 PM;I'm happy that I decided to do the fire mountain before ice cave;;
Desert Stream~#1192;14-Mar-17 10:20 PM;NVM THIS IS HARD;;
Desert Stream~#1192;14-Mar-17 10:23 PM;oh I did it;;

themockingguy#6969;15-Mar-17 11:26 AM;Took me a while to find the airship;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Mar-17 11:28 AM;I hate that there is a point where the game purposely restricts your landing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Mar-17 11:29 AM;and forces you to walk a long distance to get to a required area;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Mar-17 11:29 AM;"then walk all of the way back ;_;";;

NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:24 AM;so what is Vivi's backstory;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:24 AM;I think I might have forgotten;;
HayleeLOL#0964;16-Mar-17 10:25 AM;At work at the moment I'll tell you shortly 😃;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:25 AM;NP;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:25 AM;take your time;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:25 AM;Dinoken might explain;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:25 AM;also I am on disc 3;;
Dinoken2#0946;16-Mar-17 10:27 AM;"Vivi was the prototype for the Black Mage soldiers made by Kuja.  After it turned out he was a success, Kuja threw him out where he was found by Quan (his grandpa) who found that Vivi did not taste good so decided to raise him instead.  Eventually Quan passed away and Vivi stumbled across tickets to the play in Alexandria which is where his story begins.";;
Dinoken2#0946;16-Mar-17 10:29 AM;"And with that I have to go to work myself, so I'll be on later tonight";;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:29 AM;OK NP;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:29 AM;Please;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;16-Mar-17 10:29 AM;but what's the sad part?;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:38 AM;"Just finished XV, and just started a New Game plus...";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:38 AM;All I gotta say is... damn;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:38 AM;you didn't do any of the post game content?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:38 AM;that's worth more than ng+ since nothing changes;;
themockingguy#6969;16-Mar-17 11:39 AM;^;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:39 AM;"No, I wanted to do the story over again because I started playing this game before updating it to the latest version";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:39 AM;oh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:39 AM;well I mean the updates didn't change much about the story;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:40 AM;"Yeah, so I haven't seen the new cutsenes from before chapter 9";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:40 AM;the initial day one patch added CGI from Kingsglaive;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:40 AM;and;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:40 AM;Omen trailer;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:40 AM;ah;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:42 AM;"Still though, as far as shocks go, I would say Chapter 13 does a pretty good job of shocking me, what with Prompto being an MT and Ardyn being... Whatever his familial relation to Noct is";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:49 AM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:50 AM;personally I liked the survival horror take;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:50 AM;I just wasn't a fan of hour long it was;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 11:51 AM;like it dragged on towards the end because they obviously ran out of ideas outside of jumpscares and stuff;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:54 AM;Yeah I was annoyed at how many jumpscares there were in that chapter;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:54 AM;Especially because I enjoy situational and atmospheric horror over the jumpscare kind;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 11:58 AM;"Though, the parts with the Emperor were some of my favorites. Like, you have this guy that's like 20 levels below you that has so much HP that you can barely put a scratch on him. Truthfully though, it wasn't a twist I didn't see coming. I sort of already suspected that that was him after like the second encounter.";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 12:02 PM;"Aside from that, the reveal of Luna being the woman on the logo had me like: Ohhhh, that's who that woman was.";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 12:03 PM;I honestly thought it was just a random woman up until the reveal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 12:40 PM;Lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Mar-17 12:41 PM;I liked how they added noctis to the logo;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 12:48 PM;"Yeah, me too, it also seemed a bit tacked on by comparison";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 02:53 PM;Something I just realized about Final Fantasy XV: Ardyn actually got everything he wanted;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 02:54 PM;"I mean, he wanted both vengeance and death, and he got both in the end";;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;16-Mar-17 02:56 PM;"The Vengeance wasn't truly his, since the end of the Oracle and King bloodlines were pretty much Bahamut's plans";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 02:59 PM;"That may be true, but he still got it in the end. He himself ended the Oracle bloodline, and forced Noctis' hand in taking both their lives";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 02:59 PM;Thus ending the Lucis Caelam bloodline;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;16-Mar-17 03:00 PM;I kinda wish there were more Astrals though;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;16-Mar-17 03:01 PM;"Like the game never said there were only 6, just 6 that have revealed themselves";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:02 PM;"I kinda wanted that too, but it also kind of fits with what Leviathan was raging about";;
mlahk7#8009;16-Mar-17 03:03 PM;I wish they had secret summons that you could obtain by doing dungeons;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:04 PM;"More specifically, she questioned Luna by saying: What do you know of creation?!";;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;16-Mar-17 03:04 PM;So that you could use Ramuh more;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:05 PM;I find it kind of funny how Ramuh never speaks to the player;;
Dr. Spock Me Amadeus#0713;16-Mar-17 03:05 PM;Yet most used summon;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:05 PM;Yeah;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:06 PM;"Meanwhile, I have yet to summon Titan of my own free will";;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:06 PM;He just appears in the trial of Leviathan in a cutscene;;
Davkilla101#0932;16-Mar-17 03:08 PM;"Gotta admit though, Ramuh's summon looks awesome every time";;
fine and dandy#9438;16-Mar-17 05:22 PM;technically there is a secret summo;;

Crab#6594;17-Mar-17 03:04 AM;Are you able to check Serafie's head at the end of the game? Cause she keeps trying to make me start the final boss and I just want the item;;
WildOne#4589;17-Mar-17 09:49 PM;"Quick question about 13 - is there a point of no return?  I'm at chapter 11, and I want to just plow through to the rest of the game before I do all my gil/CP farming for achievements.  Want to make sure I don't miss anything that would hinder my 100% completion.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Mar-17 09:51 PM;if you're waiting until Chapter 11 to worry about that then you may be too late;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Mar-17 09:52 PM;The all items achievement is missable even early on;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Mar-17 09:53 PM;you can come back to Gran Pulse in Chapter 13 later on before the final boss;;
WildOne#4589;17-Mar-17 10:04 PM;"Okay, thanks!  I'll consult a guide and pray that I didn't miss any treasure along the way so far then.";;
Desert Stream~#1192;17-Mar-17 10:06 PM;well you could always restart :p;;
Desert Stream~#1192;17-Mar-17 10:07 PM;restarting is unfourtunatly common in the life of a completionist;;
WildOne#4589;17-Mar-17 10:36 PM;"yeah, I will restart after I beat the game if I have to, but I think I'm in the clear since I have all the elemental rings I can get so far, and I haven't sold a single thing yet either";;

NinjaSaizo#0025;21-Mar-17 04:15 PM;NO worries;;
NinjaSaizo#0025;21-Mar-17 04:16 PM;I just think FFVII is the best';;

NinjaSaizo#0025;21-Mar-17 04:16 PM;with my opinion;;

dins#7172;22-Mar-17 11:08 AM;You don't have to hunt for it really;;
dins#7172;22-Mar-17 11:09 AM;Some people can get it relatively quickly on a first playthrough;;
dins#7172;22-Mar-17 11:09 AM;but you have to get to that point very quickly;;

Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 02:46 PM;i guess i play underleveled but it's odd that it's never an issue until right at the end;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 02:51 PM;Probably because the final boss is usually what really tests your skills;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 02:55 PM;Necron is a real pain in IX because he likes to hit your entire party with every status effect in the game at once;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 02:56 PM;There's a lot of RNG BS in that fight that can cause even a max level party to lose;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 02:59 PM;There are steps you can take to minimize it and being a higher level helps really for the AP to equip as many anti-status effect abilities as possible;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:00 PM;Yeah I'm doing that now;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:00 PM;But the super bad breath like attack makes the fight harder than it should be;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:00 PM;Going to try again;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:01 PM;Yeah it Insta-killed three of my party last time;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:01 PM;Bunch of bs;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:01 PM;Also don't equip auto regen or auto potion incase you get hit with zombie;;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:01 PM;^^^^;;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:01 PM;That got me on one of my playtroughs;;

Davkilla101#0932;22-Mar-17 03:02 PM;I'm suddenly reminded of that boss in XV that's in that dungeon that's in the blockade to Insomnia. That damn thing also tries to give you like every status effect in the game;;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:02 PM;"We got someone that dislikes IX story guys, , GET THE PITCHFORKS -----E";;

themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:03 PM;@Dinoken2#0946 De-mod this heathen;;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:03 PM;Kappa;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:03 PM;There are two fan theories as to what the hell Necron is.  One is that he is the anti crystal and Kuja's actions woke him up.  The other is that he is the true form if the Iifa Tree that the party was unable to kill before because it exists in the spirit realm;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:03 PM;Ah;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:04 PM;The game doesn't really make it clear;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:04 PM;Both are fan speculation because the game doesn't explain shit;;
Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 03:04 PM;He's just... there;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:04 PM;Yeah.  Game should've ended with Kuja;;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:04 PM;"Yeah, i can agree to that, the final boss is a little odd";;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:04 PM;But the final boss music is dope as shit;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:06 PM;I think they made Trance Kuja too easy and instead of buffing him they decided to add another boss after.  Or they wanted a multi phase boss like VII and VIII had and couldn't think of a reason for it.  Or or there was an explanation for what he is but it got cut at some point and they left the boss fight in for some reason;;
themockingguy#6969;22-Mar-17 03:09 PM;"Well it is kinda explained, kuja breaks the cristal of life (or whatever) and they're fighting him to get the world back";;

Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 03:35 PM;There are only two FF endings that made me cry.  IX was one of them with X being the obvious other;;

Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 04:00 PM;not all of them;;

Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 04:01 PM;how did vivi reproduce...?;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 04:03 PM;Fan theory is he used the machines under Dali to convert the remaining mist into black mages;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 04:04 PM;Also the text during the ending was Vivi's good bye letter to the party before he stopped;;

Deleted User#0000;22-Mar-17 05:32 PM;Reading it like that it does seem more obvious it's Vivi;;
Dinoken2#0946;22-Mar-17 06:00 PM;I didn't realize it was Vivi till I read that it was online.  I assumed it was whatever character they were showing at the time saying the lines that appeared with them.  It confused me greatly because the lines don't fit Quina or Amarant but I never thought about it till I read that it was Vivi;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 07:33 AM;"apparently it's made more obvious in Japanese; the way the user speaks is in a way that's very unique to how Vivi speaks";;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Mar-17 10:56 AM;"Honestly, Ardyn has got to be my favorite villain in all of Final Fantasy so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBhk410YpU";;
HayleeLOL#0964;23-Mar-17 02:05 PM;That sounds a lot like Vivi;;
HayleeLOL#0964;23-Mar-17 02:05 PM;just by reading it there;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 02:07 PM;I think it is Vivi. He's the only one not to show up;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 02:12 PM;"I never realised until later, after reading that again online";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 02:13 PM;That made me die a little inside;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 02:15 PM;then just imagine Zidane finding out. since he and Vivi were pretty close come the end of it;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 02:19 PM;why u do dis to me 😢;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 02:20 PM;"misery loves company, muwahha";;
Dinoken2#0946;23-Mar-17 03:50 PM;Poor Zidane... well that's what he gets for letting everyone think he was dead for a year.;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 03:57 PM;yeah why he couldn't send a message through mogmail.. all in the name of drama;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:06 PM;"Where was he btw, in the lifa tree hanging out with kuja?";;
Dinoken2#0946;23-Mar-17 04:13 PM;I think he escaped that probably thanks to Kuja and then just hung out with Tantalus;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 04:13 PM;see I think he was recovering in the black mage village;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:15 PM;That would be kind of a dick move tbh;;
Dinoken2#0946;23-Mar-17 04:15 PM;That would be my second guess.  He probably wanted to spend some time with Mikoto and the genomes;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:15 PM;Like he's worrying the whole party how he is;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:16 PM;A letter or something;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:16 PM;Dagger and company could visit him and shit;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:16 PM;But that would mean a less dramatic ending;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:16 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 04:17 PM;"or he's too unwell to contact them, and it's only when he's recovered that he rushes back";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:17 PM;"And, if he was in the black mage village, vivi would have seen him";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:18 PM;and would make no sense for the letter;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:18 PM;He would have left a copy for him there is it not?;;
Aruu#2066;23-Mar-17 04:19 PM;unless the letter is for everyone else? and Zidane knows/was there when it happened;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:20 PM;"That would be less sad for vivi & zidane, at least he was with his friend when se stoped";;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:22 PM;But i like to think he was hanging out with kuja in the lifa tree;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 04:22 PM;I saw somewhere a theory that thats when he was summoned for the disidia story;;
Dinoken2#0946;23-Mar-17 04:44 PM;I think the Dissidia story is non cannon to the individual games.  Too many characters seem to have forgotten or not had the development they went through in their actual games;;
themockingguy#6969;23-Mar-17 05:46 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:16 PM;ardyn was kinda crap by the end of the game;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:17 PM;just devolved into another omnipresent force;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:17 PM;i was hoping he'd be a good guy when i first saw him;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:17 PM;I liked ardyn;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:18 PM;though it was pretty obvious who he was when you met him;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:21 PM;but then he just turned into this weird telepathic force thing that just talked to you constantly by the end;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:22 PM;It was inside of his fortress;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:22 PM;clearly was an intercom or something;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:23 PM;regardless in practice it was just a bit lame and typical we've all seen it before;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:23 PM;we've seen a lot of stuff before in gaming;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:24 PM;what difference does it make lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:24 PM;there's nothing wrong with how he was in the end;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:24 PM;"He wants to... End the Lucis Caelum line, but only when Noctis is powerful enough? Huh? And he's also a Caelum himself?";;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:25 PM;The second half of the game was rushed and didn't align properly with the start;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:25 PM;yes it was although;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:26 PM;it was the only part that actually had a decent plotline so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:26 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:26 PM;Overall it's probably my favourite beside X and XII;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:26 PM;but some parts just didn't make sense lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:26 PM;I put it at 4th or 5th;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:27 PM;I loved the heck out of the combat and ascension/skills;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:28 PM;"4 party members, each with a specialised weapon and role is great";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:31 PM;isn't that like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:31 PM;standard for most FF games;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:31 PM;not rlly;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:31 PM;3 + 5 had a job system and 6 onwards had more than 4;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:32 PM;and only 3 available at one time besides 9;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:32 PM;I'm talking about specialized weapon part;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:32 PM;eeh it varies;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:32 PM;like noct could use all of them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:32 PM;and they didn't have anything special about them when the others used them;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:33 PM;yeah in FF7 each guy had their own weapon line;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:33 PM;im not sure about the others;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Mar-17 08:34 PM;most of them do;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:34 PM;FF8 didnt even have equipment or magic i think just junctioning;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:34 PM;not sure about that one but junctioning replaced a lot of things;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:34 PM;draw was the worst part though;;
Dinoken2#0946;23-Mar-17 08:49 PM;VIII had weapons you equiped;;
Dinoken2#0946;23-Mar-17 08:49 PM;You could only get them at the synthesis shop though;;
dins#7172;23-Mar-17 08:55 PM;yea you just upgraded them or something;;
待shimLINE_#7673;24-Mar-17 01:50 AM;You could get ultima weapon (Lionheart) disk 1 I believe;;
待shimLINE_#7673;24-Mar-17 01:51 AM;I would like to see a FFVIII remake;;
dins#7172;24-Mar-17 05:06 AM;yeah thats the only thing stopping me from playing FF8;;
dins#7172;24-Mar-17 05:06 AM;if they just touch it up and balance it a little;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:17 PM;So im assuming you're talking about Fang and or Vanille since you asked about age @Desert Stream~#1192;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:18 PM;the reason why they are older than they look is because they were frozen in crystal after completing their previous focus;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 03:18 PM;oh;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 03:18 PM;ok;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:20 PM;In Lightning Returns there's a different reason for that happening but I won't go into that since the reason is part of the point of the game's plot overall;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 03:21 PM;is there a video or post explaining the whole FFXIII lore? Even if people dislike the game(s) I like the lore a lot;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:21 PM;Idk;;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 03:22 PM;I think I remember seeing one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:22 PM;there are books that explain more about the lore iirc;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 03:22 PM;mind sharing the names?;;
Aruu#2066;27-Mar-17 03:23 PM;"not sure how much it goes into the lore, but it explains FFXIII in depth; https://youtu.be/Hteiz_9oCRA";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:24 PM;I think the books were called FF13 Episode Zero;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:24 PM;or something like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:24 PM;even came with audio drama too iirc;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Mar-17 03:24 PM;though that may have been something else;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 03:25 PM;I'll give them a look;;
themockingguy#6969;27-Mar-17 03:25 PM;thanks;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:27 PM;I wonder if Issaru's brothers knew about all the stuff;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:28 PM;in final fantasy x;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:28 PM;that they were all pretty much gonna die;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:30 PM;Also what if you didn't have guardians?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:31 PM;"I guess your mother would die, like Seymour";;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:31 PM;what if you didn't have a mother?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:35 PM;Would your dad die?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:35 PM;"What if you are an orphan, and all your guardians died?";;
Desert Stream~#1192;27-Mar-17 07:35 PM;it's not like you could just... sacrifice yourself?;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 11:16 AM;I think they knew;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 11:16 AM;"Well I'm not sure the youngest brother knew; but the older one definitely would have";;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 11:16 AM;At the time I guess they were going to let the older one give his life;;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:08 PM;"Seymour's mother was his guardian, that's why she was killed.";;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:09 PM;I imagine if you didn't have a guardian or they all died before Zanarkand you were SOL;;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:09 PM;Also based on the reactions of the group I don't think it was commonly known that one of the summoner's guardians became the final Aeon;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:14 PM;"Oh yeah, good point. They knew that the summoner died, but not the guardians";;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:14 PM;Since there would always be at least one Guardian who wouldn't return;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:15 PM;"I guess the remaining ones are sworn to secrecy, and it's assumed the missing one died during the journey.";;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;I can't remember... Does Yunalesca outright state that the guardian takes Sin's place?;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;They become the Final Aeon;;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;I think most people just assumed they died in the final battle against Sin.;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;Who then kills the Summoner;;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;Plus there's only been like 5? High Summoners;;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;So it's not like it happened that often.;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:16 PM;"5 I believe, mhm";;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:17 PM;Yeah and most summoners only have one or two guardians;;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:17 PM;Auron technically died before he could tell the tale;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:17 PM;Yuna was unusual;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:17 PM;"If it's just the two of them, nobody would know";;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:17 PM;Oh good point about Auron;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:18 PM;He was killed.... maybe that happened to anyone else who was there too who threatened to tell what was going on?;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:18 PM;Auron was just the first one to survive;;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:18 PM;yeah he was respected and all and was still known to be around but from his personality i can see why he didnt tell anyone;;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:19 PM;only thing i dont really like about ffx is that they were quick to get rid of the ritual despite not having a concrete backup plan or a solid lead at the moment;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:19 PM;Tis what happens when you have a teenage girl for a summoner;;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:19 PM;"but it doesnt really affect my enjoyment of the whole story as a whole though, still one of my favourite ones";;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:19 PM;haha;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:19 PM;"I don't think they had any choice but to kill Yunalesca, really";;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:19 PM;Since it was them or her;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:20 PM;As sensible it would have been to go We'll explore other options and come back to you if we get nothing;;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:20 PM;Isn't it hinted that she's kind of gone mad?;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:20 PM;"Not sure, been a while since I've played it";;
Aruu#2066;29-Mar-17 01:20 PM;You can't trust something that old or something like that;;
Dinoken2#0946;29-Mar-17 01:22 PM;I think Yunalesca was implied to be 100% devout to the Yevon/Final Summon belief and refused to even accept the possibility of another option;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:22 PM;"And the risk with letting Yuna and co. leave with knowing the truth is that Yevon gets outed for their lies;";;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:23 PM;Mika believed the Final Aeon was the only way;;
Sothangel#5884;29-Mar-17 01:23 PM;He would rather depart for the Farplane than watch Yuna fail and the world succumb to Sin.;;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:41 PM;"Oh yeah, there is a chance that yunalesca wouldnt have let them leave once they knew the truth";;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:41 PM;so they had to make a decision then and there and they decide to say screw tradition;;
ClawViper#4825;29-Mar-17 01:42 PM;great point there;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 01:55 AM;I think he was one of the biggest characters shown since the days of the game being a PS3 game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 01:55 AM;yet this is like the first time we ever see him;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 01:55 AM;well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 01:55 AM;before he became a daemon;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 01:56 AM;in-game at least;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 01:56 AM;He was in Kingsglaive quite a bit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 01:56 AM;"yeah, but it is pretty weird that XV can't explain its own lore";;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 01:57 AM;THere was that one cutscene that had him going all So beautiful... *my* crystal. but that's pretty much it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 01:57 AM;I'm not buying a movie just to know the context of a game;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 01:59 AM;The cutscene in question looks rather dated compared to the other cutscenes in the game. I'm guessing that particular cutscene dates back to Versus;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 01:59 AM;This is the one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aIW9AJfh7A;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:00 AM;luna didn't exist in versus;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:01 AM;and by comparion they were completely different I guess;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 02:01 AM;I meant that the original version of that cutscene must have been from versus. They likely updated it as plot elements were changed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:02 AM;ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:02 AM;idk;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 02:04 AM;Notice how the main characters in that cutscne are of substantially higher quality than the soldiers surrounding them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:06 AM;generic npcs and filler characters tend to be like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:06 AM;atleast in FF games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:08 AM;it was more noticeable with X - XII since saved all of the effort for the ones that you would actually see for more than 5 seconds;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 02:09 AM;"Ah yes, that is a main character. You can tell be the polygons.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:10 AM;in Type 0 it was really out of place in the shorter cutscenes with npcs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:10 AM;especially with the port which made the quality difference between the main cast and the rest of the game even bigger;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;30-Mar-17 02:11 AM;like a half assed mod or something;;
Davkilla101#0932;30-Mar-17 02:13 AM;"Anyways, I should probably focus on FFXII right now, otherwise I'll never make it out of the tutorial mission";;

Davkilla101#0932;02-Apr-17 09:01 PM;At least you haven't spoiled XII for yourself though;;

fine and dandy#9438;02-Apr-17 09:01 PM;thats just you being an idiot at that point.;;
Aryn#9499;02-Apr-17 09:02 PM;the FF fanbase does a good job at just blurting out spoilers;;

fine and dandy#9438;02-Apr-17 09:04 PM;it really isnt that good;;

Skeith#7991;24-Apr-17 08:36 PM;Something subtle like giving a hint that Zidane and Vivi were looking at the crew from somewhere would've still made it fairy tale-ish;;

Skeith#7991;24-Apr-17 08:43 PM;"Maybe one day I will wake up and start doing what I like.

Desert Stream~#1192;02-May-17 08:04 PM;I gotta see them all when I LP it :/;;
Dinoken2#0946;02-May-17 10:05 PM;I think X-2 has three endings;;
Dinoken2#0946;02-May-17 10:07 PM;"If I recall correctly, there's one where you just save the day the end, there's a better ending where Tidus comes back and everyone's happy and there's the best ending which is the same but there's an extra scene between Tidus and Yuna";;
Dinoken2#0946;02-May-17 10:09 PM;I think you need a certain percentage complete to unlock each ending in addition to picking a specific dialogue option at some point where Yuna does the whistle from the first game in the Farplane;;
Dinoken2#0946;02-May-17 10:10 PM;Off the top of my head I can't remember what percentage you need for the good ending or if you need 100% and not like 90% for the true ending;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-May-17 10:14 PM;didn't you have to do something specific at the end of the game to get the ending with Tidus?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-May-17 10:14 PM;like when Yuna is alone;;
Marten#8910;03-May-17 12:02 AM;yeah you have to press a button in the farplane and wait for a whistle or something;;

Chimpy#5375;22-May-17 05:15 PM;"Haha, I haven't played FF7 since it came out to be honest. I actually got my copy from a friend of my father who's house burned down and his copy of FF7 survived";;

Julliant#0001;22-May-17 10:15 PM;"well it's not so bad isn't it, to play the remake almost like you've never played it before";;
Chimpy#5375;22-May-17 11:43 PM;"Maybe, I still want to replay it in the best future";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;01-Jun-17 08:05 AM;there really should be a list of what the best walkthrough is for each game;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:05 PM;yesterday i finished final fantasy ix.;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:05 PM;i'd like to discuss necron.;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 08:06 PM;"sure, haven't managed to get tat far myself yet, but its alright";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:07 PM;how far are you?;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 08:08 PM;"I once got to cleyra, but never finished, I recently restarted and am still digging my life away in chocobo hot and cold";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:10 PM;i didn't bother much with choco hot and cold;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 08:11 PM;gives you some nice loot;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:11 PM;"well, from my experience, you can definitely make it without it";;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 08:12 PM;I already messed up when I didnt manage to steal silver gloves from black waltz 2;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:12 PM;i didn't have any idea about stealing from bosses at that point;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:13 PM;so i just now learned of the silver gloves' existence;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 08:13 PM;"the WT I use told me to steal them, but the waltz was dead before I had the chance, they're rare to get";;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 08:14 PM;and I didnt feel like doing the fight again;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:56 PM;well that sucks.;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 08:56 PM;sorry im late;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 09:03 PM;no probs;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:09 PM;wait what were we talking about initially?;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:09 PM;o right necrom;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:10 PM;so i've seen that there is plenty of hate for necron because he comes out of nowhere;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:11 PM;"and at first i was confused but then i realized that whenever kuja killed the party with ultima, necron was essentially going to take their souls";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:11 PM;i think to understand why necron is there we need to look at what he is;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:12 PM;he claims to be an eternal being whose purpose is to destroy all life;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 09:12 PM;correct;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:12 PM;i guess he is in balance with the crystal;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:12 PM;because the crystal is life and finite and necron is death which is permanent;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:13 PM;so as long as the crystal exists necron continues to exist;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:14 PM;but how exactly did he intend to return everything to a zero world?;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:14 PM;by destroying the crystal?;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:15 PM;"he would cease to exist if he did manage to destroy it, but if that's his purpose then he would fulfill it";;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 09:15 PM;good argumentation;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:15 PM;thanks;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:16 PM;though i have to wonder;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:16 PM;where did he really come from if not from nothingness;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:17 PM;"as in, what was he doing directly before kuja happened";;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 09:17 PM;"in FF, the answer very often is the void";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;14-Jun-17 09:18 PM;yes but in this case it doesn't even make any sense;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 09:18 PM;yeah;;
Thaliel#8969;14-Jun-17 09:20 PM;"mayn, I really wanna continue pklaying IX now";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 07:49 AM;you definitely should. it's fantastic.;;
Trickster#9840;15-Jun-17 11:51 AM;Did you know hades was originally supposed to be the final boss instead of necron;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 11:52 AM;I did! I do wonder why they changed it;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 12:04 PM;necron looks a lot better;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 12:04 PM;they probably would have had to put up with final fantasy worships satan!!!!1 if they went with hades anyways;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Jun-17 12:10 PM;god whoever decided to equate Hades to Satan deserves to be punished;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Jun-17 12:13 PM;"```, they probably would have had to put up with final fantasy worships satan!!!!1 if they went with hades anyways, ```, no they wouldn't";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Jun-17 12:13 PM;no one says anything about that happening in SMT;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Jun-17 12:13 PM;which it does;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 12:13 PM;well ig;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 12:14 PM;i guess maybe they wanted to make a new character??;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 12:15 PM;I guess Hades wouldn't of had the same motivation as Hades perhaps?;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 12:26 PM;what do you mean?;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 12:32 PM;.... wow I messed that up. I meant Hades wouldn't of had the same motivation as Necron;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 12:33 PM;"Necron wanted to bring an end to humanity's suffering, right? That doesn't quite fit what we know of Hades";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:08 PM;that's true;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:09 PM;"While I do feel that Necron is a slight asspull, I also don't think Kuja should have been the final boss.";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:10 PM;having kuja have another form wouldn't make any sense;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:10 PM;that would've been an asspull too;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:10 PM;where the hell would he get the next form? he's already in trance;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:11 PM;I'm not sure who I'd of had for a final boss. Maybe a rogue summon? Or a Trance/remnant of Garland?;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:11 PM;nah not garland;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:12 PM;a rogue summon wouldn't make much sense;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:12 PM;"garland's already dead, and if he was helping zidane then why would he fight the group?";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:12 PM;why would he try to stop kuja and then try to do the exact same thing that kuja tried to do;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:13 PM;in final fantasy tradition the best option is a giant space flea from nowhere;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:14 PM;just like cloud of darkness;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:14 PM;Very good point! Though FFVII was pretty traditional with it's final boss. FFX had the idea right but the actual fight was... odd;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;15-Jun-17 01:15 PM;FFX final boss should've been an extended cutscene;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:15 PM;safer•sephiroth made sense because he was in the process of absorbing the lifestream's energy and becoming a living god and had thus progressed to a new power level;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:16 PM;it just isn't the same case with kuja;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:16 PM;I definitely agree Kuja had his say. But Necron didn't sit right. And yeah.. the FFX final boss just wasn't needed;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:17 PM;"i agree, ffx's final boss was only there to show how weak it was";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:17 PM;"necron kind of makes sense because he's a higher power, which is a traditional final fantasy final boss";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:19 PM;"i mean, you have chaos a god, mateus the god, cloud of darkness from god knows where, a being of pure hate, a being with the power of the void, mad god kefka, safer sephiroth, and then ultimecia";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:19 PM;they're all beings with godlike power;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:20 PM;they're divine and can't die unless someone kills them;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:20 PM;Necron being mentioned beforehand would of helped. Even if it was just a throw away line during the parts about Terra or something.;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:21 PM;they could've mentioned maybe there is a dark entity in the crystal or something;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:21 PM;"you've heard the theory that necron's just a metaphor for death, right";;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:23 PM;"I have! It makes sense, given his role";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:24 PM;they kind of indirectly invoke necron by talking about death over the course of the game. everyone's struggle with death made sense to culminate in overcoming death;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:25 PM;"in that case, by defeating necron (death), who had come for their souls";;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:26 PM;That would make much more sense.;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:31 PM;i certainly think so;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:32 PM;"still, it would help if there were interaction with kuja and necron on the hill of despair or something like that";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:35 PM;"necron should've been more involved in the story at least in some way, i definitely agree";;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:36 PM;"Still, he made for a fun boss fight! And the music is brilliant. Gave me chills";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:42 PM;"yeah, definitely! he screwed me over the first few times because i forgot to equip resistances to the statuses that grand cross dishes out. and the music is freakin great";;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:47 PM;"Yes! I was so unprepared the first time, he used Grand Cross and destroyed me";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:51 PM;his hp to 1 move was absolutely devastating as well. what levels were your party?;;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:52 PM;"The first time? I think I'd of been low fifties. But I didn't quite get abilities, I think I just used auto-regen and the ones like that rather than ones to defend against status effects. Once I'd learned the right way to do it, I was fine!";;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 01:56 PM;"wow, that's really impressive. first time i tried to beat the game, i couldn't make it past deathguise. i must've been in the high forties. i had to do a lot of grinding, and then i had to figure out a strategy for necron. but after i figured them out, trance-kuja and necron were not too hard.";;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 01:58 PM;Trance Kuja is another fun battle too;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 02:00 PM;"haha, flare star on that fight was such a pain";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jun-17 02:01 PM;I liked the frendly battles and the mini quest related to them;;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jun-17 02:01 PM;I wonder what other FF games have the same type of quest;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 02:02 PM;"i don't know of any, but i liked that quest's concept, even if i didn't even finish it";;
Aruu#2066;15-Jun-17 02:02 PM;Super useful to finish it all.;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 02:03 PM;"certainly, when you're up against the circular menace, i suppose you need all the help you can get";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jun-17 02:04 PM;The trivia battle also was fun;;
mimi mentirosa#7007;15-Jun-17 02:04 PM;"i agree, it was a nice surprise when you're out in the open";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jun-17 02:07 PM;"Man, all this talk is making me want to play FF9 again";;
themockingguy#6969;15-Jun-17 02:07 PM;But then i remember i have like 10 games I'm currently playing;;

alp#3140;16-Jun-17 08:07 AM;"im not too far into yet, only about 10 hours";;
alp#3140;16-Jun-17 08:08 AM;but i really like it so far;;
Aruu#2066;16-Jun-17 08:14 AM;fantastic game. I really enjoyed it;;
AeternaR#1067;18-Jun-17 06:31 PM;Me too! Currently on NG+. It's my first Persona/SMT game so I'm looking forward to delve deeper into the series.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 06:32 PM;get into the mainline Megaten games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 06:33 PM;in all honesty they are much better than Persona but Persona gets all of the attention due to the type of games P3 - P5 are;;
AeternaR#1067;18-Jun-17 06:42 PM;Really? Any recommendation on my starter of the Megaten games?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 06:46 PM;SMT Nocturne (totally not because's my favorite);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 06:47 PM;but by all means do play the other Persona games too if you really liked P5;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 06:48 PM;"fair warning, P3 - P5 are a lot different than the first three Persona games, P1, P2IS and P2EP";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Jun-17 06:49 PM;those suffer from the old game syndrome and are more designed like lighthearted versions of the main franchise (even then they're still kinda dark games);;

AeternaR#1067;19-Jun-17 04:19 PM;Ahh thanks! I heard P3 and P4 is pretty good but I found there are other interesting Personas that weren't featured in P5. Various lore indeed.;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jun-17 04:20 PM;P4 is a solid game;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jun-17 04:20 PM;"if you can, play Golden";;
AeternaR#1067;19-Jun-17 04:20 PM;Thanks @Trickster#9840 I'll look up on it soon. Must be that good for it to be someone's favourite.;;
AeternaR#1067;19-Jun-17 04:21 PM;So do I play P4 or P4G first?;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jun-17 04:21 PM;"P4G is an updated version, basically. Better graphics, better storyline, more events, more characters/social links, costumes etc";;
AeternaR#1067;19-Jun-17 04:24 PM;Oh. I thought Golden was a sequel or something. Thanks!;;
Aruu#2066;19-Jun-17 04:25 PM;No worries! I've played both and Golden is definitely the better one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-17 04:30 PM;Golden is also even more easier than the original P4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-17 04:30 PM;Same with P3P when compared to the original;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-17 04:31 PM;"but that's a mixed bag, because the game is not 100% like the original or FES(bonus story) versions";;
Aruu#2066;19-Jun-17 04:32 PM;It is easier because of getting to pass down skills through choice rather than it being random;;

Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:10 AM;😦  I love my VIII.  Probably have the most hours clocked into it.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:11 AM;The game I have most hours in is FFIX. On one playthrough I got everyone up to 99;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:11 AM;Jesus.  How long did that take you?;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:12 AM;I think I was at close to 80 hours? Though I did use the grand dragons method;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:14 AM;"That's a lot of grinding.  I got half of the party in VIII to 100 once, but I used the Island Closest to Hell method and had one person Kamikaze to insta kill the monsters.";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:14 AM;Couldn't tell you how long that took because it was my original PS1 save and I don't know where any of my PS1 games or memory cards are;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:15 AM;"Yeah this was on the PS1, which in many ways makes it more impressive. Since with handhelds and/or Steam you can just watch a movie or something while grinding";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:17 AM;Oh yeah.  Back in the day when grinding was tedious and annoying and you couldn't just watch a youtube video off to the side.  And then we had to walk 15 miles uphill to school.;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:17 AM;But I hate grinding so much;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:17 AM;Being able to distract yourself while doing it nowadays is one of the great things about modern gaming;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:18 AM;"I agree, this is why I really prefer it when RPGs do come out on handhelds. It's just so much easier.";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:20 AM;It's why Pokemon survives as one of the greatest RPGs;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:20 AM;I'm a fan of any RPG that doesn't require full screen or I can play on console so I can pop something on my laptop to watch.;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:20 AM;Or ones that just don't require grinding;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:20 AM;I've heard those exist;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:21 AM;The newer pokemon games are much less grindy at least!;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:23 AM;It's definitely easier to grind with exp share and the exp curve.  But I remember having to grind a lot in Sun/Moon.  Those trial Pokemon were too frustratingly strong.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:24 AM;"Actually, yeah. I had a lot of trouble with the grass one on one playthrough because I had nothing effective against it";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:26 AM;I picked the fire starter so grass wasn't an issue to me.  I remember having a lot of problems with the fire one and the ghost one was the worst.  That damn Mimyku with its Play Rough;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:27 AM;I remember that one scaring the hell out of me. Turning around to see that damn Mimyku staring at me;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:30 AM;"Heh, I remember being frustrated by having to move the 3DS and then on my like 6th attempt realized I could use the joystick.  But that trial made me catch a Mimikyu because I was so impressed with how it destroyed me.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:33 AM;"I had one on my final team. Very useful, especially it's ability.";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:34 AM;I had one on my final team too.  It was one of the better Pokemon I ended up with.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:35 AM;"For once, I didn't have a starter on mine. None of them really appealed to me that much.";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:36 AM;My team in Sun/Moon was awful.  I didn't have any special attackers.  But I kept my starter.  I can never bring myself to box them.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:42 AM;I can't usually but it just wasn't useful in the slightest on my team.;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:49 AM;"Which starter did you use?  I thought the grass one looked pretty cool, and the fire one was okay.  If you went water I can understand your choice though.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:50 AM;"I did go water! I tend to, more often than not. Though in other playthroughs I went with grass and fire, and they're actually not bad. That grass/ghost typing...";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:52 AM;I always go fire on my first playthrough.  Fire type is best type after all.  But the grass starter this gen definitely has the best design.  And that type combo was the best.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 08:57 AM;"The grass one is the best one. I do like Litten, not so much his final form.";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 08:59 AM;His final form is too different from the first two.  I had the same problem with the Samurott line in Black/White;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:00 AM;"It also clearly looks like yet another fire/fighting type, when he was supposed to be fire/dark. They could have done so much with that, it seemed like an honest let down.";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:02 AM;"They should've had it stay on all fours and look more like a tiger.  Unless I'm forgetting something, I don't think we have a good tiger Pokemon.  Huge missed oppertunity there, but then this is Nintendo and Game Freak so what else is new.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:03 AM;Not that I can recall off hand! I did enjoy the Alolan forms though. Except Persian. That was... stupid.;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:05 AM;"The Meowth line, the Diglett line, and the Rattata line Alolan forms were garbage";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:05 AM;"But Alolan Golem, Ninetails, and Muk were great.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:06 AM;"I liked Alolan Sandshrew too, but it wasn't outstanding. It looked great, but didn't play all that good for me";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:07 AM;It had a solid design.  I loved Alolan Raichu and wish its stats were just a tad higher.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:11 AM;"I used an Alolan Raichu in my final team! Not amazing, but I just fell in love with it";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:12 AM;It's just so adorable the way it's surfing on its tail!  Plus that type combo is good too!;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:15 AM;And it's happy little face. It's just oh so cute.;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:18 AM;One of my favorites of the Alolan Pokemon.  I'm working on a second playthrough slowly but surely at the moment and I have every intention of using it.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:18 AM;"I'm trying to do that. I rushed through my first one, this one I want to kind of take my time with, smell the flowers, so to speak";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:22 AM;I gotcha.  My goal this time through is to play with a more balanced team.  Last playthrough I had major gaps in type coverage and only had physical attackers which led to a lot of frustration especially in the late game.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 09:23 AM;I'm trying to force myself to use different pokemon. Still Vaporeon still got onto my team somehow...;;
Dinoken2#0946;21-Jun-17 09:25 AM;It's so easy to reuse old favorites.  I have several Lapras and Charizard in my hall of fame boxes in the Pokebank because of this;;
hayley atwell#9740;21-Jun-17 11:34 AM;I love Grinding if the Battle system is Enjoyable;;
hayley atwell#9740;21-Jun-17 11:34 AM;Yesterday i grinded for 5 hours in FFX and i enjoyed every momeny of it;;
Aruu#2066;21-Jun-17 11:35 AM;Yeah FFX is a good one for grinding. The switching out party members helps;;
hayley atwell#9740;21-Jun-17 11:36 AM;Yeah that's the greatest thing about it;;
hayley atwell#9740;21-Jun-17 11:36 AM;I hadn't grinded up to this point so the game started to be pretty hard;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:36 AM;I don't like grinding in any game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:36 AM;it takes away from the experience;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:36 AM;a lot;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:37 AM;"I am generally okay with grinding for exp for money, but if it's my first playthrough grinding for anything else annoys me";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;so in that case I would usually use Cheat Engine as a partial bypass and save the time I do it correctly another time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;the only time I can tolerate the repetitiveness of grinding is if it's some kind of cheap exploit;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;for example gold saucer shit in FFVII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;or oversight by the devs;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;or materia grinding for that matter;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;like FF1's Gigas hallway thing;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;otherwise I'm generally okay with it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;but then again;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:38 AM;I played Runescape;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:39 AM;so even FF grinding seems like kiddy shit by comparison;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:39 AM;"I remember trying to grind some shit in DS3 yesterday, gave up";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:40 AM;drop rates are too low for the shit that you need the most;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:40 AM;"yet using them is cheap af, I would rather it be the other way around tbh";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:41 AM;would gladly sacrifice more souls for infusion over running through the same area 500000 times because the gem has a fucking 30% chance of dropping;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:41 AM;pretty sure there are ways to raise the drop rates in every Dark Souls game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:41 AM;in addition to the initial chance that enemies have to actually use their drops;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:41 AM;you get discovery;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:41 AM;discovery raises the initial drop rates;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:41 AM;but it doesn't raise the individual item drop rates;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:42 AM;two separate things;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Jun-17 11:42 AM;ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:43 AM;"so even if I had for example 200 discovery, the percentage of increase on the initial drop rate doesn't change what the other drops are";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:43 AM;it basically means;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jun-17 11:43 AM;you'll get **something** more often than nothing at all;;

SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:21 PM;The story in my opinion didn't make sense :[;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:21 PM;if they put less effort into all of the extra stuff centered around the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:21 PM;and put that into the game itself;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:22 PM;it would've been much better;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:22 PM;"They should've, i agree";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:22 PM;I got something out of playing it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:22 PM;but it was probably the worst open world game in the genre;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:22 PM;or atleast one of the worst;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:23 PM;Yeah it was pretty bad tbh 😅;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:23 PM;I hate to say it;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:23 PM;I love final fantasy now;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:23 PM;But that game as a whole is disappointing;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:24 PM;"I really enjoyed king's glaive though, that film was amazing";;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:24 PM;Which is why i played ffa 15;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:24 PM;false hype goes a long way;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:24 PM;though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:25 PM;I atleast played WoFF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:25 PM;which came about a month before;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:25 PM;but due to the hype centered around FFXV it didn't get a lot of recognition despite being the better game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;and a nice treat for FF Anniversary;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;Oo im intrigued;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;Whats woFF?;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;What does it stand for;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;World of Final Fantasy;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;Ill go check it out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:26 PM;an early anniversary title featuring cameos from all over the franchise;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:27 PM;it's a kiddy game and very lighthearted but I still really enjoyed it;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:27 PM;"Oh my days, looks so cute";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:27 PM;certainly more than I did with XV;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:27 PM;Yeah i gotta play this too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:27 PM;funny enough I didn't even know about the game until 2 weeks before release;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:28 PM;didn't think much of it because I was focused on XV at the time but then I played the demo;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:28 PM;and by the end of the demo I was already on the PS Store preordering the digital copy lol;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:28 PM;"WoFF is a fun game, but it is definitely a slow burn. If possible, I suggest you pick it up for handheld (Vita) over home console.";;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:28 PM;Lol xD;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:28 PM;Looks cool though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:29 PM;It doesn't matter;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:29 PM;"If you enjoy FF, you will enjoy it. Lots of throwbacks and cute little versions of characters from the series.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:29 PM;but the PS4 version has the luxory of being a lot more stable;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:29 PM;Im new to ff. 😅;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:29 PM;the best part about WoFF is that the game doesn't rely on the cameos to be enjoyable;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:29 PM;"15 is my first ,you see";;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;"I would argue that, while true, it makes the game far better if you know the references/cameos.";;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;Just like with Final Fantasy XIV or Final Fantasy IX.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;well of course;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;FFA?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;but;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;"And im kinda confused, sad and triggered by the story xD";;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;Triggered?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;the game still stands on its own even if you don't get all of the references;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:30 PM;"It does, but I think a lot of the fun is diminished going from a great game to a decent/good game.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:31 PM;I don't see that being the case personally since a new player is only missing out on the signifigance of the references and throwbacks;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:31 PM;it doesn't detract from the story just because you don't get the point of say;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:32 PM;Celes' opera sidequest;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:32 PM;or Rikku's fear of Lightning;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:33 PM;Is final fantasy usually dark?;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:34 PM;"Not really, even the dark parts of the series are littered with light moments and brevity.";;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:34 PM;Because i sorta felt depressed when I finished the bitter sweet ending 😅;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:34 PM;nah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:34 PM;I mean there's some dark moments but it isn't like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:34 PM;SMT or something;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:35 PM;I should really check out the other ff games 🤔;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:35 PM;Theres so much i dont know xD;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:35 PM;Its like a whole new world for me lol;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:35 PM;You should! I definitely suggest you play them in order at this point.;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:35 PM;"The early games are pretty quick and depending on the version you play, pretty easy.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:36 PM;it doesn't matter what order you play them in tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:36 PM;personally I'd recommend X next;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:36 PM;a pretty easy one to get into;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:37 PM;"Plus, when you play through in order, you can see the improvements from one game to the next.";;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:37 PM;"I will check them out ,frens :3";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:37 PM;The first 3 are much harder to enjoy so I tend to not recommend any of those unless you are cool with ancient style rpgs;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:37 PM;"@Claudia#8474 oo thats true, u have a good point";;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:38 PM;Ty for the info frens :];;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:38 PM;"I disagree, they are easy to get into with the updated versions. The 20th Anniversary verisons of both Final Fantasy I and II are pretty easy and understandale.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:38 PM;np;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:38 PM;I think im gonna like it in this server xD;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:39 PM;Final Fantasy III (DS/PC) made the core game far easier than the original.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:39 PM;They suffer from the too old syndrome even in their most recent releases;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:39 PM;like FF1 for example;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:39 PM;is still true to the original despite the changes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:39 PM;its design is not like how the later games in the series are;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:40 PM;or more modern jrpgs in general;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:40 PM;Like how there's very little focus on story and the game is better at letting you explore the world than giving you a well written story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:41 PM;So you have to just do everything by yourself with the game giving you a few hints here or there on what to do next;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:42 PM;Just wondering;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:42 PM;What did u guys think happened in the end?;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:42 PM;"I mean, its open to interpretation";;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:43 PM;This scene in particular;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:43 PM;"Are they both dead, married in the afterlife?";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:43 PM;or their own personal heaven;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:43 PM;Or miraculously resurrected?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:44 PM;no both are 100% dead;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:44 PM;the ring perished;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:45 PM;"this is more or less like I said, a dream, a view of their heaven";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:45 PM;whichever one sounds the nicest I guess;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:45 PM;Thats so tragic;;
SphealWithIt xD#6801;16-Jul-17 03:46 PM;"I really wanted them to have a family;-;";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:46 PM;not really;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:46 PM;I mean they atleast got to be together in the end;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:46 PM;"My view of it was that it was Noctis' final thoughts as he gave his life for the world and his country he loved so dearly. I do not believe that he and Lunafreya met again in the afterlife, but just passed on.";;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:47 PM;"Definitely a bitter ending, but it was one of my favorites of recent memory.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:47 PM;I think it just depends on how you look at it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:48 PM;though there will never be a solid answer as to what actually happened in the end;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:48 PM;so it probably doesn't matter anyway lol;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:48 PM;"...Yes, that is the point of the ending. As Spheal had suggested, its open to interpretation.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:48 PM;I kinda don't like endings like that personally;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:49 PM;just encourages headcanon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 03:49 PM;Rain was like that too if anyone remembers that game;;
Claudia#8474;16-Jul-17 03:50 PM;"Those endings have been a part of the franchise for decades. Heck, the fan favorite FF7 had that exact kind of ending until they did the continuation of the series with Advent children and other ancilliary works.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;16-Jul-17 08:57 PM;"`just encourages headcanon`, , Do you have a problem with headcanon?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:00 PM;yes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:01 PM;because everyone has their own dumbass idea so I typically dislike it when games go that route;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;16-Jul-17 09:01 PM;clearly you've never experienced the magic that is c0da in The Elder Scrolls;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:01 PM;nope;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:02 PM;but I have experienced what happens when fans are left to interpret things in franchises like Touhou;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:02 PM;headcanon is godawful there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:02 PM;(as well as fanfiction but what else is new);;
mrmiffmiff#0666;16-Jul-17 09:03 PM;what about a franchise (TES) where all conflicting accounts of a particular historical event are simultaneously all true and all false?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;16-Jul-17 09:03 PM;trust me when you have a god of time that can be broken things get weird;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:04 PM;idk man I don't know anything about TES lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:04 PM;probably the only time I was ever ok with it was probably with Rain;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:05 PM;only because the appeal of the game was to be super vague like that anyway;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;16-Jul-17 09:05 PM;"nah I'm just kidding around with you, , I agree that in most cases it's not a great thing, , especially since Death of the Author is the dumbest fucking thing ever";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;16-Jul-17 09:05 PM;but for TES I like it because the lore community is actually intelligent;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:06 PM;sounds fun;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;16-Jul-17 09:06 PM;sadly in most of my experiences with it that wasn't the case;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 10:16 PM;Morrowind was the only game where I felt a push to read up on lore and explore the world.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 10:17 PM;Oblivion and Skyrim both push completion of objectives more than just enjoying the atmosphere of the game.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 10:19 PM;"Right out the gate in Morrowind you had a ton of stuff to explore in Seyda Neen if you wanted, but your first story quest is to take a long ass walk to Balmora, and it's hard not to get sidetracked by something.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;16-Jul-17 10:19 PM;"The environment was just so engaging, and the crappy combat almost forced you to explore and be creative.";;

Claudia#8474;26-Jul-17 09:50 PM;I don't believe that to be the case. The game was designed as a fan game and not as a prequel/sequel or canon to any of the main entries. I remember as much being said in an interview.;;
Claudia#8474;26-Jul-17 09:50 PM;Though I am struggling to find the source at the moment.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:07 PM;it really did a number on Yuna but the whole style of the game just feels unsettling;;
Aruu#2066;03-Aug-17 04:07 PM;Yes Yuna was unfortunate;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:07 PM;the combat especially in the international version is the highlight;;
Aruu#2066;03-Aug-17 04:07 PM;There's changing your image and then there's becoming what she did;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:07 PM;and the only reason I care about the game;;
Aruu#2066;03-Aug-17 04:07 PM;"Though I always got the impression she was just trying to copy Rikku, down to how she acts and dresses.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;03-Aug-17 04:08 PM;"I got that too, it was a bit on the nose with it sometimes";;
HayleeLOL#0964;03-Aug-17 04:08 PM;even down to Rikku being like OH HEY IM SUCH A BAD INFLUENCE HA HA;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:08 PM;the whole shuyin/tidus/yuna/lenne thing was confusing since I never actually played but;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:08 PM;I like it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:08 PM;I also feel like the story was a bit extra in regards to the whole FFX universe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:09 PM;"like they were just going on just to go on, and the problems were created out of thin air";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:10 PM;It took a very conclusive ending;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:10 PM;changed it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:10 PM;to fit a plot that really wasn't needed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:10 PM;I don't mind a sequel but time travel? really?;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:10 PM;time travel makes everything better;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:10 PM;then again I have sort of a bias against TT plots;;
HayleeLOL#0964;03-Aug-17 04:11 PM;My summary of FF13-2: wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff.;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:11 PM;except for FF1;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:11 PM;that sucked;;

Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:11 PM;it's kinda annoying;;

Dinoken2#0946;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;Time travel is awful for story telling;;
Aruu#2066;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;Yeah got to admit that aspect of it was annoying;;
HayleeLOL#0964;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;"I think LiS did it well tbh, generally";;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;and the characters were a little cringy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;I don't think it is bad but most implementations of it are;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;but I can't say it was a bad game;;
Desert Stream~#1192;03-Aug-17 04:12 PM;I'd get the sequel/prequel;;

Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:08 PM;Your storyline could be it's own game.  Laguna traveled the world looking for Ellone and we see the end of it and one little side quest.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:08 PM;Nah;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:08 PM;There could also be a sequel prequel about Ultimecia's rise to power.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:08 PM;No prequals cuz 8 has it all explained in the game;;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:08 PM;"Besides, the music...I don't like.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:09 PM;"I mean, it's alright, but...It's not something I'd jam to.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:09 PM;FUCKING SEYMOUR OMNIS' THEME THOUGH.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:09 PM;The only issue is that Ultemicia isnt mentioned much;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:09 PM;But a remake could fix all the issues and add dialogs;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:09 PM;And npcs too;;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:10 PM;Isn't Square planning on a VIII-IX Remake after VII?;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:10 PM;They've hinted that it's a possibility;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:10 PM;And add some scenes to make Ultimicia have a deeper backstory;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:11 PM;No;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:11 PM;In terms of remakes they are planning X-3 then 6 then nobody knows after that;;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;shhhh.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;none of them are planned;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;they were just thrown around;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;as possibilities;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;I don't believe Square has actually said what they're doing after VIIR;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;they never outright said that's what was going to happen;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;SE has ben nudged by many magazine interviewers and web interviewers about a possible 6 game;;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;That's why I stated it as a question.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;I wasn't sure if I was recalling correctly.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:12 PM;they have but it doesn't mean they will go through with it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;"it is an interview, you will get asked the same question 900000 times";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;They havent released anything official on any of the things i said;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;likely won't until it is actually a thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;and the idea gets approved;;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;"FFVII Remake Launch, the fans scream in joy.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;"The screen lits up, new trailer.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;17-Aug-17 10:13 PM;Final Fantasy XIII-4;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;Other than replys to questions in interviews that lead me to feel they are doing it in that order;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;Honestly if that was the case;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;we wouldn't want a remake to end up like MM Legends 3;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;where an unapproved game gets announced;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;I'd have mad respect for Square;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;and then dropped;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;They roll with one of their least popular games because it's what they want to do;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;I wouldn't be happy about it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:14 PM;But I'd accept it.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:16 PM;"So i see it going like this in terms of remakes (my possible predictions) in this order: X3, then something with 6, then another possible game but thats too far into the future";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:17 PM;X-3 doesn't exist so how is that a remake;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:17 PM;....;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:17 PM;That wasnt my point lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:17 PM;Its touching an older game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:18 PM;"```,  i see it going like this in terms of **remakes** (my possible predictions) in this order: **X3**,, ```";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:18 PM;just imagine that there's bold formatting there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:18 PM;👍;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:18 PM;Technical police over here;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:18 PM;yup;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:18 PM;Anyway;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;Thats my predictions;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;What do you guys think?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;tbh as much as I'd love to see VI remade;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;I'd rather get something new;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;I feel like this remake;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;True;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;remaster;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;porting;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:19 PM;bullshit is just playing it safe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;although porting is somewhat reasonable;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;but the other stuff;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;I think we'll see a X-3 at some point as much as I'd rather not.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;I hope they don't go through with it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;I really do;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;leave X alone;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;"But in that prediction, i feel like it will all be spread apart and we may get other new games betwee  the list i gave duh";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:20 PM;All of the post X-2 stuff has been awful.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:21 PM;the entire universe for that game has been blown to pieces;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:21 PM;everytime they add something to it things get worse;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:21 PM;True i agree;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:21 PM;Leave X alone damnit lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:21 PM;X3 is unwanted;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;But too many fans are defending X2 :(;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;Plus X already got a sequel.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;They should just remake IV again.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;NO;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;That's what we all really want.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;NOOO;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;PLS NO;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:22 PM;3D IV was a perfect remake they dont need to touch it ever again;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;if they touch IV again I'm done;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;I feel like IV is Square's safe space.  Whenever they're lost and don't know what to make they go and revist FFIV because it's comfortable to them.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;No;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;it's their favorite game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;"like if someone said, IV could get another sequel";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;I wouldn't even deny it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:23 PM;They made so many remakes cuz it was before they knew how to port a game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:24 PM;because there's more of a possibility of IV getting remade or another sequel than probably anything else lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:24 PM;"I'd rather see V, VI, VIII, or IX revisited next.  None of those games have really been touched aside from ports";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:24 PM;The GBA and PSP remakes from the ground up was because they couldnt port the original all in there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:25 PM;"no more ports, no more remakes";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:25 PM;Please remakes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:25 PM;everyone who should've experienced IV have done so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:25 PM;anyone else;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:25 PM;More remakes please;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:25 PM;tough fucking luck man;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;"I want 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 to be remade little by little over the span of years";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;Not all back to back but here and there;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;I want a reimagining of 1.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;we have that already;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;it's called;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;Mobius Final Fantasy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;and;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;Lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;sucks;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;Mobious is NOT FF 1;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:26 PM;No way;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;"I mean an actual game, not a mobile shoveware title.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;yeah I'd be down;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;"Like you keep the central premise of Garland = Chaos, the 4 fiends, the time loop, and the 4 warriors of light";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;They should pay respects to their first game somehow;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;But you give it an actual story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:27 PM;I hope they design it with more story and stuff;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;It has story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;it needs more;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;"And not just give the Light Warriors a face, a name, and an anime trope like they did with the Onion Knights";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;in place;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;The events in the game are the story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;in the actual game;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:28 PM;Actual characters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:29 PM;actually giving them proper characters would be fine as long as they do something with it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:29 PM;"The game does have a story, I meant a more in depth story along the lines of Square's SNES and later titles.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:29 PM;I can see them still letting you name your heros but adding a mutual town they grew up in or something;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:29 PM;I don't want them to add characters and just say fuck it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:29 PM;Like they did with III?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:29 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:30 PM;sure do love playing as generic NPCs;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:30 PM;Yep.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:30 PM;Whats your opinion  @!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 on what they should do then?;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:30 PM;"In the comments for the character contest on Reddit, somebody asked why I used a generic Onion Knight instead of the Re:III characters for the bracket";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:30 PM;And my response was that they were barely characters.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:31 PM;"add a more fleshed out story, throw in proper cutscenes and events (like they do in other games), don't pad the game with useless content";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:32 PM;profit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:32 PM;as far as combat goes idk;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:32 PM;don't particularly care as long as it is fun;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:32 PM;I have many ideas of differant directions they could take that would still have everything the original had faithfully without a reimagining but add things to strengthen the plot;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:34 PM;Like if the 4 heros were childhood friends in the intro villiage and you name them. Then they pull a dragon quest 3 kinda and let you job them at the local elder who sends them off on a fetch quest to learn the game;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:34 PM;Then they get back and theres a slaughter and they find out it was Garland and leave to go get his ass;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:35 PM;oh I would actually like to see them do something like Tales of Graces did;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:35 PM;Then the plot unfolds staying true to the original but adding to it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:35 PM;Child Arc -> Normal Arc ->Future Arc;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:36 PM;The tales of games are poorly written stories imo;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:36 PM;In my opinion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:36 PM;Half of them do;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:36 PM;as a Tales fan that is somewhat of an accurate observation;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:36 PM;The characters and stories of all those tales of games are all stereotypical anime tropes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:37 PM;The characters are the best part;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:37 PM;especially in Vesperia;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:37 PM;and Berseria;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:37 PM;No originality;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:37 PM;Velvet was like the best jrpg character we've seen in years;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;good god she was the shit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;and the game's story was too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;but mainly because of her;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;Theres not as much depth in tales of to compare it to FF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;yes there is;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;Noooooo;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;Its just a playable anime;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:38 PM;I can tell you as person who's played both a lot;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:39 PM;I played most of them and cringed at the anime stereotypes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:39 PM;they aren't stereotypes;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:39 PM;Didnt get far in any of them cuz i couldnt take it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:39 PM;just because they design them with an anime theme;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:39 PM;Tales of Destiny 2 was the only one i genuinly loved;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:40 PM;Eternia?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:40 PM;or the real ToD2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:40 PM;because the game had to be renamed in the US and that's what they used;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:40 PM;The real PS1 tales of destiny 2 was the most original tales of game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:40 PM;That's Eternia;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:40 PM;or well its real name;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:41 PM;they called it ToD2 because of He Man;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:41 PM;or w/e;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:41 PM;Idk but it was waaaay better of a story and was better written;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:41 PM;yes Eternia is great;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:41 PM;Closest thing to it i can remember is Grandia;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:42 PM;But still thats a huge stretch;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:42 PM;Grandia I didn't care for;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:42 PM;Not a Tales of fan but i understand what they try to do and their fams;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;Its just not FF;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;AT ALL;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;of course it isn't FF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;FF is FF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;but recently FF isn't even FF;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;Not even in the same convo can they be compared;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;Tales of was always the poormans FF imo;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;nah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;not even close;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;they can in terms of consistency though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:43 PM;which is what FF needs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:44 PM;instead of trying to be that one guy that likes to bank in the current meta in the industry;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:45 PM;What FF needs is 50% consistancy but continue with the originality of each solo game but at a 50% instead;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:45 PM;90%;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:45 PM;but stay as far away from copying AAA as possible;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:45 PM;they can't handle it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:45 PM;Ya kinda;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:46 PM;15 and 13 proves your point perfectly;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:46 PM;yes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:46 PM;"as much as I love XIII and the saga, terrible idea";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:46 PM;and you already know how I feel about XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;no more trying to fit in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;they should go back to doing things the right way;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;As far as that im so used to looking at the franchise as a whole but in terms of future releases they need to get their shit together;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;I have my faith that XVI will be good.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;XIII was a blunder;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;I try to keep my hopes up;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:47 PM;but it is hard;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;especially after XV;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;13 was a slap in the face;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;because I was so excited;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;And XV's problem was it was 10 years of development and poorly managed mess because of it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;and then ultimately disappointed;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;13 shouldve had another title instead of FF;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;But XVI shouldn't have the problems of XV.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;so expectations are like ground level for me;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;doesn't get any lower;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;It wouldve ben a great game if it wasnt FF13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;if SE was better managed;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:48 PM;I think XIII was much more traditional FF than XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;the game would've came out;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;Woah!?  @Dinoken2#0946;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;15 waaay more of a FF than 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;the entire company is at fault for XV's shortcomings;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;nah;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;"The hallway sucked, but aside from that it had all the staples of a classic FF game.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;XIII was;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;@Dinoken2#0946 hell no it didnt;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;you can slap a new name on XV;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;15 had waaaaaaaaaaaay more staples than 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:49 PM;and you wouldn't even think this is final fantasy;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:50 PM;15 had NPCs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:50 PM;yes generic NPC roster;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:50 PM;15 had people who sell you stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:50 PM;inside of generic gas station number 10001;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:50 PM;15 had an open world;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:50 PM;"Slightly revamped ATB and leveling system, convolted plot that's poorly presented, well developed characters even if most of them come off as unlikeable, villains who are good villains but have weak motivations, etc.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;thing about XV's open world is that;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;FF hasn't had an open world since IX;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;You cant use 13-2 and 13-3 cuz those are its sequals;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;there's not much to it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;And IX's open world was pretty barren.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;"And like I said, the hallway sucked major ass, but aside from that it's a standard FF.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;the game had about 2 major cities you could visit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;the rest was just landscape;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:51 PM;@Dinoken2#0946 youve lost it lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;Nah.  the lack of locations outside of the Mist Continent is a major flaw of IX.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;Ok so your opinion aside....;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;the combat is also nothing like FF either;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;Whats the biggest complaint about 13???;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;The hallway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;^;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;Nope;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;yeah it is;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:52 PM;Its that its waaay too far from a FF;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;The hallways are just an example people give;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;15 lets you ride chocobos;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;I've never even seen anyone use that as a complaint when talking about that game;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;Has an airship;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;You can ride Chocobos in XIII too;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;XIII also has airships;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:53 PM;^;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;You cant drive an airship in 13;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;"That's true, but you can't really drive one in XV either.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;you can't in XV either;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;You cant ride a chocobo anywere you want;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;you drive a flying car;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;Well I guess you can but it's pointless;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;It gets you to one optional dungeon.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;YOU GET AN AIRSHIP drivable in 15;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;you get;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;a flying car;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;Dungeons;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:54 PM;that's not an airship;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:55 PM;A pointless airship that's just a glorified easter egg.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:55 PM;Non-autobot summons;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:55 PM;Sooooo much more i can list;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:55 PM;You can actually use summons when you want to in XIII though;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:55 PM;And use more than just Ramuh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:55 PM;the summons aren't glorified ok I end the battle now tools;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;They're pointless like they are in every other game.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;15 has its own unique summon system;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;But neat.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;Which is nothing like the other games.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;Many games has its own mechanics;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;there's nothing unique about rng;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:56 PM;Ramuh occurs the most because his conditions are easily met;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;the rest you will barely see;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;Thats not the point tho atleast they arent transformers lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;and the fact that you can't use them when you want is a drag;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;That's just an art style choice though;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;But ruins summons;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;I don't think so;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;no it doesn't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:57 PM;Odin was the shit in XIII;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:58 PM;It makes the summons more personal.  Which is just a different take on them.  If you're allowing XV's version of summons to be passable you have to allow for XIII's;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:58 PM;You guys like 13 so dont let that deter you from the point of our convo that 13 is farther from FF than 15 by MIIIIILES;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:58 PM;Oh I hate XIII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:58 PM;that has nothing to do with it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:58 PM;With a passion.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:59 PM;I enjoyed XV for the most part.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:59 PM;stop trying to use personal feelings to aid your point;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 10:59 PM;But XIII is a FF game.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:59 PM;I noticed you guys using personal feelings lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 10:59 PM;I only said facts;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 10:59 PM;all I said was that odin was the shit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:00 PM;but even the stuff before that was said without any personal views on both;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:00 PM;Anyway;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:00 PM;13 is obviously farther from all the FF games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:00 PM;You've still yet to say why you think otherwise though;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:00 PM;Its why everyone hated 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;it isn't though;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;It is;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;"Everyone hated XIII because they didn't understand the combat system, the characters were unlikable, and the hallway sucked.";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;Not that it wasn't a true FF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;that's pretty much it;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;People don't like XV for that reason;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:01 PM;Nope;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:02 PM;Lol ok i can see we dont agree and thats fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:02 PM;you aren't even trying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:02 PM;to prove your point;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:02 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:02 PM;Huh?;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:02 PM;I proved many points;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;you won't go into detail on the parts of XV you think are more FF like than XIII;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;"Open map, summons, airship, chocobos, hallways, ect";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;and all you do is try to shoot down Dino's points;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;using stuff like that's not why people disliked the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;and other stuff that doesn't really matter in all honesty;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;I said tons of points;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;this isn't about we don't want to agree with you;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:03 PM;"Open map, summons, airship, chocobos, hallways, ect";;

Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:04 PM;I listed all the things 15 and most other great FF games have;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:04 PM;That 13 didnt;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:04 PM;There are waaay more;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:05 PM;But its all above in our convo;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:05 PM;"FF hasn't really had open maps for a while though, and the summons are more FF-like in XIII even if the art style is a little different.

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:07 PM;XIII had multiple cities even if you were forced through them due to the game's overpowering linearity and hallway like nature;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:08 PM;XIII had a more fleshed out story which wasn't put on the bench to cater to sidequesting for half of the game before ultimately rushing the second half;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:08 PM;The Chocobros were much more likeable overall but you really don't know anything about them until you pay for Square's $5 DLC;;

Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:10 PM;"I think XV's story is mostly fine, it's just Square is god awful at presenting their storylines in an easily understandable fashion.  It's why the Ultimanias exist.";;

The summons are robots and thats NOT like FF at all (mechanics aside), the airship in 15 takes you to anywere on the map your in (regardless of it having a plot purpose), you cant ride chocobos freely in 13 so whats the point?, the hallways issue and NPCs and shops and all that stuff is a HUGE important problem and betrayal.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:12 PM;then lets add the fact that you use them like consumable grenades;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:16 PM;"Then the environments, XIII's environments while being hallways were always well designed. If there's any part they did right about the game it is this. They're colorful, they have specific themes, the artists actually put a lot of effort into making them look unique and fantasy-like. XV's environments on the other hand are pretty bland, Liede is pretty terrible just empty desert, Duscae is mostly forest and wildlife, Clienge is probably the best of them all for Lucis and Altissia is the only area in the game that looks like the artists were able to use their creativity to the fullest. Altissia is beautiful but why couldn't the rest of the game have this much effort put into them?";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:20 PM;while still explaining my points;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:20 PM;Its alright;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:20 PM;Il start from here to be fair XIII did not have open maps but XV's maps are not FF like at all;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:24 PM;"XII was a hybrid between X's kind-of-hallway system and the more open world maps of the previous games.  It was a welcome change from X, but it still wasn't really open world.  It was a good compromise and I hope they go back to it for XVI instead of going full hallway like they did in XIII or bland empty openish world like they did in XV.  The point still remains that the worlds weren't really open so while the hallway is awful and isn't the direction Square should've gone with it's not something that's entirely different from the rest of the franchise.  The summons aren't robots, they look like robots.  It's an artistic choice.  They still function like traditional summons in the series, unlike XV's.  Just because they went with a different art style doesn't mean it's too different from the rest of the franchise.  XII didn't even use the normal summons!  XV's summon system was completely different and is a much bigger departure from the franchise than XIII's art choices.  The airships in previous titles were *important* you needed them to get to places.  The Lunar Whale took you to the moon, Ragnarok's weapon systems were needed to get into Lunatic Pandora, you have to take the Strahl to get to the Pharos.  XIII only had airships in the story, not flyable ones so I'll give you that, but XV's airship barely counts.  It's a pointless easter egg that's barely drivable (unless they patched the controls, I haven't played XV since I beat it shortly after it came out).  And again, the hallway was fucking awful.  But I wouldn't say it was a betrayal.  There were hints of the hallway in previous titles and the hallway fit the theme of what they wanted for the story (a band of fugitives constantly on the run, not having time to stop and explore).  Again, it's an awful idea but I wouldn't say it makes XIII not a true FF";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:32 PM;Also this is all just defending XIII.  XV has soooo many issues that seperate it from the rest of the franchise.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:33 PM;XV should've stayed a spin off;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:33 PM;"15s maps arent like FF at all cuz every FF has a new map (they have maps unlike 13) in each game. The lack of  content of the map in 15 is a flaw i admit BUT it has a map like FF does. 13 had like 1 city (that festival place) but you cant do the same thing in that city as any simple gas station in 15 can. 13 had an extremely confusing story (la'cie, lo'cie, la'crae, la'idfk) with characters we watched instead of feeling any substance or compasion for (Lightnings a bitch to everyone and never changes her personality). idk about 13 dlc but as far as characters in both 15 and 13 we cant include in this convo cuz to be fair on both games every FF has a unique cast......";;

She's even a hardass in LR even though her LR self is nothing like her XIII self but that's just irrelevant to the topic at hand so I'll leave it at that";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:45 PM;"13s combat is tricky and unique like many of the later FF game's systems but technically so is 15 too so that entire section is out the window. 15s entire spell system and casting are unfortunately unique and stand alone in 15. The environments in 13.......you mean awesomely detailed designed hallways? Still hallways tho rite? Lol the theme and entire look of 13 was farther from FF than 15 cuz it lacks any and every organic apeal or structured apeal with everything being like a far future type of theme. 15s enviroment is simple a large field of monsters like other FF games have, PLUS the structures look organic like an actual NPC man that lived in that world built it unlike 13s look thats too perfectly structured to believe. The artists put TONS of details into both games so that debate on wich had more detail is kinda equal since 13s world just had more structures to look at unlike 15s detailed world that didnt have as much to look at but thats more of a complaint about 15 rather than it being more FF.....";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:47 PM;XIII's combat being tricky has nothing to do with how far away it is from FF;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:47 PM;When i add a ... that means im not done theres more;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:47 PM;it is still essentially ATB;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:47 PM;which is a common system;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:48 PM;so even though it is different;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:48 PM;Im doing this in order of how you posted it above;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:48 PM;it is still closer than XV's realtime system;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:49 PM;Actually i countered all your points uptill my last post;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:49 PM;Im done now lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:49 PM;"Also prior to XV half of the main series games used ATB, 4 used traditional turn based, 2 were MMOs and 1 was MMO-like.  None of which were real time.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:49 PM;Gimme a sec to read what you guys posted while i was responding;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:49 PM;You can't use XV having real time mechanics as just being it's gimick when it's drastically different from the rest of the franchise.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:50 PM;"The maps being hallways is not an important part in the point I was trying to make, the fact of the matter is that XIII's enviornments have more detail and have more fantasy-like areas than XV.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:50 PM;Plz try to match my points with the points yourself made;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:50 PM;we are;;

Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:53 PM;Ok so as far as XVs gimmick mechanics in battle vs 13s gimmick mechanics?  @Dinoken2#0946  we cant debate that cuz every FF tries something new with its battle system;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:53 PM;this is an area from the Duscae region;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;like at the differences in how they were designed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;the creativity one has;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;that the other lacks;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;But that's not true to the extent you're claiming;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;Whyd you show that road pic of 15 lmao;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;About the battle system;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;"XIII is a twist on the ATB, which half the games use";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;ok well find me a picture of Duscae;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;Wow that was not equal comparison;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;XV is something completely new that *none* of the games have used.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;that's more forest;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:54 PM;since I couldn't find any;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:55 PM;I'll let you find the comparison image if you think I'm not being fair;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:55 PM;Theres an entire forest jungle section in the upper left of the map;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:55 PM;Its your point bro not mine lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Aug-17 11:56 PM;@Dinoken2#0946 the atb system in 13 is 100% new tho;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:56 PM;this is the closest image I can find that is inside of the forest in duscae;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Aug-17 11:57 PM;But it's nowhere near as different as XV.  It's still ATB.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Aug-17 11:57 PM;how is that not equal?;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:03 AM;Myrlwood is the games forest/jungle type area as im sure that the place you showed me in that 13 pic was just an area only;;

Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:08 AM;Well in the end me and you guys just have differant views on what FF is;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:08 AM;....in general apearantly;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:08 AM;And thats ok;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:09 AM;Not sure if ive shown you another fair perspective in my points but i hope i did;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:12 AM;"The point is that you prove what you say in the discussion, if you can't then you can't. It's all good, you just have to bring stronger evidence next time. But if you want to drop then sure, since that's what it seems like based on your response";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:12 AM;idk;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:12 AM;I've said what I had to on the matter;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:12 AM;I feel quite the opposite lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:12 AM;I feel all your points have be  countered effectivly;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:13 AM;I proved everything both of you said wrong in your same order;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:13 AM;I don't think you have bud;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:14 AM;But in the ending i try to back off and not force my pov on you guys;;

Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:14 AM;Lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:14 AM;or Dino's point about XIII being closer because it has ATB;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:14 AM;which is a common system in FF games;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:15 AM;To be fair 15 has its flaws;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:15 AM;I never said it has EVERYTHING closer to FF but it in general is closer;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:16 AM;The flaws 15 has dont compromise the point im making tho;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:17 AM;"thing is, we've given multiple reasons as to why XIII was closer I don't see how you believe your points won over ours tbh";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:17 AM;Its all above;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:17 AM;I specificly countered every point;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:18 AM;the only one I'd say you even remotely have against us is the whole linear vs open world thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:18 AM;the rest;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:18 AM;include the last two I mentioned were debunked;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:18 AM;The liniar open world thing is a huuuuuge part of the opposition i noticed;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:19 AM;It all constantly comes back to that in some form or another;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:19 AM;yeah but that's the only real point you have;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:19 AM;unless you're trying to say that open vs linear is the only deciding factor;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:19 AM;or the major deciding factor;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:20 AM;Nah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:20 AM;which that in itself would be completely wrong;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:20 AM;Ya see people say 10 had hallways too but thats far from the truth;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:20 AM;...well not that far....;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:21 AM;"yes, X had hallways but no one has ever debated whether or not X was far from the games that came before it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:21 AM;because it was not;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:21 AM;But 10 had connecting areas in a structure that allows for every area to be connected thru loading screens to make its map;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:21 AM;despite the linearity it had many things that still line up with what FF is about;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:21 AM;13 was just hallways all the time only;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:21 AM;"Oh, no, not this XIII thing again...";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:22 AM;Yup;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:22 AM;you missed it dude;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:22 AM;Lol;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:22 AM;"I shouldn't even be here, just peeked for a few seconds and saw '13' lol";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:22 AM;Im telling him 13 is waaaaaaaaaay farther from an FF game than 15 (even tho their both far lol);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:23 AM;this is the anti-climatic end where laguna somehow still believes he won the discussion about which whether or not XIII or XV is closer to the FF franchise;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:23 AM;I wouldn't say XIII isn't a FF game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:23 AM;even after giving multiple points of reference;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:23 AM;Even IV was mostly linear;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:23 AM;You gave me a list of reasons and points and i in the same order countered all of them in the same way you sent them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:23 AM;like how XIII's combat is still ATB;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:24 AM;while XV's is realtime;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:24 AM;"Even though XIII was my first FF game, I can still feel it on the older games";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:24 AM;and not command based at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:24 AM;no battle transitions like the previous titles;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:24 AM;So as i said erlier most FF games try unique combat;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:25 AM;thing is;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:25 AM;XIII is still closer than XV;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:25 AM;15 doesnt win the atb debate but everything else does;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:25 AM;ok lets bring up environments again;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:25 AM;"I don't know where you two are trying to get too, so let me ask you both a question";;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:25 AM;What is the FF series all about?;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:26 AM;What makes a FF game a real FF game?;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:26 AM;"I can FLY an airship, freely ride a chocobo, have an open map, buy stuff at shops, ect";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:26 AM;Thats more FF than 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:26 AM;you can ride a chocobo in XIII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;there are shops in XIII;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;Item shops not a floating robot ball;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;you don't fly an airship in XV;;

Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;You wouldn't fly a car.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;Lmao;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;Omg really?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:27 AM;somehow in XV you do;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:28 AM;So in 8 you flied a school;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:28 AM;via the Regalia Type F upgrade;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:28 AM;In 13 you fly nothing;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:28 AM;Just cutscenes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:28 AM;you mentioned airship though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:28 AM;a flying car and an airship are different;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:29 AM;"and if we were to really get technical, you usually fly these things as a part of the game's story in past games";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:29 AM;I think Dino even mentioned this;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:29 AM;@Marcello#4574 btw were not trying to bash the other game (i hope) just trying to find out wich is farther from the franchise;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:30 AM;So like i said in 8 you fly a school;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:30 AM;In 15 you fly a car;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:30 AM;In most games you can FLY control something;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:31 AM;I didn't know VIII was representative of all of the games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:31 AM;🤔;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:31 AM;13 you cant fly ANYTHING;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:31 AM;Only cutscene flights;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:32 AM;Even in 10 you can even choose were to fly to from a list;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:32 AM;I can ride a chocobo ANYWERE i want in 15;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:33 AM;I can talk to NPCs in 15;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:33 AM;"So you have: airship(flying), and open world as your points";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:33 AM;The talking to NPCs is HUGE;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:33 AM;"while we mentioned, combat, map creativity and design, characters, story";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:33 AM;Thats a huge point in few words lol;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:34 AM;"I played XV for a few minutes and it doesn't seem like a FF game at all, to be honest";;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:34 AM;It looks a lot like XIII-LR though;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:34 AM;We cant count 13-2 & 3;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:34 AM;even LR was closer and LR is much more like XV than other FFs lol;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:34 AM;It might feel more like FF later or in other aspects;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:34 AM;Those are sequals;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:35 AM;Im talking the original 13;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:35 AM;don't worry those don't factor becase they are different games;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:35 AM;The first thing that comes in my mind about FF is soundtrack though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:35 AM;but yeah I get what he's saying;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:35 AM;It's the only thing that remained constant in every game;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:36 AM;Soundtrack is subjective tbh imo;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:36 AM;The same reason im not including characters cuz every FF has unique characters;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:36 AM;So music and characters are out of it;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:37 AM;All of them are incredible so far. I rarely play games with impecable soundtracks;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:37 AM;we are including characters in the sense of how both games present their characters;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:37 AM;I feel its fair to keep characters and music out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:37 AM;I think it is even more fair with XIII and XV since both of them have similar issues with their cast;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;"but XIII atleast makes SOME attempt to show development, not a lot but much more than XV's efforts";;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;XIII had some weirdness at the beginning;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 im all ears on this one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;XV gave you a cast of bros that were fun to be around but you ultimately don't truly know them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;and the game itself makes no effort to get you to know them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;you pay for what little character development it does have;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:38 AM;Not true but continue;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:39 AM;XIII didn't have much either but certainly more than XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:39 AM;and it wasn't included as DLC either;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:39 AM;Im about to prove you wrong;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:39 AM;...once your done;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:39 AM;go;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:41 AM;Ok so Prompto is Noctis' best friend and far from a warrior or anyome who would have combat skills of any kind cuz hes not. He struggles in the game with trying to be a good friend to Noct cuz he feels like hes not good enough and feels more like shit when the princess dies;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:41 AM;I'm pretty sure you get that from his DLC though;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:41 AM;Nope all vanilla;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;"I know we are on #spoilers , but can we try to avoid spoilers for a while? lol";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;Vanilla ONLY facts here;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;what part in the game shows this;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;You get it from a dialog when you sleep at an inn;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;It also tells how they met;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;Sorta;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;is it a story scene?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;I agree there should be more but it is there;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:42 AM;They talk about it throughout the game speradicly;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:43 AM;There should be more but its all in there;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:43 AM;There are slight surface level things;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:43 AM;"so this inn scene, and what else";;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:43 AM;Like Gladiolus loving Cup Noodles;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:43 AM;But it's all topical;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;keep going;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;what about his past;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;Ok so when you are at the campfire scene;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;Can't help you there buddy I want more character development too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;ah;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;But there is an EFFORT at the very least;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;He bitches about it throughout the entire game about not being good enough;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:44 AM;some more of a subtle thing as I thought;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:45 AM;It's not in your face and you have to look for it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:45 AM;I thought there may have been some stuff I forgot about considering I have not played since the week of release;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:45 AM;Ya see 15 is alittle too realistic in tone that the big character development feels more like small talk;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:46 AM;"I dislike how they spread the universe into an anime, movie, and other stuff";;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:46 AM;"@Laguna Loire#9791 to be honest, it feels like you didn't finish XIII yet or didn't pay attention to the lore and logs. I'd like to ask you to read everything you can and also complete all Cie'th missions. Hopefully you will change your mind about XIII";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:46 AM;@Marcello#4574 im not against or bashing 13 tho lmao;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:46 AM;Oh god I haven't even started the XIII trilogy yet but I'm hoping to after I finish XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:46 AM;"Like I said, XIII is no crown jewel in this department either however I feel like it did a way better job at it than XV did";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:47 AM;Chill with the defensivness guys me and  @!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 are good;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:47 AM;who's being defensive?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:47 AM;lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:48 AM;Lol I'm just a really big fan;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:48 AM;No FF game I dislike... But I haven't played them all;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:48 AM;So anyway;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:48 AM;I played them all;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:48 AM;"I played XIII for more than 80h and had fun till the end, never got bored. It's so far my favorite implementation of the classic ATB system";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:48 AM;@Marcello#4574 thats cuz your a fan lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;Oh man I love X-2s ATB too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;I have about 180 hours in the first game collectively;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;Nothing wrong with that but we are tryna bring facts not feelings;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;140 in XIII-2 and 160 in LR;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;XV I have I think;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;86;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;somewhere around that range;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:49 AM;"Jeez dude, I have 42 in XV and i thought that was a lot";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;I wanted to see all that the game had to offer;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;sadly;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;the more I played it;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;"I'm not really a fan, it sure is different in some aspects from the FF series, but that doesn't make it a bad game at all";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;the more I saw that there just wasn't much of anything there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;I think I finished the story at around;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;28hr;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;I stop playing 15 before the Promto dlc came out cuz i did everything in the game and maxed out everything and every side quest;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:50 AM;I beat 13 too;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;I think there's a few select character things from places where you sleep;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;There's a lot of sleeping areas so you probably missed a few;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;No INNs in 13;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;No tents;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;The one thing I remember specifically is Ignis's cooking lessons;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;For example there's this funny one where prompto tries to sneak photos of Cindy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:51 AM;but those were moreso like little events;;
Thelitedragon#4507;18-Aug-17 12:52 AM;Yeah small events but I enjoyed them more than the side quests;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:52 AM;15 has FF tents and INNs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:52 AM;but there's a lot of off screen events;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:52 AM;or well the recycled banter you hear;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:52 AM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:53 AM;leave the ping key alone my guy;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:53 AM;y tho;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:53 AM;Im just trying to continue our convo;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:54 AM;I felt all your side of the points got lost above;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:54 AM;Some of mine too;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:55 AM;The Prompto example was too long;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:56 AM;Sorry if the name thing anoys you il try not to do it;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:56 AM;And I need some sleep. Had to teach everything about Assembly x86 real mode. In 1h. For a 40 students class. Needless to say it was a disaster;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:57 AM;Ok;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:57 AM;"oh, I thought we were still more or less on the same topic";;

Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 12:57 AM;Good night and good luck lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:57 AM;gnight;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:58 AM;I noticed your last few things got lost and i wanted you to have a fair chance to make another point;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:59 AM;Tents and INNs are in 15 lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 12:59 AM;15 has a king;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 12:59 AM;"that they are, there's nothing to go against on that front";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 01:00 AM;XIII does too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 01:00 AM;he's the main antagonist;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:00 AM;Lol ya;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:05 AM;Idr that in the original 13 but il take your word for it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:06 AM;Im burnt out from talking about this too long tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 01:08 AM;He was the Primarch which is more or less the same thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 01:08 AM;Barthandalus or otherwise known as Dysley;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:09 AM;Oh ok i remember him.... kinda;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:09 AM;In refrence;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 01:10 AM;"How can you not remember him, you probably got your ass kicked a few times in a row by him";;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 01:10 AM;"And also, sanic needs some purple";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:10 AM;Nah;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 01:10 AM;Night lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Aug-17 01:10 AM;hey no one disrespects sanic;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:11 AM;I had no trouble in 13 other than the timed autobot fights;;
Marcello#4574;18-Aug-17 01:11 AM;He is the last one. Needs more purple;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:11 AM;oOo ok;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:12 AM;I will say both 13 and 15 are easy in differant ways;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:16 AM;"Outside this entire 13/15 thing, i really wish Lightning didnt exist..... shes such a bitch lol";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:17 AM;She left Hope to die in what Zhaz called a dangerous place in the begining of the game and was so mean about it too;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:17 AM;Hope is a kid regardless if we hate him or not;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:18 AM;Anyway im going to watch something  that puts me to sleep;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:19 AM;I think we both just dont agree and thats fine with me. I dont see how 13 didnt betray FF more than 15 did. But i can say they both are far from FF so atleast we can both hope 16 is a great FF game;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Aug-17 01:19 AM;Good night;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:56 PM;Light punched Snow though.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:56 PM;And did the whole mentor thing with Hope.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:56 PM;So she's aight.;;
Aruu#2066;19-Aug-17 03:56 PM;She also admits when she's wrong... eventually;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:57 PM;Ye.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 03:57 PM;"She's also not Hope or Vanille, two worse characters in the same game.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:58 PM;Fucking Snow.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:58 PM;God.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 03:58 PM;I like Snow 😦;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 03:58 PM;I'm literally the only person in the world.;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 03:58 PM;But I enjoyed Snow's character.;;
Aruu#2066;19-Aug-17 03:58 PM;"I like Snow! He can be an idiot at times, but that's just him.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 03:59 PM;"He's maybe not the worst character, but having such a stubborn ass play deuteragonist really made me dislike him.";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 03:59 PM;Wow!  There are two of us now!;;
Aruu#2066;19-Aug-17 03:59 PM;"He wasn't handled especially well, which did him no favours";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 04:00 PM;"Light had a lot of depth to her character that was definitely present in the first game​, but wasn't addressed until later.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;19-Aug-17 04:01 PM;"Every time she started having a little more going on, they went back to the stoic routine.";;
Aruu#2066;19-Aug-17 04:01 PM;Well said ^;;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 04:01 PM;"It's been a long time since I played XIII, but from what I remember Snow like to talk about how they all should be heroes for Serah because it's the right thing to do and he went on about that a lot and it got rather old for most people.";;
Dinoken2#0946;19-Aug-17 04:02 PM;"I didn't particularly like Lightning.  I thought she was rather rude and bitchy, and even when she starts to lighten (heh) up towards the end, she's still pretty cold and distant.  But I never finished XIII-2 or even started Lightning Returns, so I never got the full arc of her character.";;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:27 PM;"Hope and Vanille are way too annoying at the beginning of the game, but as the story developed I started enjoying them both. I'd say Hope's arc was the most well developed, because he went from just a whiny boy to a real grown up. Reading the logs also gives you a better background on each character, so that helps a lot.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:28 PM;In LR she's pretty cool but lacks emotion throughout the game because Bhunivelze stole her emotions;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:28 PM;Also;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:28 PM;She smiles at the end;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:29 PM;Which is like the biggest closure you could ever have;;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:29 PM;She did try to smile in XIII though lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:29 PM;Yeah i know;;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:29 PM;When she finally forgives Snow;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:29 PM;But in LR it was extra special;;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:29 PM;Yeah;;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:30 PM;I wish the other characters had more depth in LR;;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:30 PM;Sazh's arc was really bad;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:30 PM;I think the budget wasn't big off;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:30 PM;Story content lacked;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:30 PM;The game didn't have a lot of marketing either;;
Marcello#4574;19-Aug-17 04:31 PM;I'm ok with that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Aug-17 04:32 PM;Same i liked it a lot;;

Nieran#1297;22-Aug-17 03:22 PM;SO what the fuck is the story of **Mobius**?;;
Nieran#1297;22-Aug-17 03:22 PM;Something about tkaing over the world?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:20 PM;Uh;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:20 PM;So basically you get dropped into the world of Palamecia;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:20 PM;Where you try to become the warrior of light;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:21 PM;And defeat Chaos;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:21 PM;Probably my favorite of the FF mobile games;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;22-Aug-17 04:23 PM;They call it Mobius because there are infinite micro transactions.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;22-Aug-17 04:23 PM;"JK, I'm sure it's not that bad.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:24 PM;"Oh, sometimes its bad";;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:24 PM;Like the $75 dollar jobs;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;22-Aug-17 04:24 PM;U wot.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:25 PM;But it's nowhere near the amount of micros as FGO or Granblue;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:25 PM;Yeah back in the day you could buy the Tidus job for $75;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:25 PM;But realistically itd cost more than that to roll it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:25 PM;tbh the job wasn't that good anyways... only diehard completionists went for it;;
Nieran#1297;22-Aug-17 04:26 PM;Wait so--;;
Nieran#1297;22-Aug-17 04:26 PM;Are we just random people who drop into the world?;;

Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:28 PM;Just a rando;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:28 PM;There's plenty of story and its dead easy to finish it imo;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Aug-17 04:28 PM;But most of the gameplay come from events;;

TheKawaiiCommie#4320;23-Aug-17 04:23 PM;"So, remind me again why I can't just use a Pheonix Down on Aeris after Sepiroth stabs her?";;
TheKawaiiCommie#4320;23-Aug-17 04:23 PM;"The death is good for the story, but in a game where 0 HP is death rather than KO it just is weird that she can't be revived with no explanation.";;

Marcello#4574;24-Aug-17 05:05 PM;"@Deleted User#0000 story-wise yeah, it's a bit boring, because they didn't give important and returning characters the attention they deserved, but overall I enjoyed it. It was the perfect ending to the story (since XIII-2) that should never have existed.";;
Marcello#4574;24-Aug-17 05:06 PM;"Considering how XIII-2 and LR had lower budgets comparing to XIII, they are great games.";;
Deleted User#0000;24-Aug-17 08:29 PM;Agreed!;;
Kaizer#1510;27-Aug-17 01:51 AM;"I don't get it., I've heard a mess of people hate XIII, yet I don't see that when talking with any of you.";;
Dinoken2#0946;27-Aug-17 09:09 AM;"XIII has a lot of people who hate it, but it has its fans too.  Most people respect that people can have different opinions on things and don't constantly rehash the old arguments.  I personally heavily disliked XIII, but I am willing to give the game praise where it deserves it.";;

Mirron#9949;27-Aug-17 10:31 AM;"I liked XIII a lot. I don't really get the complaints too much. It was different, but not too different for me.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;27-Aug-17 10:39 AM;XIII trilogy is a highlight of the series for me.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;27-Aug-17 10:39 AM;But it's definitely a departure from the norm.;;
Mirron#9949;27-Aug-17 02:36 PM;"I don't feel like it was too different. XV feels too different to me, XII is about as action as I can see working.";;

Mirron#9949;06-Sep-17 10:45 PM;She looks really fun in the new one. I liked her in 012 though too.;;
Dinoken2#0946;06-Sep-17 10:45 PM;I'm just excited for the full game to come out and to play all the characters.;;
Mirron#9949;06-Sep-17 10:48 PM;Same. My list just keeps growing. 😛;;
Dinoken2#0946;06-Sep-17 10:49 PM;I just hope that the 6 DLC characters aren't just the extra Duodecim characters;;
Dinoken2#0946;06-Sep-17 10:49 PM;I'd rather everyone from Duodecim be in the base game and the DLC be new content;;
Mirron#9949;06-Sep-17 10:50 PM;"I don't mind too much if they are, the only 012 character I really want is Yuna. I mostly just want them out of the way so we can focus on the new.";;

Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:47 AM;"So Sephiroth's goal, as I understood it, was to summon meteor to hit the planet. So when the planet used the Lifestream to heal itself, Sephiroth would be there to asborb all of that power, becoming a God. Did that change?";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:49 AM;"I cannot remember his goal in the original game, but I believe the Ultimania says that he wanted to absorb the Lifestream into his being to become a god.  AC changed his motivation to wanting to become like Jenova and infecting other planets with his being.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:50 AM;"Oh, interesting! Something like Starlord's dad.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:51 AM;"Right, like if Starlord actually went along with his dad's plan but also overpowered his dad's will and possessed his body";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:51 AM;That's a really great explanation! Thank you;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:53 AM;"You're welcome!  I don't know if Crisis Core changed it again, or if some other source came out and also retconned it, but I believe that's what Sephiroth's goals were at the end of AC currently.  I'm sure the remake will change everything once again.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:53 AM;VII has a lot of retcons.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:54 AM;"It certainly does. -cough- Rufus dying -cough cough-. Oh and Tseng too,  come to think of it. Though, in all fairness, they were in situations that they could have plausibly gotten out of.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:55 AM;Also everything about Genesis and Angeal.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:55 AM;UGH. Genesis.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:55 AM;"Your favorite character, I know.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:55 AM;He really made the VII story something special.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:55 AM;It was so.. loveless before.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:56 AM;Groan.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:56 AM;"If he shows up in the remake, I'm going to go and find Gackt and hit him.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:56 AM;You know he's gonna be in the remake.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:56 AM;"Hopefully just as an easter egg, but he's gonna be there somewhere.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:57 AM;"He'll be that one boss you can never beat, like Beatrix";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:58 AM;And he'll be the one who swoops in and finally kills Sephiroth after Cloud just wasn't able to do it.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 11:58 AM;Rage! It'll be like the final boss in Fable 2.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 11:59 AM;Oh you mean press Y?  Or don't and let Reaver do it for you?;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:00 PM;"Exactly. Let Lucian speak, and that floppy haired git does it for you.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:00 PM;That will be Gackt;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:02 PM;"I can see it now.  Cloud and Sephiroth will be having their stare down as Omnislash charges, and then last minute Genesis will pop in and save the day.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:02 PM;He is the face of the VII franchise after all.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:03 PM;My rage would know no bounds.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:04 PM;"Oh man, I would be pretty annoyed at first but then I would sit back and laugh long and hard for days about it.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:05 PM;It would be the greatest troll of our generation.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:05 PM;"Admittedly, it would be! Though I say that very begrudingly.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:06 PM;Sometimes you just gotta know when you got got and laugh about it.  But I'd probably hope they'd release a real ending as free DLC or something and that it was actually just a quick prank.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:08 PM;"I do wonder if Genesis will really be in the game, asides from an easter egg. I know that Squenix loved him, but he was more hit and miss with some of the international fans.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:09 PM;"I feel like he has to be.  Like it or not he's a big part of the lore now, and him not showing up would need an explanation.  Plus Square only cares about Japan.  Lightning was also hit or miss internationally I feel, but she was the poster child of FF till XV came out.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:10 PM;It'll be interesting to see how they incorperate the lore of AC and CC into the main game. I have to admit that much.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:14 PM;"And DoC and the other spin offs that weren't important.  A lot has been added to the world of VII since it came out 20 years ago.  Some of it seems obvious, like I'm sure we'll see Genesis at some point.  We might get an Angeal easter egg, maybe someone will mention Deepground from Dirge or Geostigma from AC";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:15 PM;Geostigma will be an interesting one. I wonder if we'll get anything for post game?;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:16 PM;Oh I hope there's like an Episode: Advent Children where we can play through the events of the movie.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:16 PM;That would be so cool.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:16 PM;Oh that would be amazing!;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:18 PM;"A condensed Dirge of Cerberus would be neat too, maybe just an Omega and/or Weiss superboss.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:19 PM;"I wouldn't be opposed to that! If it was well done, that is.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:19 PM;"That's the real point though, isn't it?  I'd be fine with anything if it was done well.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:20 PM;"But Square's writing recently has me a little nervous.  I'm hopeful, but still a little anxious.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:21 PM;"This is the big one, though. We can only hope that they're putting their all into it.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:23 PM;"I feel like they should be, they owe it to the game and it's legacy to make the remake as well as they can, but the episodic format along with a lot of their other choices recently have me concerned that they might just be hoping to ride the hype train out and not put too much effort into it.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:25 PM;"The fact we still know so little about it is also concerning. I know it will take time, and there's so much to be done, but even something would be better than nothing.";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:27 PM;"Yeah, they seem to be deliberately trying to avoid giving us details which is worrying.  We don't even know how far along it is in development.  Square doesn't have the best track record with releasing anticipated games in a timely fashion *cough* KH3/XV *cough*";;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:28 PM;"XV was plain terrible. KH3 seems a little better, since they admitted to announcing it a little too early.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:30 PM;"they also confirmed XVI won't be coming this gen, so since all other anticipated projects don't have a window";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:30 PM;there's like nothing to be excited about;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:31 PM;"Yeah, didn't they say recently that they haven't even started work on XVI yet?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:31 PM;idk if they have started work but apparently;;
Aruu#2066;07-Sep-17 12:31 PM;"You've said it pretty well, there really is nothing to look foward to at the moment";;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:31 PM;"And plus that fact that even though it was only announced a few years back, KH3 has been anticipated since the end of KH2";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:31 PM;they claim that the PC version of FFXV will only be half of what they want to achieve with FF visually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:31 PM;so they are deliberately putting the next game off until next gen;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;...But why?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;idk;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;XV looks fine.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;XIII looks fine.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;there's so many games that look way better;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;Why put off your next major blockbuster for something so minor?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;that have been on current gen;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:32 PM;That too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:33 PM;it is just an excuse;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:33 PM;they just want have a reason to take forever as usual;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:36 PM;It's just really disappointing.  I want XVI to come out because I want a new FF.  Not one that's been teased for 10 years.  I want to explore a new world with characters I've never heard of and play a game that didn't suffer from 10 years of mismanagement.  I don't care about the graphics enough to justify postponing it till PS5 and XBox Random Number.  I don't think anyone really does.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:38 PM;Considering the bland artistic choice they went for with XV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:38 PM;I don't really get why they feel the need to have the best tech on the market;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:39 PM;A game can be visually amazing without having super realistic graphics.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:39 PM;how about going back to making the games look like FF from a visual standpoint? but I guess this is just another step in SE turning FF into nothing but a cashgrab AAA game;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:39 PM;Look at P5;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:40 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:40 PM;P5's engine ran at 30fps (for whatever reason) but the artistic creativity was off the charts;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:40 PM;even WoFF was like that;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:41 PM;I liked the standard character designs in WoFF (not the chibi ones);;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:41 PM;I wouldn't mind if XVI had character models like that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:41 PM;"just because you use all of the latest techniques, shaders, and all of that other shit doesn't mean the game is going to look good";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:41 PM;the jiants in WoFF were pretty well designed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:41 PM;and the worlds were too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:42 PM;of course they were based on areas from previous FFs but still;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:42 PM;you can clearly see the level of creativity the franchise has had over the years;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:42 PM;and then with XV it is just;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:42 PM;grass;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:42 PM;and they want to do more of that;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:44 PM;There's only one real solution here.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Sep-17 12:44 PM;We need to assassinate the head of SE and replace him with one of us.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:53 PM;probably;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:53 PM;but I don't want the entire game to be based on that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Sep-17 12:54 PM;like I expect creativity like how Altissia was designed;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 07:28 PM;???;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 07:29 PM;"OH I must have misunderstood, sorry.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 07:29 PM;yeah I was talking about XIII's ending;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 07:30 PM;and how XIII-2 used time travel plot to justify the game's existence;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 07:30 PM;Yeah there were so many conversation points that I got confused.;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 07:30 PM;You're totally right then.;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 07:30 PM;"XIII's story was wrapped up in a neat little bow, the only thing left unfinished was what happened with Vanille and Fang.";;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 07:31 PM;But even that was conclusive enough that if they didn't want to revisit it then they didn't have to.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 07:34 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 07:34 PM;it was implied;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 07:35 PM;nothing needed to be said on the matter unless they just wanted to explain it for the fun of it;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:06 PM;Though Cocoon being left alone would probably have been a better idea than crystallizing it.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:06 PM;well according to XIII-2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:06 PM;it was fucked either way;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:06 PM;Because the events of Cocoon falling would have happened regardless of the rest of XIII-2;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:06 PM;YEah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:06 PM;gg Caius;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;I still think he is one of the best villians in the franchise though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;best part of the game's story too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;even in LR;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;he's like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;"yeah I fucked up the universe, so what?";;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;Caius was the best the XIII had to offer.;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;I mean Caius is right there with Kefka and Ultimecia as villains that more or less succeeded in destroying the world;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:07 PM;And I think that's wonderful;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-17 08:08 PM;"I still don't get what happened in some parts, but Coccon being left alone wouldn't be as bad imo";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:08 PM;and Ardyn;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:08 PM;"Yeah, and Ardyn";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:08 PM;since he succeeded too;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:08 PM;I haven't played XV so that sticks out less to me.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;Ardyn was cool;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;very obvious character for betrayal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;but still cool;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;Know which boss could have been much better?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;only wish I knew more about him;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;Bhuni;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:09 PM;as a boss fight;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;or;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;?;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;I mean we're probably gonna get;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;Bhuni as a character;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;Episode Ardyn;;
Marcello#4574;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;As a character;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;so we'll know more about him soon enough;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;ah;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;I saw a lot of XV but it doesn't really seem interesting to me;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;"thing about XV is that, the game had a lot of wasted potential";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:10 PM;dev period really made the game hollow;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;"Its had too much hype, its what happens with most games nowadays.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;they were fishing for what they should do with the plots;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;the characters;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;It's also slowly fading out of the whole Fantasy aspect.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;etc...;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;that's why we're getting dlc for each character;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;this was all leaked months before the game released;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;DLC.;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;I feel like it was somehow still unfinished by the time of release for some reason?;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;Can't we just have the full game like normal people;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;But I mean I hven't played it so 🤷;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:11 PM;EVERYONE thought the leaks were bullshit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:12 PM;but damn near everything was true;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:12 PM;"Its like how everyone is on about Sonic Forces, that won't come to much.";;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:12 PM;Forces is a little bit different.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;"Its just genuinely lack of creativity, re-used content and locations instead of something original.";;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;"A lot of the stuff about Forces has to do with Sonic Mania. People think that Mania was so good, that Forces has to be bad.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;Forces is basically Generations 2;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;It is;;
Treble#5035;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;Tho this should be in #off-topic now xD;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;they even used Mania to justify it;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;Mania is amazing tbh.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;It should have been left as its own game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:13 PM;yeah let's switch;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;10-Sep-17 08:14 PM;treble brought up a very good point too;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:15 PM;"Its not because of Mania that Forces is deemed bad, its because people know what to expect from Sonic Team with their past trash. They are too lazy and are unable to come up with something original so they re-use content from older games and give it some sand and a change of hue on the textures and class it as something new.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:16 PM;Using things over once or twice is fine but after around 4 times it gets old.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;10-Sep-17 08:17 PM;"At least you can feel to care and time they put into Square Enix games, even if they aren't always good";;

Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:08 AM;"XV was way too hyped and pushed, yeah. Way back when it was Versus people treated it like it was going to save the series, that attitude didn't change.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:14 AM;I've never been one that was into the online series of the game.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:15 AM;Imo XII is the bad apple of Final Fantasy;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:16 AM;I just could never get into it and I tried forcing myself to play it through but I never even got half way done.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:16 AM;"I like XI and XIV. Really as far as numerical games go it's only XV I can't click with. I'm looking forward to XII when I get the new version, should fix my main issue.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:17 AM;"Eh, compared to the quality and audio of X, XII is terrible.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:18 AM;I haven't beaten XII but I like it lots;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:18 AM;From what I've played of it.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:18 AM;A key criticism I've seen for it is that it's too political tho;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:19 AM;"FFXII is very much like FFT in terms of story. I don't really see that as a bad or good thing, just different.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:20 AM;"Which is probably intentional, being real, seeing as how they're both set in different eras and locations within Ivalice.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:20 AM;And was made my similar teams.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:20 AM;You see XIII saved the series.. but then XV took it back down again.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:21 AM;It was far to modern like real life aside from the monsters.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:21 AM;To be honest I think that 13 was a similar problem though.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:21 AM;"XV was the result of several ideas stitched together in less than three years, so.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:21 AM;XV was too modern (an issue that it shares with FF7 and FF8) but 13 was too futuristic.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:22 AM;XIII felt very fantasy like though to me.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:22 AM;XV had cup of noodles.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:22 AM;I want more steam fantasy FF games like 6 and 9.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:22 AM;"FF7 and FF8 was modern, but it had a proper fantasy style to it, XV was just literally RL modern,.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:23 AM;Fantasy based on reality. Which didn't mesh well with me.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:23 AM;Yeah I agree.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:23 AM;"It was done better in FF8 at least, though FF7 I'm not sure did it as well but that may be personal bias.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:23 AM;"Still, Final Fantasy is Final ***Fantasy*** for a reason.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:24 AM;"I did understand the ending of Lightning Returns though, it literally became modern Earth.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:24 AM;She made an end to all fantasy.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:25 AM;"I felt VIII was alright, as modern as I'd like FF. XV felt more so.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:26 AM;I just hope that the next main series title is a retun to form.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:26 AM;We might just want to agree on the fact that nowaday people who are hired for different companies tend to be a little lacking on creativity and more so hell bent on being lazy and constantly spouting puns so you can see why games are getting crap now.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:26 AM;Sort of like a FF9 of the new era.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:27 AM;The next big Final Fantasy release I would assume now is the FF7 remake.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;"I mean, yeah.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;"It probably depends on what you count as big, but yeah.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;It's Final Fantasy VII.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;"Though the fighting style is becoming more and more like Kingdom Hearts, they are forgetting what sort of game Final Fantasy is.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;"I expect we'll get something next year to fill the gap though, I don't think we've gone a year without a game for a while.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;Thing is.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:28 AM;Not only is the gameplay different.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;Stop treating FF7R as the same game;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;It's not;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;But the story will have some minor tweaks and expand on stuff without the need of a Compilation of FFVII again.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;Yeah;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;It's not just a remake.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;"It's a trilogy, for one thing, to give them room to do what they need to.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;It's a reinterpretation of a classic.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;The only problem I have with the remake is that its going to be episodic.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;"Trilogy, not episodic. Don't think of it as a Telltale Game series.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;^;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:29 AM;It's going to be three full length games. Not one game broken up into three parts.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;"According to Nomura, you will be able to go through almost all of Midgar.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;And it will likely be better for it because it's doubtful we'll have an entire disc just dedicated to kicking Sephiroth's ass.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;It will expand on character relationships.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;Add new scenes.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;They could easily have three separate discs to form a whole game but they split it because they care more about money than fans nowadays.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;I'm hopeful for XVI. If it doesn't turn out well though I just may focus on the spin offs.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;"Hell, if it's going to be that different, it might even create a whole new timeline.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:30 AM;That's not what's going to happen with 7 though;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;They aren't doing this to get money from the fans;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;Why is everyone so cynical about 7Remake?;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;They're doing it to give the fans the best finished product that they can because they realize that FF7 wouldn't stand up to modern standards.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;People have been asking for it since the Tech Demo was presented in 2006.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;And now everyone is like it will suck?;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;The only PS1 era FF that would is 9.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;Because of Square's recent habits;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-17 09:31 AM;Leaves people to believe so;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:32 AM;"7 and 8 don't have the character development that people expect, the leads are - let's be honest - underwhelming, the story is only passing, etc.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-17 09:32 AM;Im not impressed until we actually see something;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:32 AM;"But with 7R we actually have the opportunity to get to see Deneh, Colbalt XIV, etc.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;11-Sep-17 09:32 AM;They've just been telling us about it and not showing shit;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:32 AM;Which will make it easier to relate with Red XIII;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;That said I'm not really throwing any impressions behind it until we see more about it.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;"They have been showing, just showing the same part over and over in different angles.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;"Which honestly probably won't be until next year if they want to release in 2019, since Kingdom Hearts 3 releases next year.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;Besides.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;Nomura confirmed Cross-Dressing Cloud.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;CROSS-DRESSING CLOUD. A JOKE ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;IN FUCKING 2017.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;"I WILL say I like the little bits we've seen, namely in that the battle system is a refined version of XV's where you can switch party leads.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:33 AM;GOD BLESS.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;OH AND ALSO;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;"Don't forget, guys";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;Dissidia NT is actually the next big release title.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;The full release.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;I forgot about Dissidia;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;"Oh right, January 2018, right?";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;I hope I can play as Aerith a bit in it.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;Mhm;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;Dissidia will be great.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:34 AM;If they do what they want to do you should be able to play as Aerith.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;They went into making NT saying that they wanted to include ALL of the characters from Duodecim in it's roster.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;I call dibs killing her with Sephiroth.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;And then some.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;We've seen a bit of the 'then some.';;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;I also heard it will have a story mode.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;"Oh boy, Daddy Issues in HD! (Tidus v Jecht)";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;It had better.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;Dissidia 012 had a story too.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;I know.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:35 AM;They did well in Duodecim balancing Tidus and Jecht with Yuna;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;But since NT was an arcade game.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;so I imagine they'll do that again;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;It will not have a story mode. It will have a story though.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;I think that's what Lepusheart meant.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;They've been kind of explicit on that. Ah.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;Just making sure.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;"Since that's effectively what Duodecim had was a main game, and then versus.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;I remember back when Dissidia first came out how it bought on a  huge fan war between Kefka and Sephiroth.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:36 AM;I hope Aerith gets in.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;"Like I said, they want all of the characters from Duodecim to be here... but Aerith has significantly less of a chance.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;Because she was just an assist.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;Well I meant in general.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;They're adding characters too after all.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;"End of the day I vote Kefka the best villain because he acted on his own, not guided my his alien mother.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;Yeah true.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;"What I am worried about, is that Squeenix has shown very little about Dissidia NT's story";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;I'm not sure HOW MANY characters will be added though to be fair.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:37 AM;I vote Kuja the best villain because he never lost to the main team.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;^;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;They want at least 50.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;"Plus, dat codpiecec.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;"50 at base, and will likely have DLC.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;Means at least 16 new to go.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;No. Not at base.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;"I mean, Kuja did not disintegrate into triangles so I guess he survived.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;I mean;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:38 AM;we're in the spoilers channel so;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;At base we aren't sure what it will have yet.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;didn't they reveal in ultimania that Kuja died?;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;He still died.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;"You know when a main Villain dies, their pixels fall apart.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;He does die;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;"We have 25 revealed characters so far, and they started saying 50 at base.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;He just becomes good too late.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;I just said he didn't lose to the main characters.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:39 AM;"He calls Zidane to the Lifa Tree, Zidane attempted to save him";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:40 AM;His thongs didn't save him though. Smh;;
Aruu#2066;11-Sep-17 09:40 AM;"Hey, Kuja needs a thong, where do you think he keeps his tail?";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:40 AM;"For NT, what the developers have said is they want 50 characters at least over the ten year span of the game. I think that's meant to be taken as the minimum in the end.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;Tails*;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;I'd think it would have to if their goal is to run it through 2025;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;"For the starting roster coming out in January, we don't know how big it is.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;They have half that revealed already and there are characters that aren't in NT yet that are shoo-ins.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;Like Golbez and Cloud of Darkness.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;Golbez and CoD are coming out later this year.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:41 AM;Men like CoD because of titties.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:42 AM;"I'm gay, I just like how she fights myself.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:42 AM;Probably alone in that. So sad.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:42 AM;She does fight well though.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:42 AM;"Golbez and CoD bring it to 27. Expect a 12 villain, probably Gabranth. a 13 one, I'd not be surprised if it was Caius. Noctis (and Ardyn?)";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:42 AM;Her and Kefka made greatf riends.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;It probably will not be Caius.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;Did ya'll see Ultimecia's trailer? She looks fun.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;It will be Caius or Cid Raines.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;And she looks super fun.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;She has a trailer now?;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;Yea;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;It'll probably be Raines sadly.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;I want Barthandelus.;;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;I want time compression everywhere;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ShlDnSLfOY;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:43 AM;And the starting roster is probably in the 30 range.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:44 AM;"I can see like, 35. They need a solid, rounded number.";;
Lori The Fox#6949;11-Sep-17 09:44 AM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHEj3XZqEmE;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:44 AM;I want it to be a larger amount. I'm not going in with that expectation though.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:44 AM;"We're at 27 including Golbez and CoD, 29 when you add the 12 and 13 villains, and then 31 when you add 15 representation.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:45 AM;That would leave four spots. I could see that.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:45 AM;30 is fine for me. Noctis is likely on the base roster. But I don't see additional new additions happening before launch.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:46 AM;"If they are, I expect they'll prioritize veterans.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:46 AM;I just don't see them adding Noctis without Ardyn or another chaotic 15 character.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:46 AM;Why?;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:46 AM;Because of the massive popularity of Final Fantasy 15 as a title.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:47 AM;Eh. I can see it happening. And it makes XIV stand out.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:47 AM;"To be fair, they did add Lightning on her own, but the PSP is a different monster than the PS4 and the 13 series wasn't as popular as they wanted it to be.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:47 AM;"Well, I'd parallel Shantotto and Y'shtola. Even if they aren't from the same games they're the mascots for the MMORPG's.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:51 AM;"Yeah, but they still are lacking Chaos reps. It's weird to have every FF have a Chaos rep except them.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 09:51 AM;It's not like XI was treated badly in terms of 012 after all.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:52 AM;"True, they did add Prishe. I dunno, it could really go either way.";;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 09:52 AM;"I'm interested about how they'll add characters to the game's story though. Could they be there all along like SFV, or will the story also have updates?";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 10:00 AM;I'm hoping updates. But it could be self contained too.;;
Treble#5035;11-Sep-17 10:01 AM;"I'd be fine with updates,  just hope they aren't left as non factors.";;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 10:06 AM;I could see it. Opera Omnia exists I think to really be the story.;;
Mirron#9949;11-Sep-17 10:06 AM;And a glorified advertisement for the game.;;

Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 12:38 AM;You know what i want to learn?;;
Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 12:38 AM;"how to survive explosions, like, big ones";;
Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 12:39 AM;"maybe Rufus Shinra (in AC) can tell me, the man that survived a explosion in a tower and barely has scars or burnts :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
Valvadrix#4224;13-Sep-17 03:39 AM;The official explanation provided in the On the Way to a Smile novels is that President Shinra had an emergency escape hatch underneath his desk and that's how Rufus managed to escape mostly unscathed.;;
Valvadrix#4224;13-Sep-17 03:41 AM;"You'd figure President Shinra would think to use it before Jenovaroth killed him, but I guess he didn't manage to.";;
Mirron#9949;13-Sep-17 08:39 AM;Probably had no idea it was there.;;
Aruu#2066;13-Sep-17 09:46 AM;Yeah but President ShinRa was somewhat rotund. Could he have fit down there?;;
Sr. Barista#0413;13-Sep-17 10:18 AM;"I doubt it tbh and if hr would, he couldnt match Jenova Sephiroth's speed";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Sep-17 10:24 AM;"I imagine that scene played out with Jenova/Sephiroth walking into the room, and Shinra giving some speech about Mako and how they're going to the promised land and Sephiroth is too late and blah blah blah and then Jenova/Sephiroth just stabs him with them cringy one liner.";;
Aruu#2066;13-Sep-17 10:37 AM;Knife to see you;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Sep-17 10:41 AM;Looks like Shinra is going to have to cut some of its staff.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Sep-17 10:43 AM;"You seem to be having trouble reaching the Promised Land, why don't I take a stab at it?";;
Aruu#2066;13-Sep-17 10:51 AM;"Shinra doesn't look like the kind of guy who can/would fight. He was probably pushing the alarm button under his desk, but obviously no-one was left alive to come and answer it";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Sep-17 10:58 AM;"I can see that.  Shinra presses the button and stalls, Shinra guards will be here soon to take care of you, Sephiroth!, , And Sephiroth answers with something like There's a reason they call this the graveyard shift.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-17 04:19 PM;and almost got killed himself in the process;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;13-Sep-17 04:20 PM;I figured they wouldn't slay Snow and completely turn Hope's character upside down.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;13-Sep-17 04:21 PM;But there was still a bit of potential for something like that.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 04:22 PM;Yeah what it comes down to is that Hope thought he had to avenge his mother.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 04:22 PM;"I think that ultimately even Hope knew that Snow wasn't at fault, it was how he was coping.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;13-Sep-17 04:23 PM;"It would've changed his character significantly, but it wouldn't have been out of character exactly.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;13-Sep-17 04:23 PM;Like it was feasible.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 04:24 PM;"Depression makes you do crazy things, plus he was a hormonal teenager.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;13-Sep-17 04:24 PM;And he had that whole arc with Light where he doubles down on his resolve and stuff.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;13-Sep-17 04:25 PM;So on my initial play through it seemed possible.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 04:25 PM;Yeah.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 04:25 PM;Exactly.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 04:26 PM;At the same time they had their focuses which meant that they were going to die anyway so I didn't see any of the cast actually being killed off before their focuses were completed.;;
monokomonoe#8934;13-Sep-17 08:26 PM;"It would be huge but I think showing how Lightning and Hope learn to like Snow shows character development without being gruesome and depressing, qualities that the game wasn't really geared towards imo. Whenever something depressing happened there was usually a We can do this! moment not that far ahead, but killing Snow would be something a little harder to recover from lol";;
Mirron#9949;13-Sep-17 09:08 PM;"It would have been really hard to recover from. I didn't think Snow would die, would have been a first for an FF game really where a major playable character killed another, but it was interesting. I think XIII in general was really good with its characters.";;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 09:26 PM;I think that would be interesting but I don't think it would happen when both are party members.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 09:26 PM;Instead I think that it would be the classic heel turn villain who kills a party member and then either joins later or replaces the party member.;;
Treble#5035;13-Sep-17 09:26 PM;I think the party member would be replaced quicker than it would take for the character to heel turn.;;
Mirron#9949;14-Sep-17 08:39 AM;"That would be interesting too. Closest we've had to that I can think of is Beatrix, and it's not like she killed the party or joined it permanently, though still was a villain.";;

Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 09:18 AM;"So basically, he wanted to impersonate Zack";;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 09:19 AM;...or not?;;
Mirron#9949;14-Sep-17 09:21 AM;"From what I recall, Cloud wasn't wanting to impersonate Zack so much as he was kind of suffering from a loss of identity and he latched on to all those concepts to create one.";;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 09:24 AM;Couldn't that be Mako's fault too?;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 09:24 AM;"I remember it can make anyone insane, if you are weak enough";;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 09:24 AM;Like Cloud said and experienced;;
Mirron#9949;14-Sep-17 09:25 AM;"Yeah, that's what caused it.";;
Mirron#9949;14-Sep-17 09:26 AM;It was Mako poisoning.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:03 AM;"Cloud had a mental breakdown and was unfortunate enough to be overcoming Mako poisoning at the time. That's why he adopted Zack's personality, especially since he looked up to him";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:06 AM;ironically he didn't really adopt Zack's personality;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:06 AM;only his idealized image of it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:06 AM;"he imitated what was, in his mind, the perfect SOLDIER";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:06 AM;"because, to him, Zack *was* the perfect SOLDIER";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:07 AM;"but at the same time he didn't really know how to act, which is why he sometimes tried to act cool and aloof (like at the beginning of the game during the first reactor mission)";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:08 AM;because in his mind that was the way a good SOLDIER acted;;
Valvadrix#4224;14-Sep-17 10:15 AM;"Cloud both is and isn't a Hojo creation. He grew up as a normal person and then Hojo basically kidnapped and experimented on him, which resulted in his SOLDIER-like strength.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:19 AM;"The term Sephiroth clone was poorly localized.  Cloud is not a literal clone of Sephiroth, he's just someone that had similar experiments done to him and had Sephiroth's cells injected into him.";;
Valvadrix#4224;14-Sep-17 10:21 AM;"I never took it as poorly translated, but rather as just Sephiroth lying to Cloud.";;
Valvadrix#4224;14-Sep-17 10:22 AM;"So if it really is poorly translated, then I didn't know it was.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:25 AM;"It's poorly translated.  The clones were just experimented on in the same manor as Sephiroth, so in a sense the experiment was cloned.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:25 AM;"It's a term in universe, not just one Sephiroth says to Cloud.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:25 AM;http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Sephiroth_Clone.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:26 AM;"It's basically ShinRa's attempt to make someone like Sephiroth, not another Sephiroth as he is";;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:27 AM;I never noticed a Sephiroth clone line so far;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:28 AM;But Hojo said he wanted to create other Sephiroths;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:28 AM;And Cloud was a failed experiment;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:28 AM;"As in 'super soldiers' like Sephiroth, rather than exact replicas of Sephiroth, if that makes sense";;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:28 AM;"Cloud is a failure, yeah.";;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:29 AM;"In the eyes of making him a super soldier with the strength/power/ability of Sephiroth, they seemingly failed";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:29 AM;The clone line is in there somewhere.  I remember being incredibly confused as a child as to what Cloud's real backstory was.;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:29 AM;It's not here probably because of the modded translation :yeah:;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:30 AM;That would probably do it.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:30 AM;Oh you. It is definitely there in the original;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:30 AM;Or I didn't get to that point yet;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:30 AM;I'd be curious as to what the better translation would be;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:30 AM;Since it's an awkward term;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 10:31 AM;I think clone is the closest thing tbh;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:31 AM;Oddly enough I think Sephiroth Copy works better than Sephiroth Clone.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:31 AM;Still not perfect.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:31 AM;And can still cause confusion.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 10:31 AM;Copy makes it sound even more like it's supposed to look and be exactly like him;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:32 AM;I played Metal Gear Solid enough to not have a problem with the clone word :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:32 AM;"Maybe it just sounds weird, but clone might have other meanings besides a perfect copy";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:32 AM;The experiment was copied.  Clone as explained by a scientist like Hojo has a very specific meaning and can be really confusing.  Copy is still a pretty poor choice but it's a little bit better.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:32 AM;Sephiroth-like maybe?;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 10:33 AM;Sephiroth-esque;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:33 AM;Experimental Sephiroth?;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:34 AM;Members of the Sephiroth experiment?;;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 10:34 AM;Maybe 'clone' would be enough if Hojo explained it better;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 10:36 AM;Yeah really it just needed a clear explanation in game.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:59 AM;@Marcello#4574 That's definitely one of the few things that would have been corrected in a retranslation;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-17 10:59 AM;so you haven't seen it because it was corrected;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:01 AM;"Sooo, I finished FFX yesterday. While the story doesn't make sense at times, or feels rushed at the end, I quite enjoyed the gameplay, and if you fill some gaps, the story is quite emotional (If you can get past the daddy issues, and the religious gult complex). I felt so bad for Yuna at the end.";;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 11:03 AM;"That's good. I'm sure the new translation made me understand the game a lot better. I was afraid it could affect my experience, but so far it didn't. I just missed the memes, but that's all.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:04 AM;"Well, I mean, FFX's story is subjective to anyone.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:04 AM;"I loved FFX because of Tidus alone, his issues and how he acted.";;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:04 AM;The ending of FFX made me cry.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:04 AM;Same.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:04 AM;...STILL makes me cry.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:05 AM;FFX is heartbreaking.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:05 AM;"I got a little choked up at the end, but i didn't cry";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:06 AM;IX and X are the only endings that made me tear up.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:06 AM;"I was off from the moment Auron started to go, and it only got worse from there.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:06 AM;When they're on the airship at the end and Yuna tries to hug Tidus and fails.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:06 AM;Every time.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:06 AM;"For me was IX, VII CC and XV for some reason";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:07 AM;X was probably the first and only game to make me cry like I was living the tragedy.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:07 AM;"Other games would just make me sniff a lil bit, but with X I started sobbing while holding myself.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:07 AM;We don't have enough tragedies in today's media.  Everything has a happy ending.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:07 AM;"Oh my god the failed hug, that is just the worst.";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:07 AM;"Well not for some reason, the scene at the campfire is super great. The voice actors made it so belivable";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;I was so upset at X-2's ending for undoing the tragedy of X.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;No spolers on X-2 plz;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;Tragedy is good if it's meaningful.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;I yet to finish that;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;XV just felt forced.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;Auron shows up in a bikini dress sphere;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:08 AM;"For me, instead of when Yuna rushes to Tidus, it makes me cry everytime Tidus wraps his arms around her, despite partially phasing through her.";;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;"And there's almost focus on the effect of Noctis's actions and the post-game is just returning to the past so it's just like, why did i even finish this game, lol";;
Marcello#4574;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;"I'm out before getting spoiled, I'm done asking about VII";;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;(not like the exclusively chapter 15 content is that great anyway);;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;I was too frustrated with the ending arc of XV to really feel emotions at the ending.  I was kind of annoyed by it.  It did feel a little forced.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;"XV last scene is great regardless, I could feel how noct felt.";;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;"Yeah, right?";;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;To both.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;Lol;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;Is more like the voice actors sold it for me;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:09 AM;"VII, Sephiroth decides that the true way to be evil is to steal the world's music so Cloud and the gang have to put on one mega concert to stop him once and for all";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:10 AM;XV's ending striked me more as an epic closure than a sad one.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"WIth the music building up, Noctis pointing the ring at Ardyn.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"In fact, the scene kinds of reminds me of VII's ending.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:10 AM;With Cloud v Astral Sephiroth.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"They all died AFAIK, that's the only FF game were all protagonists die at the end AFAIK";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:10 AM;THE ARMIGER IS A GIANT REFERENCE TO ADVENT CHILDREN'S OMNISLASH NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;"The whole Ardyn story annoyed me more than anything. He basically became a villain because the Astrals were assholes and then the Astrals are like Oh, Noctis, die for us to fix our mistake, mmkay?";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;"Zidane, we don't know if the rest of the boy band died.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;Why would they die against a couple of daemons?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;They've been fighting them ALONE for over 10 years.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;They were at the end;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;AND ONE OF THEM WAS BLIND.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;When they destroy arduyn;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:11 AM;in the Afterlife or whatever;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:12 AM;It's unconfirmed because Tabata could not give enough shits to give us one cutscene with either the bros in the afterlife (where Noctis was with Luna) or in post-world of ruin;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:12 AM;It's debated about whether they died or not;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:12 AM;I like to think they did;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"But why did Noctis tell them to Stand tall, then?";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"It's the same thing his father told him, when he pulled him out of the citadel to SAVE HIM FROM THE INVASION.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:12 AM;SO HE WOULDN'T **DIE**;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:13 AM;We just have no clue what happens. Because the game focuses on the past.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:13 AM;"I agree with @BrunoBunno#1489 , FFXV feels more epic";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:13 AM;At the end;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:13 AM;"Besides, if they were to die, they wouldn't die in just a few minutes.";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;even though the story is all over the place;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;Maybe hours of long battles.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;And Noctis died almost instantly.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;"And as soon as he died, the world got purged. Only Ardyn remained.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;"To me, FFXV focuses more on the Fantasy than the Final";;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;"The rest of the bros will live, if you buy the DLC that allows it";;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:14 AM;lol;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"Finals are supposed to be sad sometimes, right?";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"Awh, it's over.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:15 AM;While Fantasy tends to be epic.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:15 AM;FFXV's weird story/lore is just a product of the fact that they had to scrap all the lore and switch directors halfway through.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"I dunno, maybe i'm over analyzing it.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:16 AM;I would be lying if I told you I didn't get the chills when Noctis destroyed Ardyn with the music rising.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:17 AM;I mean. I don't think Final Fantasy is usually referenced in-game;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:17 AM;Or given any significance;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:17 AM;With only a couple exceptions;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:18 AM;"Going back to my original point, FFX was a great game, maybe would have cried if I wasnt sleep deprived at the time";;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:18 AM;Yuna is too pure for this world;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:19 AM;And Otherworld is godtier in FF OST's;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:19 AM;This will be quick!;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:19 AM;"HIT ME WITH ALL YOU GOT, DAD!";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:20 AM;"It's really, really sad.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:20 AM;Tidus just wasn't able to sit down and talk with his dad.;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:21 AM;"That's true, never tought about it.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:21 AM;That's another tragedy. Tidus would have been fine with beating his dad up if Auron didn't tell him stuff about Jecht.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:22 AM;"But he came to being fond of him, but he still had to kill him.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:22 AM;"Sorry if I sound too much like a smartass, I just love FF's stories and plot points.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:23 AM;Nah you're good.  I also really like that by the end of X Tidus didn't hate Jecht anymore after learning more about his father but never really had the chance to reconnect with him.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:23 AM;"And in the end, he killed his father out of love instead of hate.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:24 AM;Exactly.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:24 AM;"I just love his mood swing when he agrees on fighting him, but as soon as Jecht begins to fall down, he rushes after him yelling.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:24 AM;"Just for a moment, he acted like a child who wanted his dad back.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:25 AM;FFX is just a train-wreck for people with dad problems.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:25 AM;FF is really into people with dad problems and dads with problems.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:26 AM;What happened to moms?;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:26 AM;It's so good.  I wish we would've gotten a bit more about Tidus' mom and maybe had her have some good qualities instead of the obsessed with Jecht woman we saw.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:26 AM;Zell had a mom!;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:26 AM;In VIII!;;
themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:26 AM;The mom so overlooked in FFX;;

themockingguy#6969;14-Sep-17 11:27 AM;"That was sad imo, even if the general consensus is people hating hope";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:27 AM;"Jesus, Tidus must have been destroyed.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:27 AM;Didn't he say that his mom commited suicide a couple of months later?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;"He was just a little kid by then, sheesh.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;"I don't think she commited suicide, more of a she just stopped functioning until she died.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;That too-;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;OH FUCK.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;I just realized.;;
monokomonoe#8934;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;I guess I just played VI and XV which both had a big focus on dads.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;She was so obsessed with Jecht that she couldn't handle living without him.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;The Mom Tidus saw in the Farplane wasn't HIS dream mom.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:28 AM;Tidus' mom was the real villain of X.;;

Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:29 AM;"Nah, it was.  Pyreflies react to memories.";;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:30 AM;"Jecht is abusive, fair play. But he admits it, and that it stems from wanting to make Tidus stronger, more of a man. It's Tidus' mother who lets this happen, who negelcts Tidus, who chooses her husband over her son every single time.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:30 AM;"Oh, right, right.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:31 AM;Tidus even reflects that Jecht was the one who had to remind his mother to spend time with her son.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:31 AM;"Tidus was an accident, hah.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:31 AM;Hah...;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:31 AM;You know you suck as a mother when Jecht is the voice of reason;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:31 AM;"Jecht, the abusive, drunken, washed up celebrity knows how to raise a small boy better than you.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;It still angers me in that flashback when Jecht goes missing and Tidus' mom just automatically assumes Tidus misses him.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;God she was a terrible woman.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;Makes you wonder if she did haveTidus just to keep Jecht anchored to her.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;It just goes to show she never even cared to know how he felt about him.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;"Jecht, for all his ass hattery, clearly provides for the household.";;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;A lot of Tidus' hatred towards his father also stemmed from the fact that his mother wouldn't pay any attention to him in favor of Jecht.;;
Dinoken2#0946;14-Sep-17 11:32 AM;She was just a shitty person all around.;;
Aruu#2066;14-Sep-17 11:33 AM;She really was.;;

Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:24 AM;Ye.;;

fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:25 AM;PS4 already has a large FF fanbase;;
fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:26 AM;I would buy the switch version;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:26 AM;My main reason tho is seeing what they'd do with the story as well as the idea that we'd probably see a wider variety of characters than in Dissidia.;;
fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:26 AM;"But not many people have a switch, so having it on PS4, where there is a musou and ff fanbase already would be a good business decision";;

fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:27 AM;Dissidia's story is just an excuse to team up FF protags;;

Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:43 AM;And work from there.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:44 AM;"I think ~30 makes sense based on FEW so far, reverse at least one slot for a OC";;
fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:44 AM;Oc should be WoL;;
fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:44 AM;Boom;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:45 AM;"Should be, won't bne.";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:46 AM;WoL will be the Dissidia WO;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:46 AM;L;;
fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:54 AM;Maybe 2 wols;;
fine and dandy#9438;17-Sep-17 01:54 AM;One is oc one is the dissidia one;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:54 AM;I think they're all be called Warriors of Light;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:06 AM;making a roster of 30 is impossible 🤔;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 11:23 AM;FF Musou would be neat.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 11:23 AM;"30 roster would be hard though. I'd just treat it like the original Dissidia, good and bad guy for the fifteen games.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:37 AM;I think they should include a 3rd character for EACH game;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:37 AM;Not just fan favorites like Tifa and Kain;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 11:43 AM;"I managed to make a roster that makes sense to me, with villains likely added as dlc. 30 as a number was based on FE Warriors' roster size tho";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:44 AM;"We could get , Mage of Light, Maria or Guy, (Onion ruined this concept for 3), Kain, Any of Bartz party, Any of Terras party, Tifa, Laguna, Vivi, Yuna, Prishe (100% only prishe), Fran or Balthier, Snow, Any of the scions, Arinaya (however her names spelled)";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:44 AM;Then Gilgamesh as a bonus;;

Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:46 AM;^;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:47 AM;We already know Noctis will eventually come and Ardin will be his villian;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 11:49 AM;"Here's who I'd add assuming all Duodecim characters return:, , Mage of Light, Leon, Xande, Edge, Yang, or Cid, Faris or Galuf, Celes or Edgar, Barret, Vincent, or Aerith, Seifer or Rinoa, Beatrix or Steiner, Seymour, ??? Never played XI, Vayne, Ashe, or Balthier, Caius, ??? Never played XIV, Assuming Ardyn and Noct are in, Aranea or any of the boy band.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:50 AM;But if all the 012 return then it beats the purpose of adding 3 characters for each game lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:50 AM;Equally;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:50 AM;Acording to your list;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 11:51 AM;The 012 characters are just extra in that situation.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 11:52 AM;"Or just cut out the duodecim game's character.  So it'd look more like:, , Mage of Light, Leon, Xande, Celes or Edgar, Beatrix or Steiner, Vayne, Ashe, or Balthier, Caius, ??? Never played XIV, Assuming Ardyn and Noct are in, Aranea or any of the boy band.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:53 AM;I like that list;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:54 AM;We need Vayne as a promised 12 villian;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 11:54 AM;"I would really like Vayne to be in it, but I'm also torn because I also really want Ashe and Balthier.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:54 AM;And 13s main villian too (tho i dont like 13 its only fair);;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:55 AM;Wait... we dont need Vayne;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:55 AM;We have Gabranth as a sub for 12s villian;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:55 AM;I almost forgot lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:56 AM;"So Ashe, Balthier, or Fran would work fine";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 11:56 AM;"13's main villain would not work for Dissidia.  He's a giant weird mech statue robot thing.  Caius, the villain from XIII-2 is a fan favorite and is pretty much designed for Dissidia.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:57 AM;Ok that works perfect;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 11:57 AM;"I would still prefer to have Vayne, just liked I'd rather see Seymour in there.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:57 AM;Or a sub villian in 13 aswell;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:58 AM;Example Jecht or Gabranth being sub villians;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 11:58 AM;Idr 13 too well;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 11:59 AM;"Chocolina, i dunno";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 12:00 PM;"XIII on its own had two other character that could possibly fit that, Jihl Nabaat and Cid.  Neither of which were very well liked or as good of villains as Caius.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 12:00 PM;Ah;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 12:00 PM;Caius gets my vote then;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 12:00 PM;Btw Id be sooooooooooooo pissed the F off if Prishe isnt in it. Shes one of my favorite FF characters and the main character of 11 (shantoto was a minimal side npc who rules the munchkin people);;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Sep-17 12:01 PM;I just don't want the duodecim characters to count against adding new characters from specific titles;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 12:01 PM;Shantoto has a few fans cuz she raps alot;;

Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 12:25 PM;3 each was too much tbh;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 12:57 PM;Caius is probably not getting in. And three each is easy to do and really should be done. It lets you make a team for each FF.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 12:58 PM;Also it would be easy to add Barthandelus. It won't be him but has nothing to do with not fitting.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:26 PM;"Oh, were we talking about Dissidia? I thought we were talking about a Musou game still.";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 01:29 PM;I think people mixed the two.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 01:30 PM;Roster discussion looks like Dissidia without context.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:31 PM;Fair.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:31 PM;"Dissidia would be much easier to make three for, except for probably the original Final Fantasy.";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 01:31 PM;"I suppose you could make a balanced team of WoL, Black Mage of Light, and White Mage of Light but WoL is meant to represent all four of them in some way or another.";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 01:59 PM;white mages didn't have attacks besides holy and whacking with a rod back then;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 01:59 PM;iirc at least;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:08 PM;I'd do Sarah.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:09 PM;And I think WoL is meant to represent the concept of the Warrior of Light.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:09 PM;But Sarah is super easy to do for Dissidia without much hassle.;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:10 PM;"I want Rydia, Celes, Tifa, Prishe, and Lyse., I feel like they're probably not doing Rydia or Celes, and the other XIV rep is Thancred.";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:11 PM;I want a lot of characters.;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:11 PM;I would rather have Fang than Noel but it'll probably be Noel if there's another 13 rep.;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:11 PM;Or Cid Raines maybe?;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:12 PM;It'll probably be Serah or Raines.;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:12 PM;Do they just drop the one villain per game thing when it gets to 11?;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:13 PM;We don't know what the rules are. And they likely added Prishe because Shantotto isn't really a main hero.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:22 PM;Shantotto is seen more as a villain than a hero tbh so Prishe is her heroic counterpart;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:23 PM;13 will see Raines or Caius as their second rep;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:23 PM;Shantotto and Prishe were both on Cosmos's side though;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:24 PM;My guess for XIII is that if they are fine with taking from sequels it'll be Caius;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:24 PM;Or Noel...;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"Yeah, but at the same time wasn't Shantotto in XI the star of a villain arc?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:24 PM;Caius will be the villian;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:24 PM;not sure if anyone will join him;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;We know they're fine with side games. Caius is Lightning's mirror.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;but he's the most qualified out of any of the antagonists in the game;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"Who knows if we get another hero, but if we do it'll be Serah.";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"Yeah, Orphan won't exactly fit in a fighting game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;for heroes Serah could work;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;it really depends;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;Snow might end up getting in instead though;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:25 PM;please no;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;Wasn't Hope a DLC assist or did I dream that?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"he's more likely to, though tbh I wish we could have goddess of death lightning";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;I think the sequel protagonist takes precedent over the original deuteragonist but also... Maybe;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;instead of l'cie lightning;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;adds better variety;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"Valkyrie Lightning, tho";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 She has an alternate costume that looks like either the end of XIII-2 or LR, I can't remember";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;Xiii-2;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;Her abilities remain solely XIII though from what I've seen;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;see alternative outfits aren't the same;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;LR wasn't out at the time that 012 came out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;she's still designed like her XIII self;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;Yeah unfortunately;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;I don't think that's an inherently bad thing. She still fought pretty cool as a l'cie;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:27 PM;It isn't a bad thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:28 PM;it's just her LR self would've been better;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:28 PM;especially in terms of diversity;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:28 PM;But at the same time even tho side games count for this new game when it comes to characters in multiple games the original game takes precedent;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:28 PM;The same thing happened to Yuna;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:28 PM;She kind of plays like Squall + Yshtola;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:28 PM;She got her x 2 gunner look but remained a summoner.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:29 PM;I'm glad Yuna went back to her original form and not that bullshit they turned her to in X-2 lol;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:29 PM;Personal preferences aren't my point :p;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:30 PM;"It was cool because it gave her interesting gameplay. You couldn't look at her model for much telegraphing, and I think in many cases if you blocked her attacks she wasn't staggered because she wasn't the actual one attacking";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:30 PM;I prefer Yuna how she is at the *end* of X-2 personality wise but think she's more varied as a summoner.;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:30 PM;"of course, it's been a long time and I could be remembering incorrectly";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:30 PM;Unless they chose to make her like Bartz as opposed to Laguna;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:30 PM;For comparisons sake;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 02:31 PM;Laguna was annoying to fight against;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:37 PM;Caius won't be the villain.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:38 PM;"I also definitely don't think he's most qualified, but it'll be Raines.";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:38 PM;Just look at how SE pushes one over the other.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:38 PM;And Shantotto isn't a villain. She's a hero.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:38 PM;"She just is more like, a retired hero.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;"thing is, Raines was barely a villian";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;I don't see SE pushing Raines at all. In fact after he became popular when XIII was released you didn't hear about him again until LR and then it was just oh.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;That doesn't seem to matter to SE.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;just another one controlled by the fal'cie;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Whereas Caius was advertised as Lightning's direct opposite.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Theatrhythm Raines is the villain for XIII.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Multiple times;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Record Keepers Raines is the villain.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:41 PM;neither of those are FFXIII;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:41 PM;Caius seems to be Genesis tier popularity wise for XIII.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:41 PM;"No, they aren't.";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:41 PM;But those are indicative of what SE is likely to do here.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:41 PM;Caius is playable in Record Keeper iirc;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Nope.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:42 PM;But I may be wrong;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Jihl is.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Caius still isn't.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Yeah I remembered wrong;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:43 PM;Is Noel in RK? Because they may be avoiding xiii-2 outside of Serah altogether;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:43 PM;And I find Theatrhythm especially damning. And Noel is.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:43 PM;They specifically added Raines as a Chaos rep for XIII.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:43 PM;The only reason to make Raines the XIII counterpoint is because they're not acknowledging xiii-2.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:44 PM;They didn't add a Chaos rep to every game. XI and XIV are missing one.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:44 PM;But they added Raines for XIII. And they've got Serah and Noel in it too.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:44 PM;he wouldn't be a good choice even if you disregard XIII-2;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:44 PM;I don't think Raines is a good choice. It should be Dysley.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:44 PM;But it's what SE is doing.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:45 PM;But if they're going to factor in XIII-2 in deciding what to add to Dissidia there's no reason for them to choose anyone but Caius;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:45 PM;and you can't say that's what they're going to do because you don't know that;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:45 PM;I don't know absolutely.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:45 PM;unless you have some inside knowledge we don't know about;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;I think SE views Dysley as unworthy due to playstyle. It's more interesting with a sword user to them.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;But you aren't pointing out crossover games where they add Caius.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;"Nah, Dysley isn't popular,";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;He's too old.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;just because they didn't do it before doesn't mean they can't or won't do it now;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;I mean that's part of the reason they chose Jecht over Seymour;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;What?;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:46 PM;The playstyle thing.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:47 PM;"No, they chose him because Tidus has no compelling motivation to fight Seymour alone.";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:47 PM;There isn't any drama without Yuna.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:47 PM;The other was that Yuna was in contention for being playable as early as the original Dissidia;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:47 PM;Seymour is more Yuna's rival.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:48 PM;"And I'm not saying they can't add Caius. But there is zero reason to think they will when games with an easier barrier to entry still hold him back,";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:48 PM;We've got characters that have zero shot of getting into Dissidia in Record Keepers. Still no Caius.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:49 PM;And they purposely added a villain for Theatrhythm. Why didn't they add Caius if they wanted him to be in? They aren't ignoring the trilogy.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:49 PM;"I think they wanted Caius to be popular, but he bombed. Like Lightning but worse. So they backed off on gujz";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:50 PM;Him.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:50 PM;bombed how;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:50 PM;lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:50 PM;he's regarded as one of the best villians in the franchise;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:50 PM;"again, all of your claims are based on the idea that they didn't do it before";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:51 PM;"In Japan he's less popular than Barbaricca, so there he clearly did.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:51 PM;hasn't SE already proven that their decisions can be widely different between each and everything they do;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:51 PM;And it isn't simply they didn't do it before.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-17 02:51 PM;where is information coming from;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:51 PM;It's they didn't do it before and they purposely went for another option.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:51 PM;Record Keepers.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:52 PM;They do polls to see what villains people want added.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:53 PM;"Seymour was considered to be in the original Dissidia Final Fantasy as the Chaosrepresentative of Final Fantasy X, but was rejected in favor of Jecht. Various traits of his, however, were included with Emperor Mateus in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, and the rivalry between Yuna and the Emperor in that game, and to a lesser extent, the rivalry between Tidus and the Emperor from Dissidia is similar to their rivalry with Seymour Guado";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:53 PM;This isn't what I remembered;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:53 PM;But;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:53 PM;It's what I was thinking of;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 02:53 PM;Lol;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:53 PM;"That isn't mechanics, yeah.";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:54 PM;It's about story and interactions. It's why we got Golbez instead of say Zemus too.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:54 PM;Though there was much less contention there.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 02:54 PM;"Did see someone saying we should get Zemus, which I found funny.";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:20 PM;@Marcello#4574 also the thing where she basically loses the esper half of herself;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:20 PM;and kind of went into kefka's tower thinking that she might die even if they beat kefka;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:21 PM;Oh yeah. Does she lose it even if you don't get her into your party again?;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:21 PM;"Yeah. In the end all magic and espers leave the world, or something.";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:22 PM;So rescuing her or not has no effect in the final cutscene?;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:22 PM;I mean;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:22 PM;she won't be in the cutscenes at all;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:22 PM;But the same thing happens in the story;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:22 PM;About magic leaving the world;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:23 PM;I don't know. I rescued her. Lol;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:23 PM;I see. Only that and the town part then;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:24 PM;It did add to her character but felt... weird;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:24 PM;"You would expect more screentime devoted to Wow, am I literally going to die even if we defeat Kefka? But whatever. I don't mind Celes being the new main character.";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:25 PM;Maybe making her not dispensable?;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:25 PM;Is it really possible to beat the game without Terra?;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:25 PM;Very possible;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:26 PM;"Wow, that's kind of dumb.";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:26 PM;"Hell, you could even beat the game with 3 characters";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:26 PM;Weird. Player's choice and all though. I guess it's kind of advanced in that regard.;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:27 PM;"Actually, I'm not sure now";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:27 PM;😛;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:27 PM;"I know Edgar is mandatory, but I can't remember how";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:27 PM;"Setzer is too, but that's kinda obvious";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:27 PM;"Okay, so Terra does not have to be in your party, but she does do her thing in the end cutscenes.";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:27 PM;Source: gamefaqs;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:28 PM;I'd feel like an asshole for letting Terra lose her powers even though she didn't find herself in the end;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:29 PM;It's weird that Locke isn't mandatory even though he's the reason Celes doesn't simply try to kill herself a second time;;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:29 PM;"If you don't let Cid die, she won't think about killing herself";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:30 PM;"Oh, that's true. There's a way to keep him alive.";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:30 PM;"Also, Locke's side-quest was the worst one";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:30 PM;Phoenix Cave was annoying;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:30 PM;"It's definitely the hardest, but it gives you Phoenix and Ragnarok magicites";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:31 PM;"Oh yeah, basically beating the game essentials";;
Marcello#4574;17-Sep-17 03:32 PM;You can go through Kefka's Tower by only spamming Ultima;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 03:33 PM;I'm sure.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 04:23 PM;Honestly I think that if they do a remake it should be mandatory to recruit the core characters in the world of ruin;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 04:23 PM;Even if the rest are optional;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 04:32 PM;"So everyone except Mog, Umaro, and Gogo?";;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 04:41 PM;Gau is arguable tbh. But basically.;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 04:45 PM;"gau actually has like, little story arcs";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 04:45 PM;like when you bring him to meet his dad;;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 04:46 PM;"i think it would be safe to say he is a core character, even if he can be left behind";;
monokomonoe#8934;17-Sep-17 04:46 PM;"i mean there is a whole giant area dedicated to him, and im pretty sure the tyrannosaurus island thing is meant for him too";;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 05:22 PM;I was mostly counting everyone who isn't optional.;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 05:53 PM;I'd include Mog too though;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 05:53 PM;To bring it to 12;;
Treble#5035;17-Sep-17 05:53 PM;Allows for 3 4 person teams at endgame;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 06:10 PM;I generally do too.;;
Mirron#9949;17-Sep-17 06:10 PM;Umaro and Gogo feel different than the rest.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;17-Sep-17 10:23 PM;Sup guys;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:14 AM;@Mirron#9949 @Psychotic Ninja#0661 Tidus and Yuna breaking up is a _clear_ fakeout.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;"The idea of beckoning is actually a good one, I'm just worried they'll use it to revisit all of the same plot points as X.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;"From what I recall, Yuna broke up with TIdus because he was talking with a female friend";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;or something like that;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;Which would be fine if it ultimately led somewhere else.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;She tried to claim she loved someone else.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;Which is total _bull_;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;"and is only because he, himself, is dead.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;"It might be a clear fakeout, but it's still silly.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;^;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:15 AM;It just seems like wasted drama.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;Oh yeah I'm not saying it's not.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;Bc it is;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;We went through the entirety of X-2 to literally see the two of them get back together.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;"It's also the fact that Sin is back, but that is really silly.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;Honestly I could accept -will- more without the breakup and without X-2.5;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;Which _necessitated_ the breakup.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;I put my input on this stuff in the general room;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:16 AM;"Also, with Sin now back, it confirmes my theory that, like with DBZ, death is basically pointless";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;if one can be wished back;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;or summoned back;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;really;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;"Sin's just a summon though, it makes sense it can be summoned back.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;I think Sin being back is interesting as a temporary plot device.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;^;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;The issue is there is no summoner to summon Sin.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;What Sin being back means is;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;Someone beckoned either Jecht;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;or Yu Yevon;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;YuYevon;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:17 AM;I think any justification they use to make it happen will be silly.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;Either of them would be interesting.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;"If anything, Sin will be taken down by the end of act in in X-3";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;But also.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;I think Sin will be taken down by the end of Act 2.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;Then act 3 and act 4 would focus on a bigger bad.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;Like the return of Seymour;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;I would like that kind of.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:18 AM;YuYevon has to many people praying and putting all their faith and humanity into him so he grows stronger;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;But no one is praying to Yevon anymore. And that isn't really how summons seem to work.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;Him killing people makes people pray more and worship more;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;Faith doesn't seem to be important any.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;There are Yevonites.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;Not anymore after 10;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;And I'm sure there are people that were devoted to Yevon at the end of X and X-2 that they could beckon Yu Yevon.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;Your right;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;To be honest;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;I think Kurgum did it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:19 AM;Im a X2 hater i admit;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;"Eh, I think managing to summon Yu Yevon would be silly.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;He's obsessed with Yuna and seems like the type that would go to the extremes to see her in action and get to meet her;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;You can't just summon the dead really. That isn't what a summon is.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;It's not summoning;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;It's beckoning;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;"I wont sit here bashing X2 tho so no worries ;)";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;Beckoning =/= summoning;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;"Beckoning seems to be sending, but in reverse.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;And based on X-2.5 it's all Yuna's fault.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;"So, could we also get Auron back?";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:20 AM;Does that actually happen in FFX? I don't really recall it.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;It's in -will-;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;And _theoretically_ but I doubt it.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;Ah. So basically they made something up to justify a sequel.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;Auron will reappear as closure for Chuami and to figure out if she's really his kid;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;"I wish Auron, Tidus, and Lulu was playable in X2";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;But I think that people that have been beckoned will turn into fiends.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;Tidus is my second favorite FF character;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;So...;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:21 AM;Imagine Auron as a fiend and as a boss monster.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 12:22 AM;tearjerker right there;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:22 AM;I have no hope for X3 but if Tidus is the main character again then i may play it;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:22 AM;It's actually the perfect twist.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;Honestly I think X-3 would be the same as X in that Tidus and Yuna share the lead spot.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;Nah;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;I mean.. .yah;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;I agree.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;X2 is the style of all the japanese merchandise;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;Tidus and Yuna were basically the mains of X anyways.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;So FF10 is dead;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:23 AM;FF10 had them as co-leads and with him around again I see no reason that they won't do it.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;They wont make a game like FFX for X3;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;"I think they would, though.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;Even with the turn-based battle style. MAYBE without a sphere grid.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;All the 10 stuff in japan is all ships and romance novels;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;And you have Digimon and Persona to thank for that.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;It'll probably be an action game.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;Because that's SE's new thing.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:24 AM;Read my last thing i said;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;I dead serious;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;You do know that FFX was a romance story;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;right;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;X2 did too much;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;at it's core that's what it was;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;"(VIII, IX, and X all were)";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:25 AM;But X had romance  in it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;It had alittle bit of everything for everyone nomatter what your thing is;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;Thats why its a masterpiece;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;"But the point is that it was a romance story so if you want to complain about X-2.5 and such featuring romance, blame X.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;That leads to why i dont like X2;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;X-2 had LESS romance than X did.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;Significantly so.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:26 AM;Its not about romance;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;The central focus in FFX is the romance between Tidus and Yuna.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;I just feel X had alittle something for everyone to love about it in general;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;Which leads to them wanting to defy;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;Yuna's overall fate while wanting to save the world.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;No it wasnt at all;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;"The twist is that either way one of them has to die, or stop existing.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:27 AM;It LITERALLY is though.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:28 AM;10s romance was a small part of the story;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:28 AM;No it really wasn't.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:28 AM;10's romance is the reason the game keeps going past Luca.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:28 AM;It was part of the story but not the entire story;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:28 AM;It was the core of it though.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:28 AM;Nah;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:29 AM;That's why Tidus and Yuna were co-leads.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:29 AM;I didnt see it that way at all;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:29 AM;I saw the love story in it but didnt see it as the point of the entire game;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:29 AM;"It was both of their story and it was their love story. They both had their own things going on with Jecht/Zanarkand and the pilgrimage, but the heart of it is the romance.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:29 AM;Tidus falling in love with Yuna is what makes him decide not to accept her fate like most of the other Guardians did.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;Which leads to the fight with Yunalesca.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;Which leads to them having to find another way to defeat Sin.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;Which leads to them destroying Yu Yevon.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;Its crazy to say the entire story of 10 is all about love only;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;I would agree with Treble. Tidus and Yuna's romance was a huge part of FFX.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;That's not what I'm saying.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;No one said it's about love only.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;What about Tidus and his Dad;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;I'm saying the HEART and CORE of the story is the love story.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;X-2 isn't about love only either.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;The story would've stopped if it weren't for the romance plot.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;We;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;"There was the entire thing with Paine, Spira moving forward all of that.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:30 AM;"We'd get to Yuna choosing her final aeon, getting it, killing Sin, and restarting the cycle.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;What about Tidus and his father?;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;Tidus would have been a neat final aeon I bet.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;Tidus and his father was a personal plot.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;That was about Yunas love too?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;Not the core of the plot.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;Lol ok;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:31 AM;"No, but it wouldn't have happened the way it did if not for Tidus and Yuna bonding.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:32 AM;Imagine if Yuna had never put two and two together about Tidus being Jecht's son and then all of a sudden it was Auron at Luca saying;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:32 AM;oh your dad is Sin;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:32 AM;the plot would be nonsensical.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:32 AM;I feel that we both are in a situation were we both played the same game but saw 2 differant things happen;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:33 AM;I seen all the things your talking about and its all true but nowere near the focus or main plot;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:33 AM;In my eyes*;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:33 AM;Im sorry im not trying to challange you lol;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:33 AM;Oh no it;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:33 AM;"it's no trouble, I like debates like this.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:34 AM;Im sorry if it feels that way;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:34 AM;"I mean, Suteki da Ne is a pretty big deal. And the focus for Tidus wasn't about Jecht, it was about Yuna. Jecht was definitely there, but I felt like it was more icing than the cake for Tidus.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:34 AM;I innocently genuinly feel something entirly differant in my love for yhat game;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:34 AM;Its a masterpiece in my eyes;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:34 AM;Jecht being there was about giving Tidus closure.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;It has alittle of every genre in it;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;Alittle bit of something for everyone to love about it;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;"I'm not sure I agree with that, but it is a good game.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;In a general way;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;"Jecht was a shit dad who basically disappeared into thin air and Tidus never got to say goodbye even if he hated his fucking guts and it haunted him for the next ten years, so he needed the closure. In the context of the story we needed to see Jecht wasn't a terrible guy.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;At the same time.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;Not like the niche of X2 but thats another convo;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:35 AM;It'd lose some emotional weight but if they cut the flashback portions of the game it wouldn't change the plot a whole lot.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:36 AM;X-2 has more going on than Yuna and Tidus. A lot more.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:36 AM;A niche demographic;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:36 AM;X2 is nothing like X;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:36 AM;"X-2 isn't exactly a niche demographic, and it's a good game, but you're gonna have a Bad Time™ if you try to compare it to X.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:37 AM;Now I disagree with that regardless.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:37 AM;It's like X in a lot of ways but it's also not trying to be X.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:37 AM;It tells it's own story in the same setting and despite meandering through the first two chapters it has a pretty good story on it's own.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:37 AM;But X2 is another debate that we all are tired of lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:38 AM;Anyway;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:38 AM;Whats your favorite part of 10?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:38 AM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_LREjt4HJU;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:38 AM;this'un;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:39 AM;Yunalesca was a pretty good part.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:39 AM;"Shame Yunalesca is kind of a one note character, would have made an interesting Dissidia addition if not.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:39 AM;@Mirron#9949 whats your favorite part?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;I mean Ultimecia is equally as one-note.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Not really.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Ultimecia is present from Disc 1.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Adel is more the Yunalesca equivalent.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;"Important for setting up the setting and world, but not the main bad.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Is this all cuz im Laguna? hahaha;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;";)";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;"I'd like to see Ultimecia brought back in X-3, but I mean at the same time I sort of expect to see most major antagonists from X showing up eventually";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;".Yeah, that's fair.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Ultimecia brought into X-3 would be interesting.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:40 AM;Though Yunalesca is also more present than Cloud of Darkness.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;Time compression brought her to Spira.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;Who Dissidia gave a personality to;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;I'm teasing.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;So they could do it.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;I MEANT YUNALESCA it's late sorry;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;I knew it aha!;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;Cloud of Darkness isn't really added to though from FFIII.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;You guys just miss me ^_^;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:41 AM;"She's basically an entity that exists to bring balance, I don't feel they added anything to her in Dissidia.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;"They totally could add Yunalesca to Dissidia, that isn't the issue. The issue is she'd be getting in over Seymour and Auron as major competition off the top of my head.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;I also think that Yunalesca being so one-note was the point.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;Because X did well with it's major villains.;;

Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;My family;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;"But Yunalesca was sort of a fiend in and of herself, even if she looked humanoid, as proven by her boss fight.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;So she didn't have the same emotions of a human anymore.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:42 AM;She existed to serve a purpose.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;I agree.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;Lol;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;"She wasn't bad, but it would be a bad addition for Dissidia, which is different.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;Yeah;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;And your son is cute. 😛;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;I can agree with that.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;Ayy thank you lol;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;"And it isn't even because of who she is, so much as who her competition is.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;Runs in the genes;;
Uncle Cundy#9999;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;tidus and yuna's romance is mos def the focal point of ffx;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;"Agreed, Laguna is cute too.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:43 AM;"I'd want to see Seymour next, to give Yuna a decent rival.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;I will date both.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;And Seymour would be great.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;I really feel like he has a shot.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;"^^;  brb i gotta leg cramp";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;"SE seems to be pushing him more than I would expect, mostly based on Theatrhythm.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;He has a shot as DLC at least.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;Yeah.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;I dunno if FFX will be getting any more characters in the base.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;They've already promised Yuna on top of the two already in the game.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;I hope im in Dissidia :*(;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:44 AM;You will be.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;All the 012 are returning.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;^;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;We don't know the full starting roster yet.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;I make all the cutscenes memorable;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;"Seymour as DLC is possible though, yeah.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;They'll make some cuts from the 012 cast for the base and I feel like Laguna is one of the more expendable ones.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;I swear im the most likable interaction with the other FF members;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;Along with Aerith and Tifa and a few others.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;But he'll be added eventually.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:45 AM;I fear shes right....;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;Aerith isn't part of the 012 cast really. Or at least is different.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;Im expendable so im a 50% chance of being in NT;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;I feel Feral is different too.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;"No, you'll be in. Just up to it being DLC or not.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;"I'm a guy, but, easy mistake. xD";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;^ that;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;Sorry;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;"I was saying I don't see Laguna being in over, say, Yuna.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;....;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;That was rude of me;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;"I did that on purpose, totally.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:46 AM;And no it's no trouble.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;"There are currently six missing characters from the 012 roster, not counting Feral and Aerith.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;The only new additions confirmed are Kain and Lightning.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;Right?;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;I pray im in it;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;For 012?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;OH;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;Vaan;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;We have... yeah.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:47 AM;I hope im not paired with Lightning omfg NO;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;She ruined my scenes;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;"The NT bare minimum roster will be the arcade up to now, CoD, and Golbez. Probably Noctis too.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;"We may get more than that though, we don't know.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;Me and Lightning are both leader types but we go about it in a opposite style;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;I also expect a 13 and 15 villain.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;You also shoot stuff.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;We may not actually get Golbez.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;We will.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:48 AM;We kept bumping heads in 012;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;Because of the silhouette.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;Oh true;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;I was thinking they may position Kain as Cecil's rival.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;Nah.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;Though Nomura tried to do that with the original.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;She interupted me and Squall meeting for the first time since 8;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;It's also why I don't expect additional new characters beyond Noctis.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:49 AM;I feel like they'll prioritize old characters first.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:50 AM;I hate Lightning with a passion;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:50 AM;"I think that of the 012 characters that aren't in yet for the base the ones we're most likely to see are Yuna, Tifa, and maybe Gilgamesh.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:50 AM;Every fan wanted to see me and Squall but Lightnings a bitch;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:50 AM;"I wonder if Yuna will be Heavy, Shoot, or Unique.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:51 AM;I could see any of those.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:51 AM;Sorry for my language;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:51 AM;I think Unique is most likely if they go for the summoner playstyle.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:51 AM;"Well, that's also why I said Heavy.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:51 AM;I feel they could make a Summoner that is Heavy instead of Shoot.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:51 AM;"Hmm... yeah, I could see that.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:52 AM;Im the most unique playable character in dissidia;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:52 AM;I disagree with that.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:52 AM;"Also Unique is pretty much up in the air, there isn't any rhyme or reason necessarily to who is one or not at times.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:52 AM;They had to get creative to make my battle style;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:52 AM;"Lightning's existence negates that, mainly because >gun usage.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:52 AM;"I'd argue the most unique playables are Cecil, Bartz, OK, and Yuna.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;Im more unique than Yuna by alot;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;Same with Bartz too;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;Not when it comes to the Dissidia cast tho;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;Yuna has some quirky oddities with her Summons and how they work.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;Waaay more unique in playstyle over those 4;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;I would say Emperor is pretty unique.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;"There's no one that does what Yuna does, though you could argue that Bartz is the least unique at the same time - at least before NT";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;The whole trap thing is pretty unorthodox.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:53 AM;That's true too.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;He basically changes the entire gamestyle if played well.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;Im the most obviously unique character in terms of gameplay;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;>>;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;I think you're a little biased.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;"Not really. If Laguna is the most unique (which I don't agree with), he would be the least obvious.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;Literally Bartz is similar to Gilgamesh and Firion;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;Because there are much more obviously oddball characters. I don't even really recall Laguna's gimmick.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;Bartz is a weird case.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:54 AM;Laguna's gimmick was that he was entirely long range iirc.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;"Any of the form changers, for starters, stand out a ton. As... that's basically Ultimecia's gimmick though.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;Yuna has unique animations dont make her fighting unique;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;Her fighting is unique because the summons create odd hitboxes.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;What makes her fighting unique is that she has constant use of summoned beasts;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;Which you literally don't see anyone else doing;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;It's the only case where I can think of no playstyles overlapping.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;But really Laguna... doesn't do anything all that unique from what I recall. He does have some odd grenades at least.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;But odd hitboxes dont mean unique;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:55 AM;But that's not all that special.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;No what's unique is that no one does anything close to her schtick.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;Laguna being unique is negated by the existence of Lightning and even Vaan.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;"I shoot my gun, use my sniper that bullet bounces, toss granades, use ragnarok nuke lazers";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;Okay?;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;Unique af;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;How is that more unique than the Emperor?;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;Are you just talking aesthetics? I'm talking mechanics.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:56 AM;Emperor is similar to Ultimicia;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;Not even remotely.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;"Like... wow, they are night and day.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;"If you wanna compare Ulti to someone, try Terra or Kuja.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;He sets traps;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;Terra really.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;Yeah;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;Kuja is more mobile than shooter.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;Ultimecia doesn't set traps.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;No one sets traps.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:57 AM;"Y'shtola does now, but that's it, and not as much as Emperor does.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:58 AM;The Emperor's entire gameplay style was radically different from anyone in 012.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:58 AM;"Think about it, unbiasedly, the only one whose gimmick isn't repeated somewhere right now is Yuna";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:58 AM;I admit there are some unique characters but im the most in an obvious way;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:58 AM;And it'll be that way until we see another Summoner.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:58 AM;"If you mean aesthetics Yuna is kind of unique, but there is Kain and others too that have unique jobs.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:58 AM;"Cecil, if nothing else, is the lone Dark Knight, and that's unlikely to ever change.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;I mean gimmicks more than anything else.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;Yunas hitboxes arent more unique than my unorthodox playstyle;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;You might be right about Kain tho;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;Cecil's gimmick overlaps with Onion Knight's.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;"I mean, there are tons of unique gimmicks in general.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;Oh I'm not arguing that at all;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;Yuna has asthetic uniquness;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;Cecil is very different than Onion Knight though.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 12:59 AM;I mean more like... there's no one else really doing the summoned beast thing yet.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;Your a Yuna fan lol;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;I mean that in the basest sense of they both switch jobs.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;"I mean yeah, but that's not why I'm saying that.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;You being a Laguna fan however is the reason you keep insisting he's the most unique.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;"Look at all my moves, who has anything similar to the way you play Laguna?";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;I don't really see why Yuna's is all that unique though then aside from an aesthetic standpoint.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:00 AM;"You can argue that the most unique character is Feral Chaos too, because no one also does what he does.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:01 AM;I would argue everyone is pretty unique. Which is part of the great thing of Dissidia.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:01 AM;"When people argue that someone isn't unique, they usually fall back on aesthetics. And I feel like NT is doing better at making people unique.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:01 AM;Yunas animation can be replaces with a sword when ifrit is out;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:01 AM;No it can't.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:01 AM;Her long range is kinda like Terra;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;I can totally see that Mirron.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;And Kefka's Meteor is kind of like Laguna's rifle.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;In that they bounce.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;You can certainly stretch stuff to justify it.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;But I think it's silly when everyone is unique.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;No one character is _purely_ unique in Dissidia or 012.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;And that's okay.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;But I certainly don;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;"I toss granades without beam damage, my bouncing sniper is long range, my gun shoots, i can lazer nuke stuff. All facts";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;don't think that Laguna is more unique than the rest.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:02 AM;Agreed Treble.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:03 AM;Thats ok;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:03 AM;Being Unique isnt a compliment;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:03 AM;"Well, it isn't about being a compliment or not. And I'm saying everyone is.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:03 AM;I was just putting hard facts on the table;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:04 AM;The whole conversation started with you sayng Laguna was the most unique specialest snowflake in the roster lol.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:04 AM;Im a weird one to play as is all im saying cuz my moves are odd and creative;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:04 AM;You could replace all of Laguna's guns with spells and by the logic you espoused with Yuna Laguna wouldn't be unique at all.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:04 AM;"I... don't really agree with that except in the fact that they created a lot of moves for Laguna he didn't remotely use in the original VIII, which is creative.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:04 AM;It all comes down to preferences is the facts of it.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:05 AM;"My preference is magic users, but I still think Jecht and Prishe and such are unique, for example.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:05 AM;They were forced to get creative when doing Lagunas moves;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:05 AM;I mean to be honest Laguna was a strange choice for their third 8 rep;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:05 AM;My favorite characters to use are Prishe and Cloud tho not Laguna ever;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:05 AM;Yes and no.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;I'm not complaining about it;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;"He makes sense, but is kind of odd at the same time.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;Yeah;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;I'm hoping Rinoa joins.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;@Mirron#9949 iagree;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;He makes sense as the other main character of VIII;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;I'd like her to be a Heavy mage.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;But was an unconventional pick when they could have went with the OTHER OTHER main character;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;Mostly as a reference to her berserker mage quality.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;"Who is, yeah, Rinoa.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:06 AM;Im happy cuz Lagunas character interactions are more entertaining than anyone else in 8;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;"Eh, VIII dropped the ball hard on characters in general, that's not much of a bar to go over.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;Anyone that isn't Squall or Rinoa pretty much fades away.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;"Squall, Rinoa, or Seifer.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;I think Selphie would be fun to see interact;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;I thought it was a mistake to drop Edea from the party when you got to Esthar;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;That was a mistake;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;"I mean, Seifer is better off than the other PC's, but I don't think Seifer is all that good either.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:07 AM;... the redundancies increase the more tired i get.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;Or maybe Irvine or Zell;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;"Ultimecia arguably has something going for her too, but it's just Seifer-tier.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;"Aka not all that strong, but stronger than a lot of the others.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;"I think Edea, Ultimecia, Sefier, and Cid are all on the same level.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;Laguna I would place in the Seifer tier too.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;Nah;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;Laguna is;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;arguably;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;up there with squall and rinoa;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;But honestly Laguna is the most fun to see talk to the other FF characters;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:08 AM;He got entire segments devoted to him.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;"He got segments devoted to him, but that isn't quite the same as being developed.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;Remember when i met Cloud Of Darkness?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;That's fair;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;Lol;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;Maybe he is with Seifer et al;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;I'm not saying it's bad.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;I think that 8 would do well with a remake specifically to make better use of it's cast.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;It really could.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;It needs more of a remake than 7;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;Ideally more unique commands for the characters too.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;I would agree.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:09 AM;7 deserved it though;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;"I'm still mad we didn't get V and VI first, but.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;There are 10001 reasons why 7 was chosen and all are pretty clear;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;But 8 deserves it more;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;8 doesn't _deserve_ it more;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;It _needs_ it more.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;I'm happy with BNW for VI.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:10 AM;And its plot and theme would translate into todays modern games perfect in this gen;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;Of any game the one that I'd say deserves it more than 7 is 9.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;It's basically what I'd want for an FFVI remake so far.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;But that may also be personal prefence.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;BNW?;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;Brave New World. At least as far as mechanics go.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;Ahhh;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;They overhauled a lot of the mechanical qualities for FFVI.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;But 8 would make sense in thia time period we live in to new players;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;I want a 6 remake for the switch 🤷;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;And the changes they made are things I'd like.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;The graphics of 8 aged worse than 9;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:11 AM;8's time period would just mirror 15.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;Pretty much.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;Lol wow  @Treble#5035;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;It's true though.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;Bold af words;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;8 was made as a game set in the 1990's;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;Woooow;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;I'd like a new Crystal Chronicles for the Switch.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;A remake would be likely set in modern day.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;_Yes_;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;8's time period would just mirror 15.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:12 AM;I'm sad it seemed to die.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;Cant believe i red that;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;A Crystal Chronicles that's sort of like Dragon Age but Final Fantasy.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;It's true though?;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;It was really interesting. And I love Yukes.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;FF8 was the original fantasy based on reality.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;They're so quirky.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;The boldest harshest thing ive ever heard anyone say about 8;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;I kind of wish Layle and Amidatelion got into Dissidia.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;Up until we got flying Garden's the game was no more futuristic than the year it was made.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:13 AM;That VIII is meant to emulate the modern day?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;I think you misunderstood me;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;I mean... that seems like an odd thing to say is untrue.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;I wasn't comparing it to 15;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;That 8 is a mirror of 15???;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;I was saying they both did the fantasy based on reality thing.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;"Yeah, you misunderstood me.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;8 is way more fantasy than 15;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;A FF8 remake would mirror 15's _timeframe_ in that it would be based in 201X if made today.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:14 AM;"With smart phones, modern cars, etc.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;"8 is more fantasy than 15, but 8 is still meant to be a modern day kind of FF.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;Which is the entire point.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;It does have its modern day aspects but not in the same fashion as 15;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;7R is basically set in modern day too;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;The year in the original 7 is LITERALLY 2007;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;I would argue 7 in general is to an extent.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;Its kinda like saying 7 and 6 had machines so they are like 15;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;No it's really not.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;That isn't what is being said at all.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;I love 15 alot but wow;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:15 AM;However I can say that 9 and 6 are both steam fantasy games so they're similar.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:16 AM;"Is Final Fantasy VIII more directly inspired by the modern day relative to the majority of Final Fantasy games, yes or no?";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:16 AM;"If you say no, that means you're saying FFIX, for example, is as modern as FFVIII in terms of inspiration.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:16 AM;"One of them has cars and computers, the other does not.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;I feel like 8s cities and tech is closer to rotery phone age;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;It's not.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;It's pure late 90's.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;FFVIII has radios and satellites.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;I cant imagine a smartphone in 8 noway;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;Look at the Timber Maniacs building for instant;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;You must not paid attention to the world;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;"I mean, Laguna, you use a satellite laser in Dissidia.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:17 AM;That's literally what you'd see in a magazine office in 1998;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;Its set in old times;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;No it isn't.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;We had satalites back when we had rotery phones;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;Did we have desktops too?;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;We had cars too;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;"The earliest it could pass for is late 80's or early 90's but the design aesthetic in general, appearance of computers, trains, etc";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;And big computers too;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;says 90's;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;I said desktops.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;Not room-sized computers.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:18 AM;It's not just the tech that has me saying it's set in the 90's.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;"It's also Squall's high waisted pants, Zell's jorts, etc.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;Its asthetic is ment to mirror an older time piece;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;It's aesthetic is meant to mirror modern stuff.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;Nah 15 is doing that;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;_7 and 8 did it firsT_;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;"For it's time period, VIII was mirroring modern day stuff.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;15 just did it more CLEARLY.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;7 is its own made up world;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:19 AM;"XV may take it further, but that isn't the same thing.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:20 AM;"XV is a 10 on this scale, of taking from modern day stuff let's say. FFVIII is an 8.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:20 AM;"It takes from the modern day less than XV, but it still takes from it way, way more than any other FF has barring XV.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:20 AM;8 had a few real world similarities but wasnt as modern as it seems;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;It does have some tech but not too advanced;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;Personal computers.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;🤔;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;I can keep citing that.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;It had old 70s looking cars;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;Or 60s;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;Okay? Personal computers are still more modern than you're saying.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;True;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;And I can even go to the Internet.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:21 AM;Okay so here's the thing;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:22 AM;Im saying it had somethings more advanced than others;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:22 AM;8's design aesthetic wasn't meant to be Japanese or American unlike other FF games;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:22 AM;The design aesthetic of FF8;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:22 AM;is _european_;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:22 AM;"The design of the cars isn't classic, it's _european._";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:23 AM;It has mixed time tech;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:23 AM;I cant imagine a cell phone in 8 other than a walkie talkie;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:23 AM;But it has social networking and internet;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:23 AM;"As it is in 8, the current version of 8, the only type of cell phone they'd be using are those huge block ones.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:23 AM;But in a remake;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:24 AM;okay you just proved my point for me thanks;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:24 AM;Im saying it has mixed tech in it;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:24 AM;Guess when the internet was popularized;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:24 AM;Im not fully dissmissing what your saying;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;Im saying it has mixed tech but seems to reflect an older time piece;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;"It's not, though. It even says as much on it's wikipedia page.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;Before 2000s;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;Which admittedly can be edited by anyone.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;Im not worried about wikis i know all the areas in the game and have analysed it;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;"But the thing is that it's set in a mix of modern at the time times, with future tech.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:25 AM;And in a remake;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:26 AM;I don't think that would change.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:26 AM;It has a mix of modern and old tech;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:26 AM;Which is why instead of talking to the Timber Owls over a walkie when you're going to kidnap President Deling you'd probably be using a smart phone.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:26 AM;no it doesn't;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:26 AM;no more than real life does.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:26 AM;Ok then thats another game we saw 100% differant then;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:27 AM;Lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:27 AM;Im aware we have differant views on everything but thats ok :);;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:29 AM;"I mean I don't mean to be rude but right now it just feels like you're obstinate and want to argue over lots of things. xD As a general thing I think, and from a quick google search most people think the same, that FF8 is reality-based.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:29 AM;I think a lot of why you think it's not is because of the European design aesthetic.;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:30 AM;Woah thats the farthest away from how i feel lol;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:30 AM;I never wanted to argue;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:31 AM;I was close to saying that too about you but then took a step back and accepted we both feel 100% like what we are saying is obvious common sense and in the end I decided to feel that it is ok for us to feel differant ways;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:31 AM;We arent twins ya know;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:33 AM;No offense but im very forgiving and easy going;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:33 AM;I enjoy the idea that these games can be interprited multiple ways;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:34 AM;Thats my conclusion and closure for our entire convo from my perspective;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:35 AM;I did agree with your points and gave you full credibility but in your eyes i was wrong about everything i said from the start with FF10 till now with FF8 but thats ok;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:36 AM;Phew;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:36 AM;Lol;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:38 AM;"I think that's because I don't exactly understand where you're coming from, at least involving the whole tech standpoint, but eh.";;

Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 01:38 AM;"It's late, and I'm tired.";;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:38 AM;Go grab some rest;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:39 AM;Il be around if you ever wanna talk more;;
Laguna Loire#9791;18-Sep-17 01:39 AM;Or if you or anyone gets bored;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:51 AM;"@Adamthyst#1487 I don't think Cloud is interesting, I think that Zack is interesting.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:52 AM;"When it comes down to it the Cloud that we see through most of FF7 is just... Zack. It's Zack's personality imprinted on Cloud, who _COULD_ have been written as having dissosciative identity disorder, but wasn't.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:52 AM;"And then he's just a basic JRPG protagonist through the end of the game, and when we actually see Cloud's true self in Advent Children he's... whiny and angsty.";;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:53 AM;He was poisoned from all the Mako experiments though;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 07:53 AM;At least in AC he is his true self;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 07:53 AM;I liked him more there;;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:53 AM;He's way better in 7 imo;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:53 AM;That's the thing;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:54 AM;He's not himself in 7 _because he thinks he's Zack_;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:54 AM;So he just... acts like Zack.;;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:54 AM;I hate it when people call him angsy because that's just who he isn't lmao;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:54 AM;"We don't see who Cloud is until Advent Children, and to be fair if I had played 7 as a kid instead of watching it and most compilation stuff, I might feel differently about that.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;"But going back and replaying the game I realize that we're given a lead character with a false identity who, in his game, is never given the chance to actually show who _he_ is as a character.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;"Instead, we see him with another character's personality.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;And that could have been made interesting but I don't think that they capitalized on it.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;"Cloud isn't even that aignsty in 7, aside from a few moments";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;"He is not, thats the point";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;"And yeah, Cloud in AC is a total 180 from Cloud in 7, but that's the point.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:55 AM;Because it's not Cloud in 7.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:56 AM;If you like Cloud in 7 then the character that you like is Zack Fair.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 07:56 AM;tfw my first exposer to Cloud was AC and KH2;;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:56 AM;It becomes him once you dive inside his head lol;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;Diving into his head is another issue that I have tbh but less because you dive into his head and more because of what it does to Tifa afterward.;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;"Ill be the devils advocate, I dont think Cloud represents Zack decently in the parts that he is impersonating Zack";;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;°;;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;^;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;Zack is way better than Cloud was trying to be;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;Lmao;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;"She was more interesting to me in the lead role than Cloud was, showed more personality during that bit than she had through the whole game, but from that point on she's relegated to more or less the background as just 'Cloud's girlfriend' and that bothers me.";;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:57 AM;Cloud's not my favorite protagonist but he's a good one;;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:58 AM;I wouldn't call her Clouds GF either;;
Adamthyst#1487;18-Sep-17 07:58 AM;That's completely wrong lol;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:58 AM;"That's the thing though, is it?";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:58 AM;After that point she loses all characterization unless it's about Cloud.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 07:58 AM;Yeah tifa was actually a pretty strong character till then wasn't she;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:59 AM;Mhmm;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:59 AM;Tifa carried the story to me up until the point that you repair Cloud's psyche.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:59 AM;At least after the end of Disc 1;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 07:59 AM;"Up to the end of disc 1, it's Aerith who carries the story.";;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 07:59 AM;To be fair most character development dies after the cloud psyche stuff;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;Yeah but that's where the story criticism comes in;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;I don't think it should've.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;_But_;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;I think that can and will be improved with the remake.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;Story dev dies at part 3;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;I get the feeling that I'm going to like 7R more than I like vanilla 7;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;Which only have the final dungeon anyway;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:00 AM;7 could take a page from XVs character development;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;It needs to take a page from 9;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;7R will probably have many things cut down;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;No?;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;Specially the vulgar stuff;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;Because... You know;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;"If anything things will be expanded, most of the vulgarity was translation error.";;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;"2017/2018, sadly";;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;Hasn't trap cloud been confirmed;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:01 AM;we already know that crossdressing cloud™ is happening;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;But how it's going to happen?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;(which if we don't get the opportunity to just play the whole game with cloud in his dress i'll be slightly disappointed);;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;That's the point;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;Mfw Vivi's arc 😭;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;Likely the same way.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;We'll see;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:02 AM;"They aren't making these games for kids, mature content has it's place.";;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:03 AM;Ff7 is G in Australia;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:03 AM;Which is surprising considering their are games banned for having gay people;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:04 AM;"7R will likely have a different rating than 7, at least parts of it.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:04 AM;In Australia at the least.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:04 AM;Because times ARE more sensitive but that doesn't mean they need to cut content just because something might be a bit vulgar or explicit.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:04 AM;"FF7/8/9 G, FFX MA15+";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:04 AM;Corneo and Hojo are going to be just as rapey as they were in the original games.;;

Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:05 AM;"Hojo maybe moreso, if they add Vincent backstory.";;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:05 AM;Their rapeyness will be more real too;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:05 AM;Hojo amazes me as to how creepy he is despite actually pretty low screen time;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:05 AM;Inb4 flat Tifa;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:05 AM;"no, please";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;Tifa will be as flat as she was in Dissidia and AC;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;And KH;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;Which I mean to be fair wasn't very.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;She just didn't have Lara Croft boobs.;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;Im fine with that;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;"You mean, triangle ones?";;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;KH tifa is my favourite incarnation of her;;

Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;Aaaaa;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;Also Lara's breast size was a development mistake;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;That they just;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;kept;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:06 AM;It was like oop we made boob too big but it ok;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:07 AM;Or as Bob Ross calls it;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:07 AM;She ended up defined by it so it was probably for the best.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:07 AM;A happy little accident;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:07 AM;"Its fiiine, it'll attract players :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:07 AM;Yuffie I'd like to see more of;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:07 AM;She was my favourite character after Tifa;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;"Well, Im not worried much about 7R tbh";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;I still think Yuffie and Vincent will be made mandatory and given their own character arcs.;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;Not my favourite in the series by a long shot;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;Because they need to do something to fill the story up if it's going to be _three games long._;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;(I actually don't like Vincent);;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;So expect more of basically everyone.;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;But I think it'll be important for the future of the series;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:08 AM;Gimme more remakes;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;Crisis core needs a HD remake;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;FF8 and FF9 will have 7R styled remakes for sure.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;But maybe not _three games long._;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;I'd play the fuck out of that;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;It seems like you two think they can do anything with 7R;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;5 and 6 on the other hand;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;Hopefully not 9… wouldnt fit at all;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;Just remember it's not going to be VII-2;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;"Will be more like WOFF, at least appearance-wise.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;Marce;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;"Well, they CAN do anything";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:09 AM;Buddy;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;You're underestimating what they can and what they _have to_ do.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;The basic plot outline will be the same but it HAS to be extrapolated upon.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;I'd like just a ffiv ds type remake for 5 and 6;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;The games are fine as is;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;I want it on Switch tbh;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;What they have to do or what **you** want then to do?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;Which would probably make it look better by default.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;No.;;

Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;What they _HAVE_ to do.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;Maybe just a bit of refinement;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;They'll do what gives them more money;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:10 AM;You're forgetting that 7 is being remade into more than 40 hour long game.;;

Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:11 AM;We know very little about it yet.;;

Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:11 AM;Including ATTEMPTING a XV port;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:12 AM;So I think that 5 and 6 remakes being on the Switch is a thing they'll be interested in;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:12 AM;Also;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:12 AM;one sec;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:12 AM;* the director of XV said he wanted to port it to switch;;

Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;It'd be the PERFECT swerve.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;Have her die later on;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;The general audience is likely unfamiliar with FF7;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;After the snow area;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;Aerith funeral lol;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;That'd freak people out;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;"Advertise her as the lead or co-lead, and then _SUDDENLY_...";;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 08:23 AM;Now you are ruining great original scenes;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;"but, when cloud drops her on the water";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;isnt it like her funeral?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;But nah I genuinely think that game 1 will be disc 1.;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;Thats when he drowns her;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;but thats just a theory;;
jelly#6969;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;A GAME THEORY;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;"The climax is the battle with Jenova before Aerith dies, and then her death in the following scene. It ends with the funeral scene.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;I actually think that's a given.;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 08:24 AM;Its a nice ending for the disc 1;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:26 AM;It's a nice depressing ending that makes you want more because you want payback.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 08:26 AM;Especially if they advertise her as the co-lead of the game.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 10:02 AM;"I mean she is kind of critical for the story, even if it's not as direct.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:07 AM;"Hah, to be fair, I think even non-fans knows about Aerith these days";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:09 AM;It's borderline I am your father. levels at this point.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:11 AM;And the EU cover has it as a massive spoiler on the back so there's that!;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:12 AM;https://www.hellandheavennet.com/final-fantasy-7/images/boxeu2_small.jpg;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:12 AM;"Pfft, he's just tucking her in to bed.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:13 AM;"Ahh yes, her watery bed.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:13 AM;Yes.  Or he's teaching her how to swim.  Just ignore the fact that they're not wearing swimsuits.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:14 AM;There's no spoilers if you have imagination.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:14 AM;"😆  teaching her to swim. It does look like he could be teaching her how to float on her back, which is essential!";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:15 AM;Her eyes are just closed because she's nervous.  It's her first time swimming.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:15 AM;And last.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:16 AM;"Well yeah, Cloud just let go of her and she started to sink.  I wouldn't go swimming either if I didn't float naturally as people do.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:17 AM;"I mean, what else could that image mean?  That Aerith died and Cloud is laying her body to rest?  That she would continue to reappear in the series as a helpful ghost/angel/thing with a completely different personality?";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:17 AM;"It would have been anticlimatic if Aerith had just slowly floated away across the lake, spinning in place.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:18 AM;That's true.  I guess Cetra just aren't as buoyant as standard humans though.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:18 AM;Or they stuffed her dress with rocks.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:19 AM;Or it was all the stolen equipment weighing her down.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:20 AM;I bet Tifa made sure she was gonna sink to prevent Cloud from trying to use a phoenix down or pulling a Locke.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:20 AM;"'Oh she's really dead Cloud' 'Are you sure Tifa, she might be breathin-' 'NO SHE'S DEAD. Throw her in the lake'";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:22 AM;"Hey look I think she's opening her eyes!  No Cloud, it's just a trick of the light.  I am the only love interest now.  Stop mourning her and pay attention to me.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:22 AM;"Watch out Barret, you're next.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:23 AM;I hope no one told Tifa about that date.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Sep-17 10:23 AM;Poor Barret.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:23 AM;He's so lonely.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:24 AM;I don't think he even had a love interest in Corel.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:24 AM;He was just Dyne's third wheel.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:24 AM;His wife was just his beard.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:25 AM;I thought his one true love was his undying hatred of Shinra.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:26 AM;"It's Cid/Vincent/Cait Sith. Or on a nicer note, I always did like the idea of him having something with Elmyra.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:27 AM;Wait I forgot that Cid/Barret is the confirmed ship now.  But Elmyra would've been nice.  I think they'd both be good for each other.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:28 AM;She isn't afraid to tell him when he's being an idiot. She adores Marlene. What more could he want? A little mismatched family that have all lost and found someone.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:30 AM;A little slice of happiness to come out of all the tragedy that consumed their lives.  I hope they did end up as a family.  It would be nice.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:30 AM;With crazy uncle Cloud.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:32 AM;"If Cetra can't float I guess that confirms that the Spirans are ancestors to everyone else. Does that make them genocidal, then, since they killed off all the Cetra? What would Braska say? 🤔";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:33 AM;Well there is the theory that FFX/FFX-2 is set before FFVIII!;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:33 AM;The character Shinra in FFX-2 has the idea for creating energy from the planet.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:33 AM;The theory that Square hints at being real and is the only one they didn't specifically deconfirm in their debunking fan theories interview.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:34 AM;They confirmed it as being real actually;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:34 AM;Iirc;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:34 AM;"I just assume that it's true, and the regular people of VII's Gaia are descendents of Spirans who traveled there in the distant past.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:34 AM;Really? I mean the set up was there.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:35 AM;Shinra's descendant invents space travel and discovers Gaia;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:35 AM;They like to dance around it being confirmed while also pretty much saying it's real.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:35 AM;The descendant's descendant is Rufus Shinra;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:35 AM;That is interesting! I always thought Spira eventually became Gaia;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:35 AM;But that admittedly makes more sense;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:36 AM;I thought so at first too! I suppose that it being a whole new world is better than the threat of lowering sea levels.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:37 AM;Being a new world helps explain why Zanarkand and Bevelle aren't still around on Gaia.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:37 AM;"I and IX have the same world map and are both called Gaia, featuring the same archfiends, though. So that might be a thing 👀";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:37 AM;I think IX is more of a homage type deal.  Although Terra from IX might be the orignal Gaia.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:38 AM;"So Ancients were already on Gaia, and the humans came with Shinra? Or were humans there already? Wow, in that case, it does make them like Jenova.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:38 AM;Yeah IX was intended as an homage but it would be a neat connection.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:39 AM;Both landing on a planet intending to take it's energy for their own. Interesting...;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:39 AM;https://thelifestream.net/canon-of-ffvii/is-ffvii-connected-to-ffx-and-x-2/;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:39 AM;"The details of it are sketchy.  All humanity on Gaia might've been descended from Spirans, it could just be the normal humans and the Cetra being the original population of Gaia.  We don't particularly know because the only detail of the theory is Shinra.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:40 AM;Okay so maybe the descendant doesn't invent space travel but I was right about everything else!;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:40 AM;The thing about Spirans is that they are generally normal humans.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:41 AM;"So it would be safe to assume that the spirans are what came to be Gaia's humans when they interbred with the Cetra, and eventually the Cetra bloodline would need to die out except for in Aerith.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:41 AM;"Yeah, I think that idea makes more sense.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:42 AM;I also like the idea that Jenova followed the Spirans to Gaia.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:42 AM;Or maybe the Spirans fled Spira to escape Jenova.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:42 AM;And it followed. That's explain why they hid when she showed up again.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:42 AM;I know someone who suggested that;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:42 AM;And that the big bad of X 3 could be Jenova;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:43 AM;That would be a much better way to do X-3 compared to what's been hinted at in the audio drama's and stuff;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:43 AM;"Which is that people just don't die anymore and the dead are coming back, including Sin.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:44 AM;Honestly just based on will X 3 as is would heavily rehash X;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:44 AM;What audio drama? There is no audio drama.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:44 AM;Which would be fine for an act or 2 but if that's the whole game I'd be piiissseedds;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:44 AM;Right silly me.  Square didn't make an audio drama.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:44 AM;So if they wanna take that and then add Jenova to it I'd be down;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:44 AM;Also _true_;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:45 AM;What would be interesting is if Sin/the dead coming back was just Jenova messing with the population like it first did with the Cetra.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;"Jenova could actually be a creation of the Farplane if they wanted, too. Hence why she can manipulate pyreflies and be kept alive by Lifestream";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;"In fact, I believe when Tidus comes back to life in one of the post X-2 stories, Yuna describes him as Not Tidus anymore";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;If he was a Jenova replicant it would make sense.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;"Yeah, in x 2.5";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;That's why they break up in will;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;"Okay, that makes sense!";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:46 AM;Someone call Nomura!;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:47 AM;"I'd be fine with Jenova still being a cosmic horror, not a spawn of the Farplane and that Spira was just it's most recent destination.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:48 AM;"Yeah, the fact that Jenova has no origin as such adds to the horror of her.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:48 AM;"I think it could go either way. I suggested the Farplane bit to explain how she'd control the beckoned, since they aren't exactly replicants.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:48 AM;It's not even known if they've got physical forms I think?;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:48 AM;Tho the perfect ending of x 2 implies they dl;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:48 AM;Do;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:49 AM;"It could all just tricks of Jenova.  I could see her being able to interact with/infect/manipulate the Farplane like how she was able to infect the Lifestream, but I'd rather keep her alien origin.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:50 AM;Yeah ultimately I'd be fine with that. It would be a really decent twist for Tidus too;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:50 AM;That isn't what we already know or a rehash of the sixth sense / auron;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:51 AM;"It would also be really neat because we'd get to see Jenova as a villain in her own right, not just being controlled by Sephiroth.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:51 AM;If only! I'd love for that to come true.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:52 AM;This would be a great way to tie the inevitable X-3 in with VIIR as well.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:52 AM;Tbh I can see something like this happening;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:52 AM;"If it does happen, I'll be incredibly impressed";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:53 AM;X-3 is more or less confirmed and you know how SE is with VII;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:53 AM;"That page you linked is great, by the way! Thank you!";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:53 AM;No problem 💖;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:54 AM;X-3 has been talked about so much I take it as the next big game Square will announce.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:54 AM;I'd be... intrigued if it was.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:54 AM;"They've hinted at it a lot, along with something new with VI and an VIII remake.";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 10:54 AM;"I havent heard about X-3, what people are saying it would be about?";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:55 AM;"Well the official released post X-2 material is that the dead, including Sin, are coming back to life.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:55 AM;But we've been speculating that it might all just be Jenova based on the VII-X connection theory.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:55 AM;"Okay, I love the theory that Cid is so great with mechanics because he has some Al Bhed in his bloodline.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:55 AM;He does have blond hair.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:56 AM;"He does! And he's, inadvertingly most likely, named after the leader.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:56 AM;And the Cid of X was an Al Bhed.  Cid might just be an Al Bhed name.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:56 AM;Could be a name passed down from father to son.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:56 AM;"The reason behind it faded, but the name stayed.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:56 AM;Is Brother's real name Cid then?;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:57 AM;Because his actual name can't be Brother.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:57 AM;I refuse to believe that.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:57 AM;"Maybe it's like how kids are officially called their father's name, but they're known by a nickname.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:58 AM;"This is late but the official stance on x-3 is that it will happen, but it will take time.";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 10:58 AM;"Yeah, it seems likely that it's going to happen. At some point.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 10:59 AM;X is in the top 3 favorite FF games amongst the community with VI and VII.  If they're going to remake VII they might as well start milking X too.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 10:59 AM;"There are three games that, if I were SE, I'd be considering for the major release of 2018 since Dissidia is a spin off.";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:00 AM;They already did with the pc port;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:00 AM;"Those are remakes of 5 and 6, and X-3.";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:00 AM;Im positive that they made lots of money with the remaster;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:00 AM;They're intentionally keeping X relevant;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:00 AM;There are rumors now of a port to the One last I heard;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:00 AM;FFX on the Xbone would be so weird.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:01 AM;I can see it happening.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:01 AM;What they're doing is keeping interest alive so that when X-3 is revealed there's more hype.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:01 AM;Even if it DOESN'T these rumors do what they need it to.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:01 AM;Which is keep people talking.;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 11:01 AM;So would Yuna be the MC for FFX-3? I'd definitely not be opposed to that.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:02 AM;I think it would be like X;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:02 AM;Yuna and Tidus as co-leads;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:02 AM;If our rampant speculation is right and Tidus is a Jenova manifestation then I think Yuna as the PC makes sense.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:02 AM;There's also Chuami and Kurgum tho;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 11:02 AM;Doesn't Yuna have some male OC? He could be her co-lead.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:03 AM;If it isn't Tidus and/or Yuna I expect it would be Chuami;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:03 AM;"Yeah, that's Kurgum. I feel like he's a Secret Bad Guy™";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:04 AM;Was there ever any connection between main final fantasy titles worlds?;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:04 AM;"I mean, confirmed";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:04 AM;"It depends on how they play X-3.  If Tidus is actually Tidus and Yuna is just needlessly making drama then yeah I suspect Yuna's love interest will be bad guy or die off.  But if Tidus is actually dead and is Jenova or something crazy like that, her new love interest might be legit.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:04 AM;Some people think X and VII are connected iirc;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:04 AM;X and VII are pretty much confirmed to be connected.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:04 AM;There's a pretty strong case for III and VIII as well.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:05 AM;Can't remember what the premise of that was though;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:05 AM;I don't think she has a legit other love interest;;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 11:05 AM;I really hope that Chuami isn't Auron's daughter. That would suck. I'm fine with her believing it though but... please no.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:05 AM;She made that up to break up with Tidus tbh;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:05 AM;What's the theory for 3 and 8 being connected?;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:05 AM;Shinra in X-2 discovers mako energy at the end of the game.  Spira eventually develops space travel and goes to Gaia where Shinra's descendents found the Shin-Ra corporation.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:06 AM;Let me find a link to one of those blogs that gives all the evidence;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:06 AM;"I know 7 and 10 and 1 and 9, but not 3 and 8";;
Aruu#2066;18-Sep-17 11:06 AM;"Also you can argue that FFI and FFIX can be the same planet, but that's because FFIX has a similar map, crystals, and is kinda barren";;

Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:07 AM;"Tbh I dont believe those theories too much, but its interesting taking a look at them";;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:07 AM;There was once a theory about XIII world being connected to other FF world that I dont remember which one was;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:07 AM;Gonna take a look;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:07 AM;There also might be a connection with VIII and IV based on that monsters come from the moon in VIII and there's a lot of moon related alien stuff in IV.;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:11 AM;I can see the 3 and 8 stuff;;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:11 AM;"Like yeah that would be cool, and even if it isn't true then there's a ton of callbacks.";;
Treble#5035;18-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"As for the crystals it's more than possible they just became a natural part of the world, hence why magic seems more naturalized.";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"I like the idea that the crystals are just physical manifestations of the Lifestream.  Like every FF world has them, sometimes they appear as real objects like the 4 elemental crystals, othertimes they dissolve back into the Planet and become the Lifestream of the Farplane or whatever makes the Draw Points in VIII.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"`X and VII are prtty much confirmed to be connected.`, , not pretty much, I think there was an Ultimania that outright stated it";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:19 AM;devs do that because they don't want to specifically say something is one way in fear of being pressured to make something that ties it all up;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:19 AM;they could be like Valve and not make games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:19 AM;I know other devs who do the same thing;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:19 AM;they could be like Bethesda and say they're gonna release good games but then release bad games;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:20 AM;they could be like Ubisoft and kill their series;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:20 AM;That's exactly what they're doing though;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:22 AM;good move;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:22 AM;one of my apartment mates unironically likes it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:22 AM;he's also bad at video games though so;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:22 AM;I saw a clip of a Krogan talking once and really annoyed because it didn't sound like a Krogan.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:22 AM;apparently people like the game now;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;it's a shame;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;the trilogy was my favorite;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;well not really;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;but I loved it;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;"but as sonic said there, its been patched";;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;Give them the original ME trilogy.;;

Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;How even.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;What.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;How do you what.;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;Horizon is one of the best games to come out in the past few years.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;you know what I find funny;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:23 AM;he thinks andromeda is more enguaging and doesn't see how people like horizon at all;;
Dinoken2#0946;18-Sep-17 11:24 AM;How do you even put Andromeda in the same sentence as it?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:24 AM;Assassin's Creed has the best DLC model I've seen in recent years;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:24 AM;I almost wrote him out of my life for saying such things;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:25 AM;...LOL;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:25 AM;AC used to be so good;;
Bazo#5158;18-Sep-17 11:25 AM;Ezio's trilogy was awesome;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:25 AM;even though it doesn't incoorporate the good qualities of one;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:26 AM;"eh AC is still decent, like half the games post Ezio were pretty enjoyable in general";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:26 AM;they just needed to not fucking release one every year;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:26 AM;Ezio's arc is the only part of AC that I like tbh;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:26 AM;I'm like a stereotypical member of /r/assassinscreed because I'm unironically invested in the modern day storyline;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Sep-17 11:27 AM;looked interesting;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:29 AM;"also I still think AC1 is a very fun game if you do all the investigations, look at and read the maps and letters they provide, and plan out the assassinations in advance, it's fun to try to see if you can get in and out without fighting anyone but your target, , and the emails on the Abstergo servers are some of the most interesting emails in the game, especially the ones in the secret room, , but like I said I'm a bit more invested than most";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 11:31 AM;that reminds me I need to finish Freedom Cry;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:15 PM;fun fact;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:15 PM;based on my knowledge of Hebrew;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:16 PM;that word is feminine;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:16 PM;so basically even Sephiroth's name calls him feminine;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:16 PM;That's deeper than I imagined;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;The battle itself was weird;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot, , I'm looking at the translations of the names of each Sefirah and none of these describe Sephiroth";;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;"After the last flashback, he didn't say a word";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;yeah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;you just kinda go into your mind;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;omnislash his presence within your mind;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;18-Sep-17 10:17 PM;and then the game ends;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:18 PM;Also his sudden morphs;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:19 PM;"But as you mentioned, it's poetic";;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:19 PM;That's pretty interesting;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:19 PM;I'll be doing some in-depth reading about VII's story;;
Marcello#4574;18-Sep-17 10:20 PM;Definitely not going to start VIII any time soon;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 11:14 PM;ouch;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Sep-17 11:26 PM;Even though your average adult/human needs about 8 hours of sleep;;

monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 03:19 AM;"well it's been forever but i finally beat lightning returns, lmao";;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 03:20 AM;"i hadn't beaten it before because i thought i beat it because resetting to try again forces you into NG+, somehow";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:53 AM;I actually think FFX has one of the strongest endings in the series;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:54 AM;Oh it absolutely does.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:54 AM;It was the perfect ending to one of the strongest stories in the series.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:54 AM;There's just that by nature of the post-credits scene it necessitated a sequel.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:54 AM;"Tidus coming back wasn't a X-2 invention, X-2 was a rationalization to Tidus coming back.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:55 AM;Also - I think it's interesting how in both X and X-2 you can be inactive enough during boss fights that the world literally ends.;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:55 AM;I did not know that;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 10:55 AM;It breaks my heart everytime the Fayth turn into stone and the bubbles with the dreams get released.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 10:56 AM;"And it cuts to Tidus smiling, then looking down as he notices he is fading.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:56 AM;"Didn't know which part, Jelly?";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:56 AM;"Also yeah, that's heartbreaking. And how he just accepts it.";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:56 AM;The if you are inactive the world ends;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;Oh yeah.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;Sin and Vegnagun can both destroy spira.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;"At least if I recall correctly, I may be wrong.";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;I'm replaying FFX-international atm;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;"The facial animations were incredible too. Tidus holding back his words, trying to think of what to say so Yuna doesn't cry.";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;I'll have to check it out;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:57 AM;Vegnagun absolutely can.;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:58 AM;I haven't played X-2 in ages;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 10:58 AM;I'm not even sure if I beat it;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:59 AM;I think I might be wrong about Sin being able to destroy Spira;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 10:59 AM;But Vegnagun can;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:00 AM;IDK why I thought that now lmao;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:00 AM;I think X-2 is worth it but maybe hard to get into at first by nature of the first two chapters being reliant on missions and not being linear.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:00 AM;I'm still getting used to the combat system.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:01 AM;Too fast paced in comparison?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:01 AM;Yeah.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:01 AM;And I don't like how the ATB bar has to fill up again just to use one ITEM.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:01 AM;Yeah I can understand that.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:01 AM;"Shit, I'm at 20, uh, lemme use Potion.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:02 AM;Though at least the atb bar itself is smaller if you use an item.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:02 AM;*Enemy kills Paine mid charging.*;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:02 AM;That'll get MUCH easier later when you're less fleshy and have the Alchemist dress-sphere.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:03 AM;One of the skills for Alchemist cuts the atb for item stuff down a _lot._;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:03 AM;Ohshit.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:03 AM;"Speaking of Dresspheres, they are absolutely ridicu--";;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:04 AM;"*Yuna changes to warrior, pulls out Tidus' sword.*";;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:04 AM;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:04 AM;The dresspheres were inspired by magical girl anime so that's why the changes are like they are when you have cutscenes on.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:05 AM;"I think that those aside (bc divisive opinions) that would be the best way to do a job system in future titles that have it, so you can change on the fly.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:05 AM;Just have the changes happen like they do with the scenes off though;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:06 AM;I actually really like the idea of having a character have one job only the whole game;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:06 AM;That you have to pick;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:07 AM;Like the way XII TZA's licenses are? I dig that too;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:07 AM;Though I think it REALLY works because they allow you to choose two.;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:07 AM;Yeah;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:07 AM;Makes meta gaming super fun too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:08 AM;I think that idea is very one sided;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:08 AM;But I wish they kept the option of the original system as well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:08 AM;"III, V, and Tactics have the right idea of being able to change throughout the game";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:08 AM;"I just think the way X-2 does it, allowing you to change on the fly in battle, allows you to adapt as you see fit.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:09 AM;"The XIII series did it as well, LR more than the other two by virtue of what the Paradigm Shift _is_";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:09 AM;X-2 is fine except the idea of having to go back and forth or to go through other jobs just to get to what you want is annoying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:10 AM;I do like XIII saga's take on being able to change instantly;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:10 AM;Yeah that's the bit that I would change.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:10 AM;especially in LR;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:11 AM;I still have to play that;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:11 AM;Never beat XIII-2 though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:12 AM;the biggest thing XIII-2 did to the battle system was make it so that you didn't have to look at each character shift;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:12 AM;every fucking time;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:12 AM;I'd beat XIII-2 before you play LR but that's just because the end of XIII-2 leads directly into LR.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:12 AM;XIII-2 and LR are like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:12 AM;their own little thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:13 AM;the first game you can skip or listen to the synopsis in XIII-2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:14 AM;but it isn't required to get grasp the plot of its sequels;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:14 AM;only the context of the first hour of XIII-2 is lost by not playing the first game;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:14 AM;Yeah it basically tells you everything else you need to know;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:14 AM;XIII-2 and LR are less self contained between each other.;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"That's what made me lose interest tbh, Because I actually didn't care about anything else I just wanted to continue XIIIs story";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:15 AM;Then I realised it only sort of mattered;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:15 AM;well XIII's story had complete closure;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;The story matters but because it had closure XIII-2 had to be revisionist.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;which is why the sequels didn't make any sense for existing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;the game didn't need any continuation at all;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;Even X-2 sort of matters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;but I look at XIII-2 and LR as happy accidents;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;"When it comes down to it, XIII-2 COULDN'T exist without XIII, but XIII isn't necessarily important to t outside of a few things";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;story isn't that great but they are much more fun games;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:16 AM;X-2 matters a lot in the scheme of things because of what I mentioned earlier.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;XIII is important as backstory;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;that's all;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;X was the first time that an ending or post-ending in FF necessitated a revisitaton.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;X had a perfect ending.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;"In fact, I think X-2 would have been better if Tidus wasn't involved.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;It's the post-credit scene that necessitates it.;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;"XIII didn't need a continuation, X at least sort of justifies one";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:17 AM;^;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;My mind and heart are fighting over what's best.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;"X would've been fine ending after the original game, let's be real.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;X didn't need one either tbh;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;It doesn't because Square wanted to give us a happy ending.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;"For the X tragedy to stay, or for Tidus to come back happily.";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;VII didn't need a prequel but it actually worked;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;It worked for fangirls for sure---;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;I think with the X universe what's unnecessary is anything after X-2.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;but I feel like everytime they try to expand on X's universe it gets worse;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;^^^^°;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:18 AM;They literally _ruin_ the perfect ending by injecting X-2.5 in there.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;If it ended with just the first game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;I'd been solid;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;@BrunoBunno#1489 CC is fun 😡;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;"X-3 could still be good but I don't have high hopes, and I liked X-2 for what it was";;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;"CC sure is fun, no doubt.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;I cried at the ending.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;"But everytime I think of CC, Genesis fanart pops up.";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:19 AM;But I have a _real_ problem with X-2.5 ruining the point of the Perfect Ending of X-2.;;

Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:21 AM;Also I'm gonna be honest I couldn't care less about the compilation of VII;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:21 AM;But that might be because I don't like VII much in the first place.;;

BrunoBunno#1489;20-Sep-17 11:27 AM;the whole X-2 deal with Setting Spira for centuries to come useless because they just...up and leave it?;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:28 AM;"This was thousands of years ago, the Spirans probably lost all their tech and tech knowledge due to Jenova";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:28 AM;"We were talking yesterday about how Jenova could've been the reason they left Spira, though there's nothing tellng us that they fully abandoned it.";;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:29 AM;The X and VII connection does explain the whole sperate cetra species though;;
jelly#6969;20-Sep-17 11:29 AM;Humans are literally alien colonists;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:29 AM;It was even posited that Jenova could be the actual main villain in a game explaining how that happens or some such and we could actually see her as a villain in her own right;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:29 AM;Which I'd kill for;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:29 AM;I think that Gaians (Humans) are the result of Spirans and Cetra interbreeding.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 11:29 AM;So even without Aerith being the last cetra the cetra DNA strand would've died off either way.;;

Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:10 PM;🤷 I don't think it's going to be a strict remake. To remake something is to make something again with the same _exact_ premise. To reboot to start something again.

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:15 PM;"the thing is, you're acting like what they're changing is enough for it to be considered as such";;

Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;We don't know.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;"A reboot doesn't inherently mean a story will b different, as evidenced by numerous examples.";;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;We know next to nothing about the FFVII Remake. Nothing at all.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;^;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;So while the VII Remake will have the same base concept we also know it'll have to add things for it to be as long as they want it to be.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;they have not given us anything to even think that it is going to reboot FFVII;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;"So yes, it's also a reinterpreation.";;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;Well FFVII is a huge game as it stands.;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;I'm afraid of them adding anything;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:24 PM;and they are marketting the game as a remake;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;hence the name;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;"When SE adds something, it's usually just for milking the game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;FF7**Remake**;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;not FF7Reboot;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;or Final Fantasy: FF7;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;yeah but a secret dungeon at the end or some optional minigames don't hurt anyone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;or some other weird name;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;if they were going to reboot VII;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;"7 isn't as big as they need it to be to fill more than one game though, let's be real.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;they would've said so by now;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:25 PM;"wait what, it's gonna be multiple games?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;they would not have shown us stuff that are 100% callbacks to the original game;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;Yes.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;It's going to be more than one game.;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;why;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;talk about milking LMAO;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;yes the game will be split amoung several different games;;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;Because of the sheer amount of content they want to put into each 'game'.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;none of which we know nothing about;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;So much milk.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;"We do know something about them, though.";;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;I seem to vaguely recall them wanting to flesh out the world.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:26 PM;"They're three, full length games meant to tell the story of the original Final Fantasy 7.";;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;"the new form of pre-planned dlc is:, releasing your game as multiple games, each costing $50+";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;all we know is how long they **plan** for the games to be;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;We also know that in the first game you'll be able to walk through the entirely of Midgard.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;and even then that can end up being different;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;"okay, maybe not three. I keep assuming that.";;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;maybe they plan to include advent children shit;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;or crisis whatever;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;idk i havent played that shit;;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;They'll include Crisis Core for certain.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;I think what they intend to do is include stuff from the compilation and certain cut content elements.;;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;And... that means Genesis.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;I wouldn't be surprised to see the other members of Red XIII's race.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-17 12:27 PM;Genesis is the best.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;He hads such charm to VII when it was so Loveless before.;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;Can we all agree now it will not be a reboot?;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;we should;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;because unless they change the name;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;or tell us outright;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;it is nowhere near a reboot;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;maybe the plot twist;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;is that it's called a remake;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;but is a reboot;;
Aruu#2066;20-Sep-17 12:28 PM;Yeah reboot isn't quite the right word for it.;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;maybe sephiroth kills cloud and you play as aerith for the rest of the game;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;To be honest I'm not sure if it's either a remake or a reboot.;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;"If they reboot the game, they will get so much shit from everyone";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;It's sort of;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;both;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;I thought VII remake was resetting the lore?;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;and neither.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;SEE THANK YOU;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;That's part of what I thought to;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;What people have been telling me is that the compilation is being retconned.;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;Nope;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;We know nothing about it;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:29 PM;Almost nothing*;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:30 PM;And that one bit of knowledge doesn't tell much;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:30 PM;by the way is anyone excited for the ffxv comrades dlc or is that just me;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:30 PM;"Though, moving on from debates";;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:30 PM;They apparently revealed new bits from the last trailer at the Distant Worlds concert;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:30 PM;Teeny tiny pieces.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:30 PM;But still 🤷;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:31 PM;when have they said that it was resetting anything;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:31 PM;all of these assumptions;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 12:31 PM;"```They apparently revealed new bits from the last trailer at the Distant Worlds concert```, REBOOT";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:31 PM;but no proof;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:32 PM;but otherwise I am not excited;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:32 PM;Honestly though what this entire conversation comes down to is that we need to know more about this.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:32 PM;i understand they haven't been able to focus on it because of kingdom hearts 3 but kh3 is releasing next year.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:33 PM;it's time to _start_ focusing if they want to get this game released before the next decade.;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:33 PM;i like character creation and co-op multiplayer;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:33 PM;so im excited for it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:33 PM;I do too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:33 PM;but;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:34 PM;"I have the Souls series to satisfy that urge, so the same thing happening in FFXV isn't as appealing to someone who frequently plays through them";;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:34 PM;@Treble#5035 i keep seeing that picture and thinking it's alexander in the distance;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:34 PM;and going by what a lot of the criticisms were when the first demo came out for the co-op;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:34 PM;it doesn't seem to be all that fun;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:34 PM;ffxiv is fun too if you're into mmos;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:35 PM;and yeah i willl definitely wait and see what people are saying before spending money on comrades;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:35 PM;i have FFXIV;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:35 PM;😦;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:35 PM;but I can't stand the base game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:35 PM;so I don't play it anymore;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:35 PM;oh i read that as i hate FFXIV;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:36 PM;lol;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:36 PM;so you haven't finished ARR?;;

monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:36 PM;wow;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:36 PM;you can pay squenix to skip to stormblood;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:39 PM;do one specific rotation or else you get kicked or flamed or something silly like that lol;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:39 PM;I struggle staying consistent with xiv because it's the same with mmos in general;;
HayleeLOL#0964;20-Sep-17 12:40 PM;I still have yet to play XIV but.. I work full time and already have WoW to scratch my MMO itch;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:40 PM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 it's fine if you're just doing normal content and older raids;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:41 PM;so what's the difference between the types of content;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:41 PM;like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:41 PM;are the super serious raids special;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:41 PM;or is there like a casual goof off version that you can play around with just for fun;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:41 PM;normal = casual version;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;"extreme = serious boss fight, savage = serious raid";;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;beyond savage = extreme hardcore;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;ah so basically just difficulty modes?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;see I thought that;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;ya;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;each one had like their own specific content;;

Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:42 PM;I think all that changes is like;;

monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:43 PM;uhh no;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:43 PM;like its harder;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:43 PM;lol;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:43 PM;normal / extreme / savage only applies to duties;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:43 PM;so like;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:43 PM;the navel (titan) is a duty;;

monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:50 PM;there's no cleric stance;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:50 PM;so you dont have to switch stances when you switch between healing and dps;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 12:50 PM;That's perfect tho;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:50 PM;ya;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:56 PM;I remember one time saving the entire party as an arcanist because everyone ended up dying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-17 12:56 PM;Lol;;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 12:58 PM;I thought Cleric Stance still existed.;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:58 PM;I mean it does;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:58 PM;But instead of being a stance;;
monokomonoe#8934;20-Sep-17 12:58 PM;it's now a timed 5% damage boost;;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 01:01 PM;"Oh. That would be why. I didn't actually see that they had changed it, just saw it on a list.";;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 01:02 PM;"I haven't gotten Stormblood yet (may not, hard to tell if I can keep up with XIV), but I like to try and check in with it now and again.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;20-Sep-17 01:09 PM;I may try the free trial 😄;;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 01:09 PM;For XIV? I'd do it.;;
Treble#5035;20-Sep-17 01:09 PM;It basically lets you try any of the base classes up to lvl 20;;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 01:10 PM;"It's tons of fun, it's just hard to keep up with on my end because poor and low on time. Poor is less of an issue, but I can't make more time pop up.";;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 01:10 PM;"Even watching cutscenes is hard to find time for, and that's much less time investment.";;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 01:34 PM;I'm not paying for an overpriced (in Brazil) mmo that I won't have the time to play;;
Marcello#4574;20-Sep-17 01:36 PM;"I even thought about trying it, but they almost doubled the subscription price";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;20-Sep-17 02:37 PM;you should all play Secret World Legends instead;;
Mirron#9949;20-Sep-17 03:30 PM;Why?;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:09 AM;Thanks guys!;;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;^.^;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"@spoopy#2681  , did you get Shiva in the battle?";;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;No she's gone;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;She's dead?;;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"Ye, I've crossed the point of no return";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"Then you'll have to retry the battle, I am afraid.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"There is one way to insta-kill Anima, but it's with Shiva.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:10 AM;"Yeah, you really do need Shiva for this one.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:11 AM;"But don't worry, it is a tough battle!";;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:11 AM;"Sadly I knew this, but I'd have to go back past the battle with the crawler";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:11 AM;"You have to attack Anima with Shiva and cast Blizzard on Shiva, that should heal her HP.";;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:11 AM;Which is a bugger;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:11 AM;Oh no! That's quite a way;;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:11 AM;Is it impossible without Shiva?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"I don't think so, but very, very, very, VERY hard.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"Not impossible, but hard.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"Also, Anima basically wrecks you.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;Shiva is the best way.;;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;Thanks anyway guys!;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;Good luck!;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:12 AM;"If you use her Overdrive while Anima is using Boost, you absolutely destroy it.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:13 AM;"Oh, and after you destroy Anima, Seymour begins casting Multi-Spells.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:13 AM;That's where all the Nulls come in handy.;;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:14 AM;Noted!;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 11:14 AM;"Shell is useful too, because those spells can be a complete dick. But only if you have a spare turn.";;
spoopy#2681;21-Sep-17 11:14 AM;Should I use Vale during Anima? or save it?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"After you beat Anima, pull back Shiva. Seymour will cast spells in this order, I believe.  Blizzaga, Thundaga, Waterga and Firaga";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:15 AM;"Use Shiva, because she has Blizzard, and if you use Blizzard on herself, she heals herself.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 11:15 AM;Because Shiva must take damage to get the Overdrive going.;;
fine and dandy#9438;21-Sep-17 11:24 AM;Having played x to completion ten years ago i can't help much unfortunately;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:22 PM;"--after Cloud recovers his memories, he does seem a bit more lively.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:23 PM;"Expressing his feelings openly, asking for forgiveness, doing SQUATS";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:23 PM;"Well, also, in general I think that they'd have to show him starting to gain weight and everything.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:23 PM;It'd be great to see that on  a more physical level. Something subtle.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:23 PM;"Since he hadn't eaten anything solid at the least for a few months before Tifa found him,.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"It depends how long FFVII lasts for, too. Like the journey in FFIX takes place over a couple of weeks.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"Yeah, in Advent Children for example he isn't skinny at all.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:24 PM;FFIX takes a few months actually.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:24 PM;But yeah that's fair.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"The wiki has a timeline, let me get it.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"That's probably more accurate, I just know it's not an awfully long time";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:25 PM;http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IX/Timeline;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"I've surmised Aerith lives for a few weeks, two months tops, after Zack dies";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:25 PM;So just over three months! TiL;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;I didn't learn this until recently either tbh!;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"That's kind of sad,when you think about it, for Aerith";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;really sad;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;Something like this for each FF would be useful.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;Oh _there is_;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"But oh well, at least we know that one day, when Cloud dies and goes to the Lifestream, he'll reunite with Aerith.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;For VII at least.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"If you think about it, Tifa finds Cloud, shortly after Zack dies";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"After all, Zack was never actually Aerith's boyfriend.";;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"Man, that's fast.";;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;"Like, FF isn't very good at pacing.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:26 PM;Zack and Aerith forever;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:27 PM;"While she grew to love Cloud for Cloud, she was initially drawn to him because he reminded her of Zack";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:27 PM;But...;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:27 PM;http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII/Timeline;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:27 PM;But original translations.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:27 PM;T-They were never a couple--;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:28 PM;"Not officially, but they were extremely fond of one another in Crisis Core. I believe Aerith says something along the line of having dated someone in SOLDIER at the start of FFVII, but I might be wrong on that.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:28 PM;It's probably not even a _few_ weeks between Zack dying and Tifa finding cloud.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:28 PM;"It's probably a few days, a week tops.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;yeah;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;but a few weeks til Aerith dies;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;LIKE;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;I;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;SAID;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;ORIGINAL TRANSLATION;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:29 PM;I'd say a few months between Zack's death and Aerith's.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;Disc 1 seems to happen over the last three months of 2007;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;"Either way, it's really short, and really sad for Aerith";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;Disc 1 and the first part of disc 2.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;Yeah. Definitely.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;So FFVII is just a couple of months too;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;"Also I think based on this that while IX is paced really quickly, VII is inherently more spread out.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:30 PM;The story takes about ~8 months.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:31 PM;"According to the straight-from-japanese retranslation I'm playing, Aerith only saw Zack as a really close friend who she depended on.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:31 PM;"From when the game starts, to they escape Midgar, how long do you think that lasted?";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:31 PM;I'd say barely a day.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:31 PM;Let me look this over again;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:31 PM;It's a couple of months;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:31 PM;"the bombing mission is in december, end game is in January";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;Tifa's a better waifu than Aerith anyway;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;"At any rate, I need to head to work";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;That's a few days at best yeah;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;"I think Square retconned Aerith and Zack to be a couple, given Crisis Core";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;people like to paint this picture that Aerith as some pure individual but it's not true;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;she has a pure heart;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;They might not have been in FFVII;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;But we don't even know if Crisis Core's events will remain canon after 7 Remake.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;but she's not exactly a pure person;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;Maybe they'll retconn the whole Angeal/Genesis deal to vanish.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;I hope so!;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:32 PM;I think they tried to make it a point that Aerith above all else was a normal person. She was human.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;she literally offered Cloud a date in exchange for protection;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;in Japan that's a step just under prostitution;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;Aerith is a naughty girl;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;"Crisis Core will sto be cannon, at least towards original 7";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;"(I'm not kidding you can actually pay for dates in Japan, they're not prostitutes they're hired dates)";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;Oh dear god.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:33 PM;That makes me cringe.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;I mean that's;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;a thing here too.;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;Escorts.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;not to mention that time she convinced a guy to pay a shitton of money for a single flower;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;"That's what an escort service is, it's just being an escort also has the connotation of some of them doubling as prostitutes.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;Aerith did what she had to to make money in a real shitty slum.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;and her generally overly flirty nature with everyone;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;Ultimately she was a good person brought to desperation.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;"What I do love about that scene is that Cloud doesn't even say anything, he just accepts it.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:34 PM;Tbh I grew up with people that turned out like Aerith.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;Cloud wanted that Flower Girl butt.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;"Tifa, however, is that chill friend that always sticks by your side no matter what";;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;😦;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;but would also gladly be much more with you if offered;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;Even if your spiky-head friend is cockblocking you with a dead girl.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;Tifa was better when she was in the friend zone;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;I will forever say that.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;noe;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:35 PM;her reaction when she realized everyone was watching is priceless;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;when was that?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;I can't recall.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;towards the end of VII;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;"I like Aerith more, but not a big concern on who Cloud dates really.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;End game when they get it on;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;before the final battle;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;"Oh, in the Highwind";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;"she fuckin' falls to the ground, , idk why people portray her as overly assertive and outgoing, she's actually pretty shy all throughout";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:36 PM;Yeah.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;"I mean, with tits like that-";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;Aerith is the confident one;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;despite looking as if she would be the shy one;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;Do you think Tifa chooses to dress like that?;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;"With, yanno.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;my assumption is that Tifa's clothes are the most comfortable for;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;you know;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;fighting;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;The excuse is that it's for her martial arts;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;And it's most likely what she wears to tend bar;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:37 PM;"She was hired for her looks, after all";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:38 PM;...It's literally her own bar;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:38 PM;Lol.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:38 PM;There's a piece of dialogue in Crisis Core about Seventh Heaven;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:38 PM;"a guy wants to open a bar, you can suggest that name, and he wants to have it ran by a girl with long legs";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;"if she were actually what the fandom portrayed her as she would probably use her looks to convince men to pay more for drinks, , but like I said";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;too shy for that;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;Speaking of looks.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;I really can't get over Cloud and Tifa's clothes in Advent Children.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;Just.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;Ugh.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:39 PM;I like Tifa's.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;I really don't like any of the two.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;I also like Yuffie's.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Everyone else is typical.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Yuffie's aight.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;"Isn't Cid jacketless, though?";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;"I'm pretty sure that in VII, he wears some kinda brown jacket.";;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;I'm not a big fan of any of them.;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;Honestly most of the time I think sequels mess up character outfits.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;But Cloud's outfit just barely makes sense.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:40 PM;He has a sweater tied around his waist;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:41 PM;"In AC, in his retirement, he became an old man";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:41 PM;"Wrist glove, arm long glove...";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:41 PM;A really lousy arm cover.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:41 PM;Cloud's was ***EDGY*** to reflect his new personality.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:41 PM;It better feel good to wear that otherwise it's annoying as balls.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Yuffie's weird arm cast never made sense to me.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;I always thought her arm was broken or something.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Same!;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;I think the concept is that it's meant as a targe of some kind;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;shield thingy;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Like Rikku wears?;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Yes.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Likely protects her from cutting herself on her fuma-shuriken.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;Oh good point!;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:42 PM;It's a little... clunky;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:43 PM;She still has an arm guard in AC and DOC;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:43 PM;It's just not;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:43 PM;BARRETT'S HAIR THOUGH;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:43 PM;ridiculously 90's and only covers the part of her arm that the blade might touch;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:45 PM;It's kind of counter-intuitive for her other hand not to be gloved though;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:45 PM;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/5/50/YuffieCG.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120831181949;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:45 PM;But you can see what I mean here.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:45 PM;It looks a lot better there!;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:45 PM;Ye;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:46 PM;IDK if I prefer her DoC or AC design;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:46 PM;DoC is more colorful and I think that fits Yuffie.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 02:46 PM;Her AC design is cute though;;

Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:47 PM;He got modernized based on what styles actually WERE in 200u;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;200u;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;Oh yeah.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;... 2007;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;ech.;;

BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;Let's go Incognito.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;His viir look is sorta;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:48 PM;And then she wears skimpy-ass clothing.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:49 PM;Similar to the ac knd;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:49 PM;One*;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:49 PM;Tbh the gunner look really isn't all that skimpy but if you pay attention it's Rikku's fault;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:49 PM;"Rikku, more like";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:49 PM;Bimbo;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:49 PM;haHAAAAAAAAAA;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;Yuna based her carefree attitude off of Rikku;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;Eh 🤷;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;I feel like Yuna was fine in X-2.;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;Rikku... not so much. Yuna clearly was putting on an act.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;I keep laughing at Paine's battle stance.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;Just looking over her shoulder.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:50 PM;That neck must hurt.;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:51 PM;FF is not the series for correct posture in general.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:52 PM;"Yeah, I suppose.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:52 PM;"I also like to think that, when the ATB charges for an item, they're like";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 02:52 PM;"Shit, where did I put it--";;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:53 PM;That;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:53 PM;That's probably what it is. Or just a balance thing.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:56 PM;I think Rikku was fine in parts but bad in others;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:57 PM;But I think both girls were back to form once they fought Bahamut;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:57 PM;Except for;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 02:57 PM;The calm lands chapter 4 mission;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 02:59 PM;I don't recall that one.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:00 PM;The whodunnit about the machina rampage;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:01 PM;One of the 2 100% completion options is that Rikku broke the machina accidentally;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:01 PM;The other is that Rin himself sabotaged it;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 03:02 PM;"Oh. Yeah, I remember that. That was the Mi'hen High Road though.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:02 PM;Oh! Yeah. My bad.;;
Mirron#9949;21-Sep-17 03:02 PM;I liked the Scooby Doo reference.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:03 PM;I like how the baby chocobo eater manages to be adorable by just being a downsized version of the actual eater's model;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:04 PM;Provided X-3 happens one of the things I'm most interested in is actually how they portray Rikku. Because how she acts in the first two chapters of X-2 don't work.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:05 PM;Given that Spira has spiraled back to bad and Yuna is trying to defeat Sin again she'd have to be a more mature version of her X persona.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:06 PM;"And seeing as how Yuna went back to how she acted in x after she beckoned Tidus, both of which seem like they exist to return to the status quo, that seems likely.";;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 03:07 PM;"There's that image of Yuna with long hair for Will too, isn't there? She looks super pretty there.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:11 PM;"Yeah, it's basically her X-2 hair without the braid I think.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:12 PM;There's also Tidus' with a Jecht Bandanna.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 03:12 PM;Yes! He looks pretty cool with it.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:13 PM;I also like Chuami's design;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:13 PM;Kurgum is lacking;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 03:14 PM;He just seems be a generic... kid? It's hard to tell his age;;

Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:14 PM;"They're supposed to be like the same age, and Chuami is 17";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:14 PM;He looks 12;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 03:15 PM;"I think it's because he's positioned at a weird angle from Chuami, making her look a lot taller and older than him";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:15 PM;Yeah I can see that;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:15 PM;Also it doesn't help that generally Chuami's design is more interesting.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:15 PM;With the braids in her hair.;;
Aruu#2066;21-Sep-17 03:16 PM;Her design is pretty cute.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:17 PM;"It might be the hair but she looked kind of similar to someone from Type-0, sorta.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:17 PM;Not sure which.;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:17 PM;"Still I'd like to see her with an in-game model, it'd probably look cool. Even Kurgum's hooded design might look better.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 03:17 PM;"It sort of lends itself to a Black Mage which is presumably one of the party roles that would be open given that Lulu is the mayor of Besaid, and a mom.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 04:23 PM;I kinda like Tidus' design.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;21-Sep-17 04:23 PM;"When you think about it, his X outfit was just a sport outfit.";;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 04:24 PM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;21-Sep-17 04:24 PM;I'm interested to see what his real clothing style is lmao;;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 02:22 PM;"Speaking of FFVII, the part in the ShinRa HQ with the blood trails scared me so much when I first played through it.";;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;It was pretty spoopy indeed;;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;But come on;;
xPendulum#0001;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;for me it was sephiroth in the temple of the ancients;;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;The mansion with the heartbeat was even more;;
xPendulum#0001;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;oh yes the mansion creeped me out;;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;Seeing the impaled Zolom was pretty terrifying too;;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 02:23 PM;It looked like some zombie outbreak;;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 02:24 PM;Even zombie-like enemies started spawning there;;
xPendulum#0001;22-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"also aeris's theme is so sad, the jenova-life fight (which I couldn't lose because water ring) was so...it didn't really feel like a battle haha";;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"I like to think that was intentional. It's not a hard fight, and the (recent) water ring makes it even easier";;
xPendulum#0001;22-Sep-17 02:24 PM;"yeah, no victory pose after it either";;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"Plus, it's hard to fight through all the tears.";;
Marcello#4574;22-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"Just one thing, I'd recommend calling her Aerith instead, some people will not take it lightly lol";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Sep-17 02:25 PM;"What always gets me, is the true Nibelheim incident. Especially with this iconic scene: https://orig00.deviantart.net/bd94/f/2014/080/d/2/sephy_inflamed_by_roguevincent-d7b25ok.gif";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Sep-17 02:49 PM;I guess it's a missable that I've always missed;;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 02:49 PM;"It is so easily missed, since you'll have tons of money at that point in the game. You have to literally spend everything for Zidane to say it.";;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 02:50 PM;It's when Zidane is trying to help the Regent Cid with the potions;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Sep-17 02:50 PM;oh;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Sep-17 02:50 PM;Yeah I just get the potions and move on with the plot;;

HayleeLOL#0964;22-Sep-17 03:00 PM;I didn't think Bundt cake was real til I saw one in a cookbook a few years back;;
HayleeLOL#0964;22-Sep-17 03:00 PM;first thought: OH IT'S THE FF9 CAKE;;
Aruu#2066;22-Sep-17 03:01 PM;"See, video games are educational! The more you know! 🌈";;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:01 PM;So.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:01 PM;Them FF6 discussions tho.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:01 PM;@Marcello#4574 Most of their interaction was backstory.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:01 PM;Pretty neat.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:01 PM;It didn't need to be shown unless what you wanted was flashbacks.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:02 PM;"And the only flashbacks we got in 6 iirc were of Terra, her parents, Locke, Rachel, Setzer, and Darrill.";;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 04:02 PM;That's why it felt weird;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 04:02 PM;Celes is basically a Cid creation;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 04:02 PM;And suddenly they have this grandfather relationship;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;"God, the first time I saw the Blackjack rise outta the water immediately after that flashback.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;Legit got chills.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;You know we probably SHOULD have seen the flashbacks with that when I think about it.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;"This fucking game, man.";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;"Because what can be inferred is that unlike other people in the empire Cid treated Celes like an actual person, a real child, and was a paternal figure to her.";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;But we don't see that until Triangle Island.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:03 PM;Or whatever it's called.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:04 PM;I don't even really get attached to game characters that much.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:05 PM;But every other minute in FF6 I cared more and more about the characters.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:07 PM;Same tho;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:07 PM;I mean I get attached but;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:07 PM;FF6 was something different with even the largest cast of characters in the franchise.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:08 PM;at least permanent / main party members;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:08 PM;I don't remember if 2 had more or not.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:08 PM;I agonized over choosing​ my party.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:08 PM;"Like, I gotta have Celes.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:08 PM;And Terra's cool.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:09 PM;But if I have Celes I gotta have Locke.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:09 PM;"And Sabin is awesome, so I gotta have him.";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:09 PM;my main party ended up being like.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:09 PM;Terra/Celes/Locke/Sabin;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:09 PM;The final dungeon being three teams helps.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:09 PM;But do I just leave his twin brother alone on the ship?;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:10 PM;And then Mog was great and played super well.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:10 PM;And Gau was fun.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:11 PM;"That's honestly my biggest complaint, it was stressful trying to pick my party because they were all so great.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:11 PM;"I mean, what a complaint to have!";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:11 PM;It's too good!;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:12 PM;Lmao;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 04:12 PM;I mean I'll be honest at least Umaro and Gogo didn't make it harder for me.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;23-Sep-17 04:14 PM;"Those are the hiddens, yeah?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 04:35 PM;Kinda sad that 7 was the last FF to have optional party members.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 04:36 PM;It'll be cool if we could have more guests and/or optional/hidden party members;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-17 05:01 PM;"Hell yeah, more party members to ignore for the rest of the game.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-17 05:44 PM;You mean more optional party members who are actually badass;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;23-Sep-17 06:01 PM;"`And the only flashbacks we got in 6 iirc were of Terra, her parents, Locke, Rachel, Setzer, and Darrill.`, , you forgot all of Shadow's dreams";;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 06:20 PM;I did yeah;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 06:20 PM;Ty;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 06:41 PM;As far as the franchise as a whole TAY has VI beat handily.;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 06:44 PM;I meant main series but yeah true;;
monokomonoe#8934;23-Sep-17 11:26 PM;TAY was pretty cool;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:27 PM;It's kind of cute. I like having so many characters.;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:27 PM;"But at the same time it's just... too many, you know? Like you can't hope to use a good amount of them. And some of them really suffer. Like Harley.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-17 11:30 PM;Calca and Brina were missed opportunities;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-17 11:31 PM;I liked the idea of having pseudo blue mages but the rng aspect fucked it up;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-17 11:31 PM;especially for calca;;
Treble#5035;23-Sep-17 11:33 PM;My only issue with tay is reusing dungeons so heavily;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:35 PM;Harley was also supposed to be a Blue Mage I believe.;;
Mirron#9949;23-Sep-17 11:35 PM;Dummied out info on it was found in the files if I recall right. Which would have helped her a ton.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;24-Sep-17 12:02 AM;"speaking of TAY, can I just be the one to point out, Older Porom looks nothing like she did as a child, unless that hair is dyed";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:03 AM;It's either dyed or it magically changed colors;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:04 AM;I think it's the latter;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:04 AM;Palom has that white streak;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;24-Sep-17 12:08 AM;also I'm still angery that they didn't quite confirm the Rydia-Edge ship;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;24-Sep-17 12:09 AM;like they came sooooo close;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:18 AM;I think it could be either with Porom. I think it was to better differentiate her from Palom.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:18 AM;"If she died it she probably really wanted to stand out from him, which makes sense. They grew apart.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:24 AM;"Yeah, it's mainly that Palom has a streak in his hair that makes me thing it's magic.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:24 AM;Also - can I just say that Porom has my favorite version of the basic white mage design in that game?;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:26 AM;"It doesn't really look too much like a white mage as in the white and red bit, but it is a nice design. As far as very solidly White Mages it's probably one of my favorites along with Minwu's.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:26 AM;"Lol, that reminded me of when my friend drew Minwu in Rosa's outfit for some odd reason.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:37 AM;It's a classic white mage design if you think of pink as an offset of red at least.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:37 AM;But yeah you got what I meant lol.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:37 AM;"That sounds hilarious, also.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:42 AM;I'll try to find it.;;

Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:49 AM;Found where I reblogged it at least.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:53 AM;👍;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:53 AM;Hottt xD;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:54 AM;"Lol. It was a joke, but I think it went somewhere good. 😛 Never would have though Minwu as Rosa would look nice.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:55 AM;It looks good because it isn't a 1:1 design swap.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 12:55 AM;"And as such, the abs make it.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:00 AM;Yeah. Sadly I don't think we will see swimsuit and cape Minwu in Dissidia as a costume.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:01 AM;Would finally be someone to rival Kuja for scantily clad as a male.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:02 AM;Kuja still takes the cake because >codpiece;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:02 AM;And I wouldn't be surprised if underneath that bottom half of his costume was a jock or thong.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:03 AM;"Hence a rival. 😛 Though Minwu is uh... showing a bit more than I'd expect for his outfit, even if it isn't quite a codpiece.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:04 AM;Look;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:04 AM;if Tifa gets jiggle physics Minwu can have a bulge.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:08 AM;"I am okay with this. I also like that apparently Kuja is supposed to jiggle too. Or at least they made a joke about it, can't recall if it happened.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:09 AM;"Like, equal opportunity at least is nice.";;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:12 AM;The one that should have jiggle physics is Jecht.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:12 AM;He's the one with tiddies.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:15 AM;It wasn't that area that was going to jiggle for Kuja.;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:16 AM;_Fair._;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:17 AM;xD;;
Treble#5035;24-Sep-17 01:18 AM;Reading about Kuja's design he's probably wearing a jock;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 01:26 AM;"Maybe. It's still surprising. Shame too, he's one of my favorite villains. But I couldn't hope to cosplay as him.";;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 08:59 AM;"Speaking about Zidane and Trance, I wonder if his status as a Genome means he achieved it more easily? Someone once pointed out that the names of his skills under Trance could be linked to the fact he was supposed to be in Kuja's role.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:24 AM;What about his Dyne skill names? Kind of curious about that. And his having access to Trance is why he's meant to replace Kuja. Kuja was designed without that potential supposedly.;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 09:26 AM;Well his ultimate one is called 'Grand Leathal' which sounds *intense* for someone like Zidane. Solution 9 sounds like some kind of biological attack.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:27 AM;Ah.;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 09:30 AM;"Everyone else has something that vaguely links to their class; Vivi and Eiko get doublecast, Steiner is three times as strong, Garnet's summons stay with her, Freya keeps jumping, Quina can eat things without having to weaken them as much, Amarant gets to use his skills for the whole party as monk. Zidane's Trance isn't linked to stealing.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 09:36 AM;"True, I think Dyne is tied to his role. Though he has kind of a mishmash of skills in his default mode.";;
Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:39 AM;I think Dyna is more related to his lore than his job 🤔;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 10:40 AM;Precisely! While everyone else has it as a part of their 'job';;
Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:40 AM;Dyne**;;
Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:40 AM;Wished we couldve seen how strong zidane is;;

Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:41 AM;"not implies, the lore states it";;
Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:41 AM;lol;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 10:41 AM;"Even stronger, potentially! Zidane still wins against him, and that's while growing up on Gaia";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 10:49 AM;"Yeah, but Kuja really isn't all that strong when working as intended.";;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 10:52 AM;plus he was coming close to stopping;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 10:55 AM;"Well there is that factor too. But Zidane and co beat Kuja pretty easily. He was probably holding back (think it was a cute FFII reference), but still wasn't like Kuja showed all that much power.";;
Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:55 AM;"I think Kuja went all out, he destroyed all of Terra";;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 10:56 AM;"Yeah, that was him at his most powerful.";;

Bazo#5158;24-Sep-17 10:57 AM;Wish we couldve seen something like this;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 11:00 AM;That was Kuja in Trance. Not only an artificial Trance but one bolstered by tons of souls.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 11:00 AM;I'm talking about the fight where Kuja tried to achieve Trance. But his Trance mode isn't part of his specs.;;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 11:04 AM;"Plus if it was it kind of raises odd questions about Mikoto and Zidane. Kuja could blow up a planet, at that point seems easy to cycle all the souls out of Gaia.";;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 11:10 AM;Oh that looks incredibly cool!;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 11:14 AM;"well Kuja didn't have the same experience that Zidane did, he never got to grow up, he was made as an adult male.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 11:47 AM;Yeah. That's what I meant. He was designed to never reach Trance. Kuja's Trance form isn't part of Zidane's exceeding Kuja bit. It would also make Garland quite the idiot.;;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 11:50 AM;"Though Kuja had the potential, even if it was artificial. That's pretty interesting.";;
Mirron#9949;24-Sep-17 12:04 PM;"It was more he absorbed souls that had the potential for Trance, and he just stacked all that potential.";;
Aruu#2066;24-Sep-17 12:07 PM;That's also interesting! Crafty Kuja;;

Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:12 PM;I thought Serah said something about kids learning how to use magic almost as soon as they started setting up New Bodhum.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:13 PM;And I feel like the former l'Cie would be among the first to become magically inclined.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:13 PM;"We know that Sazh, Hope, and Serah do but it's not said when. It just sorta makes sense to me.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Oct-17 02:14 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:17 PM;"Well, I think you get more than just magic powers.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:18 PM;I mean if nothing else the Eidolon.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:18 PM;And I always got the impression they were just in general supernaturally better.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:18 PM;Did Snow have Shiva in his dlc? I never got a chance to play it.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:19 PM;I imagine you'd need to undergo _another_ crisis of faith to reconnect with your eidolon.;;
fine and dandy#9438;01-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Eidolon s are pretty cool;;
fine and dandy#9438;01-Oct-17 02:20 PM;I like hopes especially;;
fine and dandy#9438;01-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Hope in general is pretty dank;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:23 PM;Hope is awesome.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:23 PM;Best white mage of the series.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:23 PM;And I have no idea on if Snow got Shiva or not.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:24 PM;I'm curious as to why Hope is defined as a white mage by some people when the devs meant him to be a black mage.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:24 PM;You can basically tell what each character's role was meant to be by were their ultimate skill was located.;;
fine and dandy#9438;01-Oct-17 02:25 PM;Vanille is fragile as hell;;
fine and dandy#9438;01-Oct-17 02:25 PM;"Also hope has synergist, medic, and ravager";;
fine and dandy#9438;01-Oct-17 02:25 PM;Which is an absolutely insane mage combo;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:26 PM;"Hope and Vanille seem like the two designated magic users of the group. Snow/Fang being the physical, Sazh/Lightning the hybrids.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:27 PM;"Hope and Vanille both have Medic and Ravager. The difference is the third paradigm, Synergist for Hope, Saboteur for Vanille.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:27 PM;"Synergist I associate with White Magic, Saboteur with Black Magic. Because buffs and debuffs.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:28 PM;"I mean, Vanille's ultimate move is Death. Hope's is basically Holy. So I mean... to me that also kind of says something.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:29 PM;It's kind of interesting where they're placed though.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:29 PM;Since Last Resort is in Ravager and Death is in... saboteur? Iirc?;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:29 PM;It's just strange placement overall if that was the intent.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:30 PM;It was in Saboteur. And I mean... Death is White Magic? Not really.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:31 PM;Hope having Last Resort in Ravager isn't really all that different from Holy being in the offensive magic category in VI anyways.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:32 PM;"I think it likely has something to do with the way that they were meshing roles, because to be fair Hope's low hp is more classically a white mage thing also.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:32 PM;Compared to black mages anyhow.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:32 PM;Or do I have that backwards?;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:35 PM;"I think Hope and Vanille both have fairly low HP, not sure really beyond that.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:38 PM;Looking at his gameplay I think I would compare Hope to a Sage.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:38 PM;ala Tellah.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:39 PM;He's the only character who learns all elemental magic and apparently learns all Medic spells outside of Vanille's special;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:39 PM;Vanille's special?;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:39 PM;"And I mean, both Hope and Vanille are Sages I would argue, yeah.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:39 PM;Crud I forgot it's in Sab;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:39 PM;... who has the special in medic then...;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:40 PM;No one has a special in Medic.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:40 PM;The specials are in the three offensive roles.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:40 PM;"Commando, Ravager, and Saboteur.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:40 PM;That seems wasteful but 🤷;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"They're meant to be offensive specialties, mostly they're related to the Stagger gauge though.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:41 PM;Like Ravagers in general fill up the Stagger gauge to max.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:44 PM;"But yeah, that's my reasoning on Hope vs Vanille. Ravager + Medic are there for both of them, so then looking at the different roles they have. Plus Hope's Last Resort feels like Holy, and Death... really doesn't feel like a White Mage thing.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:44 PM;"Plus I just want another male White Mage. It's one of my favorite jobs darn it, and we only have Minwu.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:46 PM;I think the only thing that really differentiates Vanille and Hope is their core stat;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:46 PM;they're both 'sages' so to speak;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:47 PM;But Vanille focuses more on HP and Hope focuses on the magic stat.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:48 PM;I would agree they're Sages broadly. Only pointing out if they have to be White Mage/Black Mage why I split them like that.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:48 PM;"Though generally Sages have like, a specialty. Like I think of Aerith as a Sage, but obviously White Magic focused.";;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:49 PM;Hope basically learns everything in both MED and RAV outside of the -strike skills.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:49 PM;Which makes sense because he's a range fighter.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:49 PM;The lack of -strike skills is also part of why I consider Hope/Vanille the mages too.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:50 PM;Yeah absolutely.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:50 PM;"From what I could tell reading their gameplay pages if you had to split the six of them up Snow and Fang are tanks, Vanille and Hope are a mix of DPS and heals, and then Fang and Sazh are sort of... all of it.";;
WAN#6104;01-Oct-17 02:51 PM;you mean Lightning and Sazh here?;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:51 PM;Fang is so good she is in two areas apparently. 😛;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:51 PM;"I like Lightning myself, but sadly she doesn't count I guess.";;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:52 PM;I tease. But yeah.;;
Treble#5035;01-Oct-17 02:52 PM;... Yeah sorry lmao;;

Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:52 PM;Lightning I tend to think of as a Red Mage.;;
Mirron#9949;01-Oct-17 02:52 PM;"Because she's got a speed focus, and her three roles.";;

fine and dandy#9438;12-Oct-17 12:46 PM;What slur?;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 12:46 PM;"It was deleted, so.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 12:46 PM;I'll DM you lmao;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Oct-17 12:46 PM;Kk;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Oct-17 12:48 PM;Oh;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 01:10 PM;"We're fairly lenient when it comes to bad language, but slurs like that aren't acceptable. Additionally if someone asks you politely to stop, the best thing to do is apologise and delete the offending message.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 01:15 PM;"I, personally, don't like people calling me certain slurs related to a certain show I enjoy";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 01:15 PM;I'll just leave it at that;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:03 PM;"As much as I'd want Lulu to be the badass mom I think she and Wakka will be retired, maybe along with Kimahri, in X-3.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:03 PM;Since they're all village leaders.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:03 PM;"Yeah, that's the thing, when you get upgraded to a parent, especially a mother, you often get taken out of the fights.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:04 PM;I don't think the mother thing particularly excludes her as much as being the mayor of Besaid does tbh;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:04 PM;Like was just mentioned in General even Rosa got to be a party member in TAY.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:05 PM;Yeah! I forgot about Rosa.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:06 PM;Them being the remaining older characters makes sense with retiring them also.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:06 PM;Kimahri is also the one without a built in replacement;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:07 PM;"Good point, plus Kimahri being from a warrior race kind of implies that he's fighting until he physically can't any more";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:08 PM;"Yeah, the only thing I can think of that would keep him out of the fight would be that he's supposed to be the elder... at the same time I don't know how in character it would be for him not to involve himself.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:08 PM;"He is, after all, Yuna's second dad.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:09 PM;Exactly. Her blue furry dad.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:10 PM;"Still - Paine replaces Auron, Chuami replaces Wakka, Kurgum replaces Lulu. It's practically built in added to the rest of the FFX cast. I'd be down for it.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:11 PM;"Chuami could arguably replace Tidus, given what we know.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:12 PM;True! I mainly said Wakka because there's a lack of a ranged fighter otherwise.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:12 PM;making Tidus a more Auron figure perhaps?;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:12 PM;Unless Yuna turns into the summoner from the FF anime.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:12 PM;"Which, to be fair, would be awesome.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:13 PM;"Well Yuna does know how to fight without her summons now! That's a good point though, Yuna could take on any role.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:14 PM;She's fallen back into her FFX persona because of ***SECRETS*** but she was pretty damn good with those guns.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:14 PM;"So... gun summons, haha.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:14 PM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WfLEWe9-8;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:15 PM;oh my gosh I forgot all about this anime;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:17 PM;"I never finished it! Honestly, I feel like I need to.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:17 PM;Also - do you think we could see Jecht as an Aeon? Since the other summons are also probably Final Aeon's.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:17 PM;"It's possible, given that he was a Final Aeon of sorts, wasn't he?";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:18 PM;He was!;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:18 PM;He was the Fayth for Braska's Final Aeon after all;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:18 PM;"Speaking of Rosa, part of her joining the party in TAY, was due to her wanting to keep her son safe.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:19 PM;"Yeah! Maybe not Jecht by name, because who knows if Aeons keep their names.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:19 PM;But I sorta doubt that Seymour's mom was named Anima.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:19 PM;It doesn't seem in line with the other names we see throughout spira.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:19 PM;"Assuming a similar motivation for Lulu, Clea would have be pre-teen at least, if we were to see that happen";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;I thought it was Vidna? Or Vinda?;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Maybe;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Vidina;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Time to consult the wiki;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;That's the one!;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Al Bhed for Future;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;It's Al Bhed for - yeah;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;I think it was meant to signify Wakka's character growth;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;I do like Wakka for how his attitude changed.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:20 PM;Wakka has growth?;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:21 PM;He goes from 'asshole racist' to 'chill dad';;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:21 PM;"Of course he does!  I mean he goes from flat out hating the Al Bhed to accepting Rikku as a close friend. He's even genuinely down when Home is destroyed, though he tries to comfort Rikku in the worst possible way";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;Oh god;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;Happy festival fireworks.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;WHYYYY.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;I think everyone in FFX has their own character arc - even some of the NPCs.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;they do!;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;Like Dona has some of the BEST character development for a nonessential character.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;"All she cared about when we met her was becoming the High Summoner, and then by the time we're in air she's like do you think it'd be okay to quit?";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;Yes! I love that part.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:22 PM;And in X-2 she's more or less the leader of Kilika Port.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;Her VA nails how vulnerable she's feeling.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;Also it was HER Valefor that comforts Tidus when he finds out the truth about the pilgrimage.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;I don't think that was an accident.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;I did not notice that! What a lovely touch.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;Wait yeah!;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;I love that scene so much.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:23 PM;"Kid me honestly saw none of it coming, too!";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:24 PM;"I was shook, as the kids say. I had no idea at all. .";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:24 PM;"I love X so much haha, there's a reason that it's a level head above a bunch of the other games. It does so well with so many points.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:24 PM;I really want to play X now.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:24 PM;Then play it;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:24 PM;I'm at Guadosalam on my Steam save;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:24 PM;"I always felt that Dona, as antagonistic as she could be towards Yuna, did have a point; she did get special treatment because of her father.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;^ YES.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;No shit;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;"That's one thing I didn't like about Yuna - and it sucks because I love Yuna as a character, I just don't like how everyone gushed over her for it. 😂";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;She had a point about Yuna inherently having celebrity status but I think she was too extreme on her for having so many guardians.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;I'm pretty sure that all Summoners were treated like nobility;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;Oh aye.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:25 PM;Yuna was just treated like royalty instead;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;Dona was also sort of a hypocrite but that adds to depth.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;"Because one her main criticisms of Yuna was trying to walk her fathers' path, even having Auron as a guardian.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;I think Dona felt that Yuna was showing off by having so many guardians;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;"But Dona was doing _the same exact thing_ with Yunalesca and Zaon, having only Barthello as her guardian.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;Which she wasn't - she just had a lot of people she could trust in.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;And yeah!;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;"Funny, that.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;That's probably why she was Yuna's rival.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:26 PM;They were doing a lot of the same things.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;"Whereas Isaaru was more of a friendly rival, even in the Via Purifico.";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;"In regards to Auron, I think Dona thought it cheating, having a Guardian who knew the way intimately.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;"When Seymour said Yuna, take me as your pillar of strength, as Yunalesca had her Lord Zaon 🤢";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;Isaaru was among Yuna's many idolisators;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;And Belgemine was first and foremost a teacher.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;"Yuna had _three_ Guardians that more or less knew the way intimately, it's just that Lulu and Wakka never made it to Zanarkand.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:27 PM;You could argue that Seymour's worship of Yuna was all just a ploy to get to her;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;which it probably was;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;Belgemine was fantastic.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;I think it was. He was more concerned about the status she would bring him.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;I think it's more than just that.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;"Yes, but neither Lulu nor Wakka were famous.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;But that's part of it.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;I also think that Seymour was obsessed with Yuna because he had an oedipus complex.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;"if Lulu and Wakka were on a pilgrimage twice before, why does Lulu only have level 1 spells and Wakka the most basic of basic blitzballs when you started X? 🤔";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;Went back to basics.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;Lulu fell out of practise and Wakka gambles.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:28 PM;Settled in to village life;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;And in Wakka's case;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;"He lost his mother at a young age when she became his Fayth, becomes obsessed with her and only ever uses her when he summons.";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;Gotta use the official blitzball for the game;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;Or Wakka kept punting his Blitzballs out to sea;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;"Then Yuna comes along and she looks like his mom, sounds like her, acts like her.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;There's a reason that it had to be _Yuna_;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;"Oooh, the mother angle is an interesting one";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;Or you know..;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:29 PM;That's a good way of putting it.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;"He was a devious bastard, who saw a girl that seemed easy to manipulate";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;"Could also be that she's the daughter of a high summoner, and a summoner herself";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;...yeah.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;I think it was combination of all factors.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;Seymour is a classic manipulator tbh;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;"She might've been, if it wasn't for the good influence of her massive guardian troupe";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:30 PM;"But I think that the mother thing is a pretty big factor that a lot of people don't consider. Their models are mapped as similarly as Tidus and Chappu's, and there's a reason they use Hedy.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:31 PM;I never knew they shared a VA;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:31 PM;They do indeed.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:31 PM;Bloody hell. I want to show my boyfriend FFX now rather than VII 😂;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:31 PM;Seeing him for a week in December and we're going to marathon VII but now I'm tempted to do X;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;"Eh, I don't think Yuna would have been manipulatable even without all of her guardians. That was sort of a point to Seymour at first. She decided ON HER OWN to kill Seymour after all.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;I'd do X if it's his first!;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;Nah see;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;"He's played X in the past, not VII yet though";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;A lot of Yuna's strength came from the support of those around her;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;^;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:32 PM;"She outright says it a lot of the time, too";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;"Yuna may have wanted to or planned to end Seymour, but would she really have been able to without her guardians?";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;Probably not.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;"If it had -just- been Kimahri, Lulu, and Wakka, she'd have been more gullible, especially since Wakka had no suspicions towards Yevon at all.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;I think Lulu had her doubts about Seymour;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;She would have been _more_ gullible but I think she still would have come to certain decisions on her own.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;Lulu definitely did.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;"Might've been suspicious of Seymour himself, but I doubt that Wakka would've had the balls to confront a Maester";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:33 PM;I think Tidus sort of sparked a skepticism in Yuna;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;Him and Auron;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;Kimahri never seemed to like the guy;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;like he asks her all kinds of questions about Yevon;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;and her answer at one point is like I never thought about it;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;"Auron talks a lot about their story, but he still meddles a bit.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;"A lot of Yuna's strength is a quiet resolve, so it might not be quite right that it's just through her Guardians that she got this way. I think she had it in her all along. I think Tidus more sparked rebellion than skepticism.";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:34 PM;In particular when it comes Yevon post-Ixion.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:35 PM;"Because even after Seymour, even after being excommunicated, it's not until Yunalesca that Yuna's like you know what FUCK this religion";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:35 PM;"I'm not saying that it wasn't in her all along, but even if it was, I'm pretty sure that Seymour would have succeeded without said influence";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:35 PM;Rikku is another decent anti-Yevon influence on her;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;"Connecting with her mother's side of the family, her Al Bhed blood";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;Yeah.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;"Yeah, Yuna really looks up to Rikku";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;Actually having someone to live for all of a sudden;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;You have to wonder how she used to feel being around Wakka for most of her life and knowing she was half al-bhed.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;Instead of feeling lonely after her father's sacrifice;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:36 PM;"That might speak to Yuna's character, loving Wakka as much as she does even though she knows he'd hate her if he knew the truth.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;That is actually quite sweet.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;Yuna is a sweetheart through and through;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;"She is.  She can be a little bland at times, but ultimately she's such a nice person. I don't think she has a mean bone in her.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;She's bland on purpose.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;That's why I love X-2 Yuna so much.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;Oh-.. POOPY!;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;Because this is a Yuna that isn't trying to limit herself anymore.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:37 PM;I love X-2 Yuna;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:38 PM;She's taking Tidus and Rikku's influences and using them to find herself.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:38 PM;I hate your plan. It sucks.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:38 PM;I rather enjoy Rikku completely denying her (bad) influence.;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:38 PM;"I do appreciate how Yuna does take influence from them both, but I hope she eventually finds a happy medium within herself.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:39 PM;I think she found her medium by the time the Vegnagun threat was in full swing.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:39 PM;"I can relate in a way to that, so I like Yuna for that one.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:39 PM;Taking influence from others to find oneself.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:39 PM;"Before chapter 3 Yuna is all about sphere hunting, all about just goofing off and being... well, Rikku.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:39 PM;"And then the fiends start to emerge from the chamber's of the fayth and it's Yuna's first instinct to help, convincing even Brother to help out.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:39 PM;"... for money, but that's because >Brother";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:40 PM;"It's lampshaded a lot throughout X-2 that Yuna is self sacrificing, quick to act, etc.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:40 PM;"LeBlanc says it, Nooj says it, Baralai says it, Gippal says it, Paine says it, Rikku says it, Lulu and Wakka say it.";;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:40 PM;"Also, X Yuna is all about the self-sacrifice to make others happy, she still is so in X-2 but nowhere near to the extent she is in X";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;She's a goody goody;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"Playing the Farplane scene right now and she just says I must do what everyone wants, not what I want";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"Like when Tidus goes on and on about their time together post-journey, and she just takes it with a smile.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;X-2 Yuna is more outspoken and a little more selfish but at her core she's the same person.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"Pretty standard teenage thing.. Although Yuna does it through her late-teens, which is usually where personality quirks have already been established and then evolve.";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"Yuna never had a normal childhood though, what with her training to become a summoner";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"Well childhood, teens and onwards I'd say";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:42 PM;She's 19 years old and going through her rebellious phase for the first time tbh;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:42 PM;It's the first time that she doesn't have eyes entirely on her.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:42 PM;"Which is funny, since she's the most famous living celebrity in Spira.";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:44 PM;"She's the most famous living celebrity in all of Spira! And now we await her next evolution with bated breath, tune in to Yuna: The Eternal Calm and Me tonight on Rin-SV";;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:44 PM;She'll be on the front of tacky gossip magazines. 'Yuna's long lost love comes back from the dead.. but you'll NEVER guess what happens next';;

Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:45 PM;Did she whistle? Did HE whistle back? Read on for more!;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;I'm expecting Rin and Shinra to have a giant-ass media conglomerate in X-3;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;Oh man hahaha;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;they had the CommSpheres;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;Just constantly writing fluff-pieces on Yuna;;
HayleeLOL#0964;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;they could have some sort of odd You've Been Framed but for Spira;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;Rin and Shinra's thing is finding and inventing new tech I think.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:46 PM;Rikku helps.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:47 PM;Yes and Rin-SV is of course Rin's SPHEREVISION(tm);;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:47 PM;bahaha;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:47 PM;Tbh tho I still like Dinoken's theory for X-3;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:48 PM;having it be about jenova and jenova clones.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:48 PM;talk about the existential crisis for nuTidus;;
Aruu#2066;12-Oct-17 02:48 PM;That would be really interesting if they did link it that way;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:48 PM;Honestly I kind of just want a game to give Jenova her due.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:49 PM;"She was said to be this _big threat_ but all we ever saw in VII was like, bits and pieces.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:49 PM;Because Sephiroth took center stage.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:49 PM;"And if they ever expand further on VII, it won't be Jenova";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:50 PM;G takes center stage next;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:50 PM;Or G and Weiss;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:50 PM;If they tackled Jenova it would need to be a prequel;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:51 PM;Which the X universe basically is so just take advantage of it while you can.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:52 PM;"I'm pretty sure they said that the Shinra thing was just meant as a nod to VII, not an actual link";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:52 PM;Or wait..;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:53 PM;It's a link;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:53 PM;Let me get the link lol.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:53 PM;https://thelifestream.net/canon-of-ffvii/is-ffvii-connected-to-ffx-and-x-2/;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:53 PM;"Basically almost everyone involved has said it's a canon link, and there's even an explanation given as to _how_";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:53 PM;"That was Sakaguchi, I guess he wasn't all that involved in X-2";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:54 PM;Nojima himself was the first one to say it was canon.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:55 PM;Still;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:55 PM;And Vegnagun is basically explained as a MAKO reactor.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:55 PM;Jenova being a thing in X-3 is unlikely;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:56 PM;"Yeah, unfortunately.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:56 PM;Still fun to speculate about.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:56 PM;I dunno;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:56 PM;She'd have to magically crash land on two very interconnected planets;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 02:56 PM;Or be from X's planet;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:57 PM;Well;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:57 PM;Let's think about Jenova and the humans for a second here;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:57 PM;The humans on Gaia specifically;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:57 PM;They came to Gaia... running from Jenova.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:57 PM;So either idea isn't exactly out of bounds given that we know that these humans are likely spirans.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 02:58 PM;"Maybe, since the Farplane and Lifestream are basically the same thing, Jenova is a massively powerful fiend spawned from the Farplane with the ability to manipulate it.";;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 03:02 PM;"Might be the same thing, not necessarily connected.. Given that each seems to be tied to the health of their planet, moreso than the universe as a whole.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:03 PM;My main reason for stating that was it could be why Jenova can effect the Lifestream.;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:04 PM;"Also, I'm doing more reading about the concept of Jenova, and it's possible that they might just fold some cut elements of her in VIIR.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:04 PM;Apparently in earlier drafts of VII she was more involved.;;
Malfred#1000;12-Oct-17 03:04 PM;One can hope;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:05 PM;"I have a working theory (working as in it works until it's disproven) that one of the ways in which VIIR will be made as long as it is, is that they're adding cut content.";;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:06 PM;"According to the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega, in an early version of the Final Fantasy VII script the fact the party is chasing Jenova rather than Sephiroth was made more explicit. During the party's confrontation with Jenova in Sephiroth's form on the cargo ship, Sephiroth would open his cape to shoot out a piece of Jenova, its hand. The Sephiroth Clones were not individual people infected with Jenova's cells but pieces of Jenova floating in air hiding under cloaks in the shapes of people. Each piece was named to be either its hand, thumb, or heart; this is why Cloud refers to Jenova∙BIRTH as the arm of Jenova upon its defeat. There were also two more boss fights: one between Cosmo Canyon and Nibelheim, and one in the Temple of the Ancients., , It has been suggested from the material present in the Ultimania Omega that rather than there being several Black Capes, there was just one, Jenova, who was cutting off bits of its body as it journeyed towards Sephiroth until all that remains is a heart. In the original version the party would catch up with the Black Cape in the Whirlwind Maze, and the figure would remove the hood to show it has no face, and then take off the cloak to show it is nothing but Jenova's heart floating midair, the final piece, which would then transform into a monster.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 03:30 PM;"I honestly though of a very similar theory yesterday, just not as fleshed out.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 03:32 PM;http://www.ign.com/faqs/2006/final-fantasy-vii-jenova-thesisfaq-706775 This is an interesting read concerning Jenova;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:45 PM;Re tactics: and featuring Cloud as a secret character plus Aerith as a npc;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:49 PM;oh yeah Cloud kinda sucks;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:49 PM;in Tactics;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:49 PM;since he starts at lvl 1;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;his limit breaks can only be done with a specific sword;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;and his limit breaks are slow;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;I'd have liked more Ivalician versions of characters in Tactics games.;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;now Balthier is OP;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;Balthier was in two right?;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;Twol;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:50 PM;yep;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:51 PM;and Vaan was in A2;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:51 PM;There's no real reason the whole xii crew couldn't be I'm a2 but lbr I'm selfish;;
Dark Sun#6195;12-Oct-17 03:51 PM;so basically Balthier can dual wied the 2 best swords in the game and hit with them 8 times for high damage;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:53 PM;Jfc;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 03:53 PM;That sounds broken;;
Lazareus#6641;12-Oct-17 08:11 PM;Was it ever explicitly stated in Final Fantasy that Garland was Chaos?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Oct-17 08:12 PM;FF1? Yeah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Oct-17 08:13 PM;in the NES version he was like Remember me? Garland? and I assume the line is similar in later versions;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Oct-17 08:13 PM;and then he gives a long-winded explanation of the time loop;;
Dinoken2#0946;12-Oct-17 08:13 PM;I believe he appears as Garland first as well and then transforms into Chaos;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Oct-17 08:13 PM;yep;;
Lazareus#6641;12-Oct-17 08:18 PM;That kinda sounds like something from Final Fantasy VIII;;
Dinoken2#0946;12-Oct-17 08:20 PM;"Probably.  I, VIII, and XIII-2 are all weird time travel games.";;
Dinoken2#0946;12-Oct-17 08:20 PM;So they all share some common themes and elements.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 08:44 PM;**puts on tinfoil hat** which means they're all the same game! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! **eye twitch**;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 08:46 PM;Princess Sarah reincarnates into Serah who becomes Ultimecia pass it on;;

Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 08:47 PM;Rinoa is not Ultimecia;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 08:47 PM;Via word of god;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 08:47 PM;is so!;;

Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 08:51 PM;I used to!;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 08:51 PM;I like the idea of Ultimecia having a tragic backstory now;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Oct-17 08:51 PM;"But yeah, Square has lied before";;

monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:03 PM;i just realized xv had a happy ending;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:03 PM;"the empire, the demons, and the lucian monarchy were destroyed";;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:04 PM;finally the people can rule themselves;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 09:04 PM;It's bittersweet;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:04 PM;is it;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 09:04 PM;Because everyone you come to care about over the course of the game is dead.;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:04 PM;i mean;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:05 PM;not really;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 09:05 PM;Yes tho?;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:05 PM;unless you only cared about noctis and luna;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 09:05 PM;Or the other Bros.;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:05 PM;they're not confirmed dead;;
monokomonoe#8934;12-Oct-17 09:06 PM;i guess its bittersweet because if noctis survived he could've just abdicated the throne and lived in the new communist lucis;;
Treble#5035;12-Oct-17 09:08 PM;They are likely dead tho;;
Leon#9542;12-Oct-17 09:09 PM;pretty sure Tabata confirmed they're alive in an interview recently;;

Yuna#0001;13-Oct-17 07:55 PM;"I just didnt think it was actual fire , some moves named after an ability are physical.";;
Mirron#9949;14-Oct-17 05:31 PM;I’m sure Ultimecia has a tragic backstory. The only question is what it is.;;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:31 PM;I saw a post on the sub around the time when i first joined that speculated on that.;;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:32 PM;"It basically had it that her mom was the Sorceress before her and got killed and that's how she got her power and she did everything she could _not_ to become Ultimecia but then lo and behold, circumstance happened.";;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:32 PM;Also like;;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:32 PM;"Ultimecia, at least the Ultimecia that's the main antagonist of FF8, probably doesn't exist anymore by the time you beat the game.";;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:33 PM;Effectively by taking on Squall and the SeeD that timeline is prevented.;;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:33 PM;"Erased, if you will";;
Treble#5035;14-Oct-17 05:34 PM;Ultimecia was her own undoing.;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:01 PM;MG1 isn't really worth it;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:01 PM;it's really good;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:02 PM;MG2 introduced;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:02 PM;it basically has all the mechanics that MGS1 would have;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:02 PM;other than being 3D;;
Seymour#0747;14-Oct-17 10:02 PM;I did actually play like 2 minutes of MGS1 on an emulator but I was having issues or something I forget;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:02 PM;and to me at least it's honestly worth having that background;;

Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;Either a manual or the physical thing you have;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;the MG2 manual also had a vital Transceiver frequency;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;I read them when they had second-hand cheat codes in the back.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;and also some interesting info;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;Not going to be specific here though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;the MG1 manual ... was the best part of MG1;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:04 PM;other than the cover;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:05 PM;the cover is literally just a slightly-edited picture of Kyle Reese;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:05 PM;that's fucking Kyle Reese;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:05 PM;"The third one, I think";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:06 PM;you mean Snake's Revenge?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:06 PM;that actually came out before the canon MG2;;

Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:06 PM;Snake looked like fuckin Stallone;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:06 PM;"It did introduce the cardboard box though, iirc";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:07 PM;nope;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:07 PM;cardboard box has been used by Solid Snake all the way back to the Outer Heaven uprising in MG1;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:07 PM;and boy did I make extensive use of it when I played MG1;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:11 PM;yah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:11 PM;okay so strictly speaking it wasn't his base we were moving through so that reply would be pointless;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Oct-17 10:11 PM;...I'm gonna stop being pedantic;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:12 PM;You fight the real one in MG2 though;;

Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:50 PM;"One sec, I'm trying to find the original paper that was talking about it";;
Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:51 PM;"Ah ok, so, Richard Dawkins argues in his 1976 book by the name of the Selfish Gene that there exists a new kind of replicator in a new primordial ooze";;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:52 PM;the hell does that mean;;
Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:53 PM;"This is going to be a bit complicated to explain: If you recall a lecture on the origins of life, you'll know that life started out as a replicating molecule. This molecule would eventually mutate into what we now know as DNA. Within this molecule exists little bits of information known as genes";;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:54 PM;Yeah;;
Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:54 PM;"These genes get passed down from one generation to another, and which genes get passed down is chosen through a process known as natural selection";;
Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:55 PM;The primordial ooze back then was just essentially water with a whole bunch of random chemicals in it;;
Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:56 PM;"Richard Dawkins, (in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene) argues that there is a new primordial ooze: Human consciosness. He also argues that there is a new form of life, a new form of replicator which he dubs: memes.";;
Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 10:57 PM;Memes (in his definition) just refers to ideas. They act very much like viruses do as they jump and burrow into other people's consciousness. The form of transmission? Communication.;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:57 PM;Well;;
Marcello#4574;14-Oct-17 10:57 PM;That explains MGS 2 and 5;;

Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 11:01 PM;"MGS2 gets laughed at for using the term, but really, they're using the term in its original definition, which is a lot more serious. What the AIs of MGS2 propose is to institute a sort of natural selection to this new form of life.";;

Davkilla101#0932;14-Oct-17 11:04 PM;"A little bit more info on the term meme: ```The Selfish Gene was published in 1976 by the Oxford University Press, and presents a gene-centered view of evolution in order to explain how behaviors like altruism could be adaptive. When discussing how natural selection might extend beyond biological replication, Dawkins proposed that ideas could be subject to Darwinian principles as well, since they appear to replicate by means of cultural transmission. To label this kind of information, Dawkins coined the word “meme” as the cultural analog to a gene. The word originates from the Greek word “mimeme”, meaning “imitated thing”. Under the Dawkins definition, a meme can be any idea, behavior or trend that has the ability to transmit from person to person.```";;

Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 01:14 AM;"FFVIII being a closed time loop makes Ultimecia more sad. Ultimecia has to still exist, because she leads to the creation of the organization that defeats her.";;

Blue#9087;15-Oct-17 06:43 AM;I wish Square Enix would talk about FF8's ending. It was extremely confusing.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 07:05 AM;It's just a time loop.;;
Blue#9087;15-Oct-17 07:10 AM;ohhhh;;

Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 07:12 AM;"I mean I could try to clear up particular questions, but the general gist is that, it's a time loop. Squall defeats Ultimecia, Time Compression and all that starts unraveling. Ultimecia goes back in time to deliver her power to Edea, Squall helps create SeeD, and then he gets rescued by Rinoa.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 07:12 AM;Assuming I recall the rough bit of it entirely. I've been up all night so I could be forgetting something.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:02 AM;"As a comic book fan, what would likely happen is divergent timelines.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:02 AM;Like Drakengard.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:02 AM;"So one timeline leads to Ultimecia still existing, the other leads to a more idyllic world where the woman who evevntually became Ultimeca _exists_ but never became Ultimecia.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:05 AM;That depends on how they do time travel.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:05 AM;"Some places have divergent timelines, some have time loops.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:07 AM;The idea of a time loop is massively depressing tbh;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:07 AM;I'd prefer to think that the main timeline avoided it.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:08 AM;"I mean, it kind of is, yeah. But I think that's kind of the point.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:09 AM;"Otherwise the whole bit where Squall inspires the existence of SeeD seems kind of... moot, for starters. As well as Ultimecia going back in time to give Edea her powers.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:09 AM;That's where comic book mentality comes in.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:09 AM;Changes to the existing timeline are maintained even if it becomes divergent.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:10 AM;"Yeah, but VIII doesn't really seem likely to do alternate timelines. If they did it feels like something they'd mention.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:11 AM;Alternate realities in FF weren't really touched on until XIII-2.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:11 AM;I can see them going for it.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:11 AM;"We'll never really know unless they revisit the universe, which seems unlikely for the list of games they might one day revisit.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:11 AM;"Alternate realities? I mean, FFT has it basically.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:11 AM;Cloud is from a different reality.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:12 AM;"And yeah, they won't revisit it I'm sure. Gilgamesh too thinking on it.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:12 AM;Theoretically Gogo.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:13 AM;Wasn't Gilgamesh done retroactively?;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:13 AM;I didn't know that about Tactics lol.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:13 AM;"I thought they just made Cloud, but in Ivalice.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:15 AM;"Nope, he's pulled through a tunnel. And Gilgamesh appears from the Void in FFVIII.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:16 AM;"Tunnel, why did I word it that way.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:16 AM;"He's teleported in from elsewhere, Cloud is.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:16 AM;Add to the reasons why I need to actually play and beat TWOL.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:16 AM;I believe the standing theory is it's a shard of Cloud from the whole coma Cloud time period.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:19 AM;@Fancy#0940  You didn't want to consider that it could happen to a main character.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:20 AM;But I think it's been a thing for Final Fantasy to have a primary supporting or main cast member die since at least FFIV.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:20 AM;"Actually, no, 3.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:20 AM;Aria Bennett.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:20 AM;I don't count 2's wheel of death;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:21 AM;FFII.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:21 AM;Oh. Lol.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:21 AM;That totally counts. 😛;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:21 AM;It's not like every guest dies.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:22 AM;But yeah... pretty sure... every FF has someone who dies. VIII I guess avoids it. There are a couple.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:22 AM;VIII has Rayne.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:22 AM;At least that's who I'm counting.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:22 AM;I wasn't counting her given she wasn't part of the party even kind of.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:23 AM;That's why I mentioned supporting cast as well;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:23 AM;"If we count NPC's then... every FF would, yeah.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:23 AM;"I mean, if nothing else, the villains.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:23 AM;If we DON'T count the NPCs then VI and VIII subvert the trope.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:23 AM;XII as well.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:25 AM;Hence why I wouldn't count NPC's. Though I'd count Leo for VI given he had a sprite.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:25 AM;In that case I suppose you could count Rasler as well.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:25 AM;But... ehhhh.;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:26 AM;just noticed the spoilers tag sorry;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:26 AM;You're good.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:26 AM;Based on the white name you're new so lol.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:26 AM;I'd be fine counting Rasler.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:26 AM;Rasler _and_ Recks actually;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:26 AM;I forgot about Recks.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;"Recks, yeah, that's who I thought you meant.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;"We don't see Rasler do anything, do we? And aren't there guests who die?";;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;i've only played vii ix and am currently working on x but i'd noticed that a main character dying is a recurring theme;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;I don't know all the guests in XII so I can't say for sure.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;~~I haven't finished XII~~;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;but aeriths death made me more pissed off than sad tbh;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;"The only guest that I know of for sure is Larsa, and Ashe as Amalia.";;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:27 AM;oh i played xii like three times but still haven't finished it because i always get bored of it;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:28 AM;but i love the theme so i keep getting sucked back in;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:28 AM;It's long and incredibly political.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:28 AM;"So yeah, most FF's someone dies. VIII is the only one I can think of where every guest lives for sure. And... XIII.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:28 AM;I guess FFI if you want to count it.;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:28 AM;@Treble#5035 i'm not big on the grinding either;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;There are a few games that _use_ the death trope and do it differently.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;XIII is one of them.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;"Oh, yeah, XIII proper kind of has it.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;Apparently the grinding isn't as bad in TZA?;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;So that might be a thing you wanna do.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;I believe the grinding is the same except you can speed it up.;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;is that the steam port;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:29 AM;There isn't a Steam port yet but it's the one that will be on Steam;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:30 AM;ah good i enjoy the fast forward function. i've been using it a lot to get through x;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:30 AM;"XIII-2 also plays the death trope straight, and then it's entirely subverted at the end of LR.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:30 AM;I wouldn't count XIII in general mostly because it had sequels planned from the get go.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:30 AM;I didn't know that.;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:30 AM;did you enjoy xiii;;
Fancy#0940;15-Oct-17 09:30 AM;i bought it on steam and played about 10 hours before getting a refund xD;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:31 AM;I liked XIII a lot.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:31 AM;I like XIII a lot but _not_ for the gameplay or the dungeons.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:31 AM;For the plot and the characters.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:31 AM;"And I believe the ending of XIII has Lightning vanish, with a bit of XIII-2 included somewhere.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:31 AM;So I'm... 99% sure they planned for a sequel from the get go.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:31 AM;"Nah, the ending of XIII is a happy ending.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:32 AM;You're remembering the opening of XIII-2.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:32 AM;"Which alters the ending of XIII (as per it's plot) so that Lightning disappeared and Serah and Dajh were only met by Sazh, Snow, and Hope.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:32 AM;It was assumed as a result that Lightning was a part of Ragnarok.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:33 AM;http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII_-Episode_i-;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:33 AM;It's this I'm remembering.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:33 AM;Which I believe came out pretty much right at release.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:34 AM;Ohhh;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:34 AM;"Because I remember at release, people were talking about Lightning vanishing. So it was probably already out in Japan. Like most things I doubt it came out here.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:36 AM;They probably decided to do the sequel in the middle of development.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:36 AM;Too late to change the ending to reflect that.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:36 AM;Plus if the game ended on a cliffhanger like that I feel like people would've felt jipped.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:37 AM;"Look at the backlash XV got by the implication, incorrect or otherwise, that the Chocobros died.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:37 AM;"I mean, FFX is pretty loved though.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:37 AM;Tidus and Auron.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;15-Oct-17 09:38 AM;I wonder if most people sat through the X credits to see Tidus rise up from the water.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:38 AM;"But yeah, I was just explaining why I wouldn't count XIII. It kind of feels like Vanille/Fang were planned from the get go to come back.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:39 AM;"I didn't, but I think at this point most people know it's there.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:39 AM;I was completely surprised when I played through X-2 and found out Tidus comes back.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:39 AM;There were a few things in XIII that they did in the following games.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:39 AM;I wouldn't say that had to be a sequel hook though.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:39 AM;Serah as a party member/lead character and the Oerba girls coming back come to mind right away.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:40 AM;I feel like it could easily be an afterlife kind of thing originally.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:40 AM;"Eh, it may not be a hook per se, but it's what necessitated X-2.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:40 AM;Nah;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:40 AM;It wasn't.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:40 AM;"Going into X-2 they knew that their overall goal was to explain what the ending was, how Tidus came back, etc.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:40 AM;In the _actual game_ it feels sort of secondary but that's okay.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:41 AM;Wiki says otherwise.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:41 AM;FFX wasn't originally planned to have a sequel.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:42 AM;I didn't say that tho;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:42 AM;X-2 came out at a time that even the compilation of VII wasn't really a thing. Of course X wasn't originally planned to have a sequel.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:42 AM;Then I'm not sure quite where you're going with this.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:42 AM;I was saying that going into developing X-2's story they knew they wanted to expand on Tidus at the end of X.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:43 AM;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/8/87/X2pre-concept_3.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100207035056;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:43 AM;?;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:43 AM;I guess Paine was originally supposed to have long blondeish hair? lol.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:44 AM;"That's odd looking. But yeah, I'm not seeing anything that says Tidus is meant to be alive in the ending.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:44 AM;Because that's Yuna on the left.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:44 AM;That's pretty red.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:45 AM;It might be from Eternal Calm.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:45 AM;Overall it seems like it was Eternal Calm that necessitated the sequel reading this now.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:46 AM;"Sure, but that's not the original game.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:46 AM;"Granted, it seems like novels in general make things worse.";;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:47 AM;The original game does leave a question of what the post credit scene is supposed to mean at the least.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:47 AM;Which is probably why _Eternal Calm_ exists.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:47 AM;"Sure, but VII does too.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:47 AM;FF in general has... perplexing endings to an extent.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:48 AM;XV's novel where Lunafreya comes back powered by Bahamut trying to crash the moon into the planet really will make the sequel weird.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:48 AM;What....;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:48 AM;o_o;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:48 AM;Was making a XIV joke comparing her to Nael. Came to me.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:48 AM;OH.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:49 AM;I thought that was legit for a second.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:49 AM;lmao.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:49 AM;"It is based off of FF, so I mean... yeah. 😛 Just not XV.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:49 AM;I figured it would sound vaguely plausible. But I bet there will be a XV novel that messes things up.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:49 AM;Nah I'm not so sure.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:50 AM;I think XV will just keep getting story updates and dlc that will mess with it.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:50 AM;They've stated their intent to do as much.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:54 AM;I wouldn't be surprised if we get a sequel in general.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 09:57 AM;They're pushing XV a ton. It's just a matter of how long they'll keep up the current trend. May get a prequel instead I suppose.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:57 AM;Their interest seems to lay in DLC episodes.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:57 AM;So we'll see.;;
Treble#5035;15-Oct-17 09:58 AM;"The only sequel I can think of would just be Episode Ardyn, which is the DLC most people want so we'll likely get it.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:00 AM;"Yeah, but once that's run it's course it'll get a sequel I'm sure. I'm not talking right now, more like... I don't know, a couple years down the line maybe.";;
Davkilla101#0932;15-Oct-17 05:13 PM;@Marcello#4574 can I just say that the Metal Gear in this game scares the shit outta me?;;

Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:30 PM;It’s basically every FF almost.;;
Blue#9087;15-Oct-17 10:34 PM;sin was just jecht.;;
Blue#9087;15-Oct-17 10:34 PM;"that's it, nothing more.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:35 PM;Not even that really.;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:35 PM;Did sin do anything else besides destroy stuff;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:35 PM;Or was that it really;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:35 PM;And who do you think is XIII’s main villain Blue?;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:35 PM;"The villain in X is more like, the overall system.";;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:35 PM;I havent played X in a while so im not too familiar;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:36 PM;"Sin is just part of it. But it’s Church of Yevon too, and the Final Aeon bit.";;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:36 PM;It’s the entire spiral of death.;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:36 PM;But Sin is the main villain right;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:36 PM;And wasnt really a person but more of a natural disaster like you said;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:36 PM;Arguable.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:37 PM;Sin is a goal to beat is how I see it.;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:37 PM;Are main villains that have like 0 personalities always bad or just sometimes bad;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:37 PM;X doesn’t really have a main villain.;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:37 PM;3 had a fuck ton of villains;;

MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:39 PM;3 had a stupid plot;;

MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:40 PM;And that kinda stuff bothers me;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:40 PM;As if the only reason you as the character specifically had to save the world was bc someone else simply told you to;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:40 PM;And nothing more;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:40 PM;"I mean, it’s an early FF.";;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:41 PM;Yeah you're right;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:41 PM;But idk i feel as if all games should have a reasoning behind why you have to save the world that reaches beyond someone else told you to;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:41 PM;But unfortunately that isnt the case;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:41 PM;FFIV almost everyone is motivated by revenge.;;

MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:42 PM;Probably the hardest FF game;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:42 PM;No real characters.;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:43 PM;The characters are all 1 dimensional;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:43 PM;I only enjoyed the gameplay section of 3;;
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA#8500;15-Oct-17 10:43 PM;The music was decent ish;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 10:46 PM;Yeah. Supposedly the characters are better in Japan.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Oct-17 11:01 PM;The reason I like Emperor Mateus is because he managed (if only temporarily) to become the ruler of both aspects of the afterlife.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Oct-17 11:01 PM;It's just an interesting and unique concept.;;
Mirron#9949;15-Oct-17 11:08 PM;And it was all his plan.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Oct-17 11:25 PM;"exactly, I love it when villains fulfill their plans, even if they're defeated afterwards";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;15-Oct-17 11:25 PM;that's what makes Kefka great too;;
monokomonoe#8934;16-Oct-17 12:06 AM;yeah it was interesting in VI how it was like what would happen if the party actually failed and the villain took over the world;;
monokomonoe#8934;16-Oct-17 12:06 AM;but the party managed to recover from that and beat them anyway;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 05:54 PM;"So, Aerith's theme is song number 63, in the OST, out of 85 songs. So, she dies about 3/4ths into the game (74%) according to the OST. IMO, that aligns pretty well with story placement.";;
themockingguy#6969;16-Oct-17 05:56 PM;I think most OST's order the track list in order of apperance;;
themockingguy#6969;16-Oct-17 05:58 PM;That's why in most FF OST you have the victory fanfare and the gameover music right next to the battle music;;
themockingguy#6969;16-Oct-17 05:58 PM;is the earliest you could hear either of those;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:01 PM;"In most cases, yeah, however, you first hear Aeris's theme when you find out she's an oprhan, back when you're still in Midgar.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:02 PM;"With the OST, you hear it, in align with Gold Saucer/Temple of the Ancients";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:02 PM;This was done on purpose;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:02 PM;"Fan/sad fact: You only here her theme twice: In Midgar, with the flashback, and when she dies.";;
themockingguy#6969;16-Oct-17 06:05 PM;"That's definitely on purpose, maybe because that's the most impactful moment that the track is heard.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:06 PM;"But yeah, it makes me sad knowing it happens so late in the game";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:06 PM;"Cause, unlike 8 and 9, 7's disk 1 is *long*";;
themockingguy#6969;16-Oct-17 06:08 PM;You get to disk 2 until you exit midgar for the first time IIRC;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:11 PM;"Unless things are different with PS1 (I grew up playing the PC version), disk 1 ends with Aerith's death.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:11 PM;Only three disks;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:12 PM;"Disk 2 ends with the raid of Midgar, and the death of Diamond Weapon";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Oct-17 06:19 PM;"I know 7 *extremely* well. Like the only things I don't know by heart are most to all enemy names, and attack patterns.";;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:35 PM;Yeah.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:36 PM;If they were placed earlier 13 would have been better recieved I think.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:36 PM;He's at least a third into the game.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:38 PM;"I mean you can’t really just auto battle without intelligently switching and planning around your roles, which already takes the wind out of the sails of that claim.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:39 PM;I mean there are a lot of bosses that can be solved by using Lightning as the party lead and using auto battle.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:39 PM;"And IX has flaws, every FF has them. But IX is pretty amazing overall. I still find Beatrix a really big flaw with IX.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:39 PM;And switching between COM/RAV/COM or RAV/RAV/COM;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:39 PM;Or RAV/MED/COM;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:40 PM;"That’s three different roles, and that’s still decisions you have to make. It also doesn’t really seem all that different from older FFs except they cut out the middle man.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:41 PM;Yeah but the point is the AI does most of the work this way.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:41 PM;You just have to look at the screen and think:;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:41 PM;I think Barth's placement was ideal;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:41 PM;"Do I need to deal some damage, or up the stagger gauge?";;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:41 PM;It's when the game throws everything at you and makes you actually learn how to play it;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:41 PM;With the added question of if you need someone healed.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:42 PM;The really memorable battle are the ones where I needed a Sen or Sab.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:42 PM;Pretty much only leveled those for bosses.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:42 PM;"Up until that point, you didn't need to put a lot of thought on your paradigms";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;"I think I still managed to beat Bart inside of ten tries though, and that's a lot.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;I pretty much used those combinations unless I was in a boss.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;No need to make a thread for it.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;I tried not to need a Sab though;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;"I mean, that’s why I said it cuts out the middle man.";;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;The fun part of XIII is spending 20 minutes in just one boss and dying;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;Because I didn't like to use Sazh and Fang wasn't that great of a Sab;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:43 PM;Makes you learn how to mash your controller faster;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:44 PM;Most FFs you don’t even need to put in that much effort.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:44 PM;There was actually only one boss in XIII that gave me trouble outside of Orphan.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:44 PM;The boss AI was varied enough that I could retry a few times before it got stale.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:44 PM;Dahaka.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:44 PM;IDEK why.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:44 PM;The only fight I had a lot of trouble with in XIII was Hecatoncheir.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;Hecatoncheir was tough indeed;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;Oh yeah;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;Hecaton was a biiiitch;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;The Aeon fights in general were worse than most of the bosses.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;The rest of the eidolons were pretty easy though.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;"Eidolon, sorry.";;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;Odin gave me a wee bit of trouble though.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;I'm trying to remember if I had any trouble with any of them;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;I consider the first one hard too;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:45 PM;Other than Hecaton;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;Maybe Bryndhildr?;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;Because I didn't really get the paradigm system that point;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;So I stop playing the game for 1 year lel;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;Which was the first again? Odin or Shiva?;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;Shiva;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;Shiva;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;"They have very particular kinks, and are tough to please.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;God I need to replay XIII.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;You can't just beat on them and hope.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;The last time I played it was... the first time I played it.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;I was 14.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;I recently replayed XIII.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:46 PM;"That was 8 years ago, shit.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;I wouldn't have liked it 5 years ago.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;"The best team is definitely Vanille, Lightning, and Sazh.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;"Oddly, it works better as an adult.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;Light Hope Fang dream team;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;"I liked Light, Hope, and Vanille.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;Most magic team.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;Maybe because younger you just wanted plain action and simple games?;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;"As you might be able to guess, I went through the game without a sentinel. It's tough.";;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;It was the case with me;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:47 PM;I was into FF by then.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;I used to freak out playing Chicken Run on the PS1;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;So I doubt that was it.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;Light/Hope/Fang gives you all the necessary roles. So do Light/Vanille/Fang.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;"Light, Fang, Vanille was my final party I believe.";;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;"Well in the end all roles are given, but yeah.";;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;"But yeah, I would say XIII if anything tends to offer more potentially challenging questions than most FFs. Usually the question for others is if you need to grind more, not tactics.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:48 PM;I mean with the initial Crystarium roles.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:49 PM;Sazh is a beast with bosses because of blitz;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:49 PM;Of course.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:49 PM;Those set ups give all the roles.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:49 PM;I used him for haste.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:49 PM;And that was all.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:50 PM;"For easy fights I usually just have it with Lightning as a commando, Sazh as a ravager, and Vanille as a medic.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:50 PM;I tended to use Hope as my party leader so I could baby him;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:50 PM;"So I often had him as Ravager and had Fang and Lightning as commando, or Light also as rav.";;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:50 PM;"But as far as bosses go, Evened Odds (MED, SAB, SYN) was one of, if not the most important paradigms.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:51 PM;Relentless Assault was probably my most common paradigm in both games.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:51 PM;Hope is cute lol.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:51 PM;I liked Hope as my leader.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:51 PM;"By which I mean adult Hope in 13-2, because the ages of fictional characters are totally super important.";;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;I just used Lightning as my leader because of being the main character.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;"Hope in general is super cute, whether he's 14 or 24. 🤷";;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;"It's because COM/RAV/RAV is the best paradigm for staggering. Unless you drop 3x RAV, but that only works for quick fights";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;Light is kinda the MC.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;I did RAV3 in XIII-2 a lot.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;But she's too stoic to fill the role alone.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:52 PM;But that's because I had more confidence in my party in that game than my party in XIII.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:53 PM;Most of the development ends up on Hope.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:53 PM;Serah and Noel are both very hardy by nature of them both being commandoes.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:53 PM;XIII-2 was too easy;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:53 PM;I could beat multiple bosses without even leveling;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:53 PM;"It was piss easy, yeah.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:53 PM;"Main campaign anyway, some side stuff was tough.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;I feel like I remember it having a difficulty setting;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;but idk;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;IDR.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;"it's been a long time; not AS long as XIII but a long time.";;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;"Normal and easy, just like XIII on PC";;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;Really? I somehow had more trouble with XIII-2 than XIII.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;^ I think I did too.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;Fucking Adam for instance.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;(ayooo);;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:54 PM;I didn't run into any hitches until the end boss.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;And didn't grind much either.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;The final boss is weird;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;The end boss was actually easy for me the first time.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;It could've been because I didn't switch monsters often.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;But then.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;I went to do it _again_;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;And for some reason had trouble.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;3x Rav is fine if you get in a hit of Com.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;I hated the monsters mechanic on that game;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;I think I got one of the OP chocobos pretty early.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;That’s what I usually did.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;Maybe that was why I had an easy time.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;They need some decent grinding otherwise are just useless;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;"I had a bunch of trouble with the final boss for the longest time, but when I finally beat it, it was easy as shit.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;I don't remember what monsters  I used.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:55 PM;But I remember that;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;I used a Flan type a lot.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;Chocobos are great.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;Stylish and useful.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;also;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;never forgot;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;forget;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;And the silver one kills it in the races.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;CRAZY CHOCOBO;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;I love that song.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;"Stupid mechanic and song, tbh";;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;"I remember using the Dragoon as a commando, and the Flanitor as my medic by the end of the game. I can't remember what my ravager monster was though.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:56 PM;So silly and nice.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:57 PM;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUOOgNzOv4;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:57 PM;I would go on foot just to not listen that song and waste my greens;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:57 PM;So... chocobo riding is a stupid mechanic?;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:57 PM;❓ ❓ ❓;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:57 PM;"No, riding chocobos and consuming greens while you ride them";;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 09:57 PM;I think that they try to do more with it but honestly outside of IX I haven’t been a fan of their attempts.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:58 PM;You just use one green to ride a common chocobo;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:58 PM;"Yeah, I can agree with that.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:58 PM;Eh I was okay with it.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:58 PM;But the other ones keep draining your greens;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:58 PM;The birds are fun.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;They needed to do something other than silly music to show that something was inherently _wrong_ with these chocobos.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;Less creepy to control than anime mcschoolgirl.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;"The best element of that game, besides Caius, was Mog";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;"Wearing, like, what's her outfit?";;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;"The rest... eh, not so much";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;Honestly I love XIII-2.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;I prefer XIII in most aspects;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;"Not much, I remember.";;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;I love Serah and Noel. I love Caius. I love Yeul. I love the chocobos. I love Mog.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;Throwing Mog was quite fun.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 09:59 PM;Mog is great.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;"XIII-2 had a faster battle system, but wasn't as satisfying as in XIII";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;I actually think my Mog is 13-2 Mog lol.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;The only thing that made it less satisfying to me is the ending.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;I don't really like Serah because I'm not too big on the I want to save everybody whiny protagonists.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;I mean I didn't really see her as whiny.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;I guess you hate Snow then;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;I saw Serah more as a self sacrifical protagonist;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;"She probably wasn't that bad, but I didn't like her.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;TBH most of those characters deserve to be whiny.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:00 PM;like yuna and aerith but also more determined.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;or... not determined.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;I didn't like Yuna or Aerith either.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;Serah just didn't have any depth;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;Not getting into whether Serah is one.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;more clearly protagonistic.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;Noel had more development and story;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;I think they both had story and development and depth.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;I actually do like Snow though.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;But.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;"...not much development, but I liked his story";;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;I didn’t like XIII-2 much.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;Noel' was more evident because it happened in the game entirely.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;Not a fan of monsters.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;Whereas Serah's was naturally part backstory.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:01 PM;From _another game._;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;XIII is definitely my favorite in the trilogy.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;I like Noel more than Snow.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;Noel and Serah are two of my favorite FF characters tbh.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;"I prefer Snow, but I did like Noel.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;Snow was awful for me.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;I don't think he was a bad character.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;I definitely understand why people dislike Snow though.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;Maybe it's because I latched onto Hope as a fellow 14 y/o when I played XIII but I hated Snow?;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;"I wish XIII-2 and LR never existed, to be honest. Maybe as spin-offs or games with a different lore and story, but XIII's story should had been left untouched.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:02 PM;I just didn't like him.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;But also he just annoys the shit out of me.;;
Mirron#9949;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;I like Snow.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;He's hot tho;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;He has that big dumb face like most of the X cast.;;
4976#3971;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;Snow kind of reminded me of Zidane in that he often tried to stay positive.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;Snow is a 😄 emoji;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:03 PM;brought to life in a ff world;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:04 PM;on a Bara Daddy™ body;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:05 PM;His outfit doesn't do it for me.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:05 PM;Seems really generic.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:05 PM;17 layers.;;
Marcello#4574;18-Oct-17 10:06 PM;He is generic.;;
Treble#5035;18-Oct-17 10:06 PM;I like Snow better when he doesn't have his shirt on.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;18-Oct-17 10:06 PM;Absurd collar.;;

Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:46 AM;But again - it's not bad.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:47 AM;It lacks a compelling lead - either protagonistic or antagonistic - in either Cloud or Sephiroth.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:47 AM;"The story isn't bad per se, but it's also not that great either. The pacing is off, either too fast at certain points or too slow at others.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:47 AM;I advise you to take a closer look at Cloud;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;I agree that Sephiroth is by no means a great villain;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;but Cloud is an amazing protagonist;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;I've taken plenty of looks but I feel like my opinion of him is likely tainted by the rest of the compilation and what is now canon Cloud.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;Because we never saw True Cloud in VII and they capitalized on that.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;"we have, though";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;We saw Zack Fair as played by Cloud Strife;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;have you played Crisis Core?;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:48 AM;"I've seen playthroughs, but that's still not base VII.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:49 AM;"you're contradicting yourself, then";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:49 AM;Not really.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:49 AM;you're saying CC should not be taken into account ebcause it's not base VII but you say you don't like cloud because of the compilation;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:49 AM;What I said was we don't see the actual Cloud in the base game.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:49 AM;yes we do though?;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:49 AM;"So, as a result of _that_, when forming the rest of the compilation they took the opportunity to see what we do see of Cloud and... make an entirely different character.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;here's how I like to think about it;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;Most of the cast of characters _outside_ of those two are wasted or their potential is ruined. The best example of this is how Tifa goes from being written competently to taking a complete backseat to Cloud after Cloud gets put back together.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;"and don't get me wrong, I hate emo Cloud from AC, but it does make sense for him to be taht way";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;She goes from leading the band to just being Cloud's Girlfriend.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;"Oh, I wasn't saying it didn't make sense for him to go all emo and PTSD, I should clarify.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;she... doesn't though?;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;I just don't _like him_ like that.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;She does.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:50 AM;She really does lol.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:51 AM;VII suffers from a surplus of cut content and a lack of time to focus on it's supporting cast outside of certain points.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:51 AM;I'm really missing your point here;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:51 AM;the side characters get plenty of development;;
Blue#9087;20-Oct-17 11:51 AM;I think the problem with VII is that it was poorly translated and overhyped;;
Blue#9087;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;*has never played VII*;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;No they don't though?;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;They get snippets.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;No character in VII really gets any decent development to be frank.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;"People complain about VIII lacking development, but it's an issue present in VII as well.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;except maybe for Vincent;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:52 AM;"but well, he literally has an entire game for that";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:53 AM;Vincent and Yuffie are both mostly just there. They get character beats but nothing to develop them.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:53 AM;Everyone else gets character beats that _happen_ but aren't captalized on.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:53 AM;"There's nothing all that different about Barret from the point that we meet him to endgame, for instance. He just has his thing with Marlene's real dad.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:53 AM;are you serious? what the fuck?;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:54 AM;Hell the only one I can say actually has significant enough development is probably Cid.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:54 AM;Barret begins as this guy who wants to fight for the planet but really just wants to get revenge on Shinra for what they did to his hometown;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:54 AM;he ends the game as a worried father who wants to create a better world for Marlene;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:54 AM;you really missed the point of VII;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:54 AM;Not really.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;even cait sith gets decent development;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;It's a writing flaw.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;and that's saying something;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;You can _say_ that's what their standpoint is but it's all in characterization.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;VII's gets about as much development as VIII's does;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;Which is to say... not a lot at all.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:55 AM;"In VIII if your name isn't Squall, Rinoa, or Seifer then you don't really develop much. It's the same in VII.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:56 AM;a huge problem I have with VIII is that it jusr turns into Squall and Rinoa after like the half of disc 2;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:56 AM;the other characters are just there for the most part;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:56 AM;that it definetely not an issue with VII;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:56 AM;everyone has significant reasons for fighting;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 11:57 AM;VII fares better than VIII in terms of charcter development imo. but neither are great for a big story. VII being good enough for an FF.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;"i love VIII, but I can say that the plot is objectively convoluted and no one gets any development";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;"hell, you could say even Squall has shallow development";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;I mean I wasn't saying they didn't have a reason for fighting;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;"I said that they they lack characterization, or at least, character progression.";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;Which is true.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;it really isn't;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;"And tbh in VII a few of the characters even feel samey at certain points, which might be a translation error.";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;none of the characters are the same at the end of the game;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;they all change;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 11:58 AM;in a very significant way;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 11:59 AM;I mean I know for a fact that saying all of them changed is _wrong._;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 12:00 PM;Because Yuffie and Vincent are insignificant in the overall scheme of things.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 12:00 PM;Even if I'm being hard on the game I know _that_ for sure.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 12:00 PM;they are literally extra characters who are not even mandatory to the plot;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 12:00 PM;i don't know what the hell you'd expect;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 12:00 PM;of course they're insignificant to the plot of the main game;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 12:00 PM;they're not even part of the main cast to begin with;;

Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 03:45 PM;In one of the art pieces for the game it shows her entirely nude and the only part of her body that is blacked out is her pelvic area.;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:11 PM;Guys please stay in here;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:12 PM;spoilers needs to change it's name to FF Talk;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 04:13 PM;but then people would not be warned about being spoiled in here;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 04:13 PM;general and offtopic should just merge;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 04:13 PM;i dont know man shits weird;;

mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 04:21 PM;*gasp*;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:23 PM;geez man;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:23 PM;took it too far;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 04:25 PM;Sephiroth was frogs the whole time;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:25 PM;i'd like sephiroth more if he was frogs.;;
HayleeLOL#0964;20-Oct-17 04:27 PM;you never see the frog enemies in temple of the ancients and sephy in the same room/screen;;
HayleeLOL#0964;20-Oct-17 04:27 PM;i wonder why 🤔;;
Marcello#4574;20-Oct-17 04:27 PM;I'd like Sephiroth more if he had any story and development outside of the flashbacks;;
Marcello#4574;20-Oct-17 04:28 PM;He was just underwhelming as a main villain;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:28 PM;@Seymour#0747 We have now entered the frog lock;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:29 PM;Sepiroth is a bit overhyped;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 04:30 PM;I love that Dunkey vid. one of my favourites from him;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:30 PM;Then again I think you could argue that the series as a whole doesn't have very compelling villians;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:30 PM;"They have a few, but they are outnumbered.";;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 04:30 PM;yep. Aesthetically compelling though;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:30 PM;"@Seymour#0747 Yeah same, though I think his History of Gaming is my favorite of his";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:31 PM;Personally I like Kefka the most but he doesn't get that much screen time or developement;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:31 PM;Arydn was suprisingly good as well;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 04:31 PM;"without any regard of how well written the villain is, my favourite is Seymour. Kefka next probably";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:32 PM;I could kinda tell by the name;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:32 PM;lol;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:32 PM;Seymour is INCREDIBLY well written though;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:32 PM;I fuckin' hate him tho;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:33 PM;"Meh, I'll be honest nothing about the FFX universe does it for me. I really wish I could understand and apreciate the love for the game but it did nothing for me.";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:33 PM;I did like the battle system and music though;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:33 PM;except for that dreadful screamo song;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Oct-17 04:36 PM;Did you beat the game?;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:36 PM;Yes;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:43 PM;but FFX is the same as FFVII;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:44 PM;legends say that Tidus is Cloud's ancestor;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:44 PM;because Blonde;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:44 PM;That doesn't make the games remotely similar;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:44 PM;but tidus is a bottle blonde;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:44 PM;FFX-2 officially tied the two games together;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:45 PM;I know;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:45 PM;okay;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Oct-17 04:45 PM;"```, the series as a whole doesn't have very compelling villians, ```, Caius and Kefka are probably the top ones moreso Caius because he's so relatable as a person";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:46 PM;"Yeah, I know but I did say as a whole";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:46 PM;Kefka is my favorite;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:46 PM;kefka is the joker;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:46 PM;"Yeah, that's why I like him";;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:46 PM;that's why I don't like him lol;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:47 PM;I like the psychopath villian archetype;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:47 PM;all the villains are psychopaths;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Oct-17 04:47 PM;funny enough;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Oct-17 04:47 PM;I like both Kefka and Joker;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Oct-17 04:47 PM;lmao;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:47 PM;"I would dissagree,, Kefka is a Sadist";;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:48 PM;that's just a type of psychopath;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:48 PM;Sociopaths lack empathy but are not violent;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:48 PM;Psychopaths lack empathy and are violent;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:48 PM;I wouldn't call Golbez a pyschopath;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:48 PM;then there's sub-types;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:48 PM;he's logical and has a purpose to what he's doing;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:49 PM;I'd say he is a misled purposeful fool who believes the ends justify the means;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:49 PM;so he's a lesser psychopath I suppose;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:50 PM;he does have some empathy;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:50 PM;but Golbez isn't really the main villain;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:50 PM;"I wouldn't call any of the early villians, except maybe the emperor, pychopaths";;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:50 PM;Exdeath is definitely a psychopath even if he is calculating;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:51 PM;I know he isn't but the other villian has no depth;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:51 PM;He is the villian for almost the entire duration of the story;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:51 PM;it's who the character fight against;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:52 PM;Zemus is litterally just evil for the sake of being evil;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:52 PM;that's a psychopath;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:52 PM;total lack of empathy;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:52 PM;That's called lazy writing;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:52 PM;call a psychopath a lazy thinker lol;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:52 PM;these kinds of people do exist;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:53 PM;I actually do think it is a kind of stupidity but they are still dangerous;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:53 PM;Are you trying to defend Zemus?;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:53 PM;Who the hell likes or remebers Zemus?;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:53 PM;I'm saying it isn't lazy writing;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:53 PM;I mean;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:53 PM;I remember all of the final bosses;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:54 PM;"I don't remember Zemus' personality/character, because there is nothing to remember";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:54 PM;^;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:55 PM;so if you forget something then it was unimportant;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:55 PM;I remember his motivation because that was actually something that related to the party members in a fashion;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:55 PM;"As I said, I remember Zemus";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:55 PM;He didn't have anything to him;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:55 PM;His motivation also played some part in expanding the background of Cecil and Golbez.;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:55 PM;There is a reason why Golbez was chosen to be in the logo for the remake;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:56 PM;Golbez' art was chosen because like you said he was there most of the game and it makes you think he's the big bad;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;Zemus literally manipulated Golbez psychically;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;in order to do what;;
Malfred#1000;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;Yes;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;golbez is more compelling as a character in general n the ds version;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;i'm 99% sure they had added scenes.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;and better dialog;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:57 PM;"should be true for all remakes, hopefully";;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:58 PM;anyway Zemus wanted the world to be ruled by Lunarians.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:58 PM;do you expect a genius psychic space alien to have much personality;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:58 PM;or would he just be cold and calculating and get the job done;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 04:58 PM;maybe I'm seeing why Kefka is so well liked;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 04:59 PM;"I really don't see what there is to defend for the classic villians. Chaos, The Emperor, Cloud of Darkness, and Zemus are just there to be villians nothing more";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:00 PM;"That's like calling Bowser a compelling villian. (In the platforming games not the RPG games, he has quite a presonality in those)";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:00 PM;I agree;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:01 PM;I do gotta say though that I like the personalities they gave CoD and Mateus in Dissidia.;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:01 PM;True;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:03 PM;"Dissidia NT is going to have a campaign, right?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Oct-17 05:03 PM;"yes, that's why they delayed the PS4 version until now";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Oct-17 05:04 PM;I'm alittle let down that the gameplay isn't as good as the originals though;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:05 PM;My favorite part about Dissidia is seeing these character interact;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:05 PM;It really makes me fanboy;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 05:17 PM;I'm sad that they changed Bartz' design though;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 05:18 PM;but at least they kept his original as an optional outfit;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:19 PM;"most of the dissidia designs are based off of, or a combination of, amano's designs";;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:19 PM;squall for example;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;is a combination of nomura + amano;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;sephiroth is straight up his amano design;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;same for the protagonists of 1 through 5;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;Terra is another example of pure amano;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;1 thru 6;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;is terra pure amano?;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:20 PM;i thought amanos design was the blonde haired terra;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:21 PM;im always unsure;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:21 PM;it is;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:21 PM;which is also the dissidia design.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:25 PM;oh yeah;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:25 PM;green haired terra is an alt costume;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:26 PM;I think a big reason they went with the amano designs is that either they were the primary designs already or were too plain.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;i really dont know their reasoning;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;cloud is just nomura;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;i think zidane also?;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;but every other hero has their original amano design;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;except for squall who has a mixture of both for whatever reason;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;vaan does not count;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;"yuna, tifa.";;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:27 PM;almost every character from ffvii to ffx (idk about onwards) is Nomura I believe;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;they don't have their amano looks.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;yeah.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;they do;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;but as alt costumes;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;They do but as alt costumes;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;same as terra;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;So it isn't exactly the same;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;They became less renesance and more anime;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;evil clous from duodecim is amanos design;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;cloud*;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;tank top squall as well;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:28 PM;Yuna is still very classical either way.;;

mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:30 PM;his art looks good but very weird;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:30 PM;i honestly prefer nomura's style;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:30 PM;His art is great but his people look deformed.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:30 PM;(not designs);;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:31 PM;I think Amano's art looks like old paintings from Rome;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:31 PM;that's what I like about it;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:31 PM;it's so unconventional and different;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:31 PM;Plus have you seen his work on Vampire Hunter D?;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:32 PM;"I think I prefer Amano's stuff, but Nomura's Dissidia portraits are gorgeous";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:32 PM;That is has more clean less painting look to it;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:32 PM;I saw his stuff in a WOlverine/Elektra ogn a while back and was like;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:32 PM;eh;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:32 PM;I think it's fine for still life portraits.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;his designs are pretty unique and cool;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;but god his style is weird;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;like have you seen Squall's official amano art;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;I like weird;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;shits ugly;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;"I disagree, but I suppose I can see why you think so";;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;it's the eyes;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 05:33 PM;its the everything;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:34 PM;I disagree as well but the eyes put me off a little.;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:34 PM;He draws his characters very feminely like they are gods and godesses;;

Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:36 PM;"I think Nomura is good but I wouldn't call it unique, his designs are great but it's not exactly that different from any other anime/manga art";;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:37 PM;"though as much as I love Nomura's Dissidia pictures, Squall's is very off. that face";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:37 PM;I don't really like any of the Kingdom Hearts redesigns for the FF characters;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:37 PM;I like Yuffikku.;;

Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:42 PM;I never uderstood why they would make characters named so similarly to FF character;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:42 PM;Riku and Terra;;

Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:44 PM;"also, in the process of searching I got fucking spoiled on Persona 5 lmao. a boss name I should not be hearing. goddammit lol.";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;yes that's exactly it lime.;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;I'm sorry Seymour;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;clamp as RIDICULOUSLY weird anatomy.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;has.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;it's kids are fine though curiously.;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;(nah it's my fault);;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:45 PM;I think it's bad on purpose;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 05:46 PM;"that particular show and picture is bad on purpose, I think. but some of the stuff on the well renowed and popular series Code Geass i'm not a huge fan of. I don't like the lankyness it looks absurd to me.";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:46 PM;"Yeah, makes sense";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:46 PM;It's worse with some shows than others.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:47 PM;Like it's not that bad in say Tsubasa;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:47 PM;And it's practically nonexistent in CardCaptor Sakura;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:47 PM;But then you get to XXXholic and Code Geass;;

Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:48 PM;.... Lord.............;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:48 PM;I feel like the anatomy for that is actually fine but they caught it at a bad frame;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:48 PM;Maybe...;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:49 PM;but why is her stomach dipping in so much under the breasts;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:49 PM;it's meant to be her ribcage.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:49 PM;in a mid-frame.;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:50 PM;That's what I figured but rib cages end a bit closer to the hips;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 05:50 PM;"Probably, still weird none the less";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:50 PM;yea;;

Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 05:53 PM;in like all three primary servers.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;So I haven't done any research yet but is anyone aware of story changes to FF7 in the Remake?;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;i dont think those were mentioned yet;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;I hope they include all the new stuff since it should be canon;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;please no;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;keep compilation shit out of it;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;like;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;develop more on zack or something;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;Lol a friend of mine feels the same as you but I don't get it;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:06 PM;but please keep genesis out;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;also forget AC exists;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;this is BEFORE ac;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;it should not be taken into account;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;Crisis Core was good;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;All we know is that Midgar will be fully explorable in the first game.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;It humanized Sephiroth;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;Hmmm;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:07 PM;Wait so this is totally different;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;well yes;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;I expect thing from the compilarion as well as cut content to be added over the course of however many titles it will be.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;it's a remake;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;i wanna go to a bar in Midgar and hear MwtMG;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;just please;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;pleeeease;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;I wanna see Red XIII's story extrapolated on.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;don't cut crossdressing cloud threatening to cut corneos balls off;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;Specifically bring back the cut members of his species.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;Oh they aren't.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;Crossdressing Cloud has been said to still be in already.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:08 PM;you know what would be cool?;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;Didn't they at least confirm everything in the original story would be there;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;a playable segment with Seto;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;detailing the Nattak raid;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;"I doubt everything in the original story will be there, at least in the same form.";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;It's multiple different games so everything will be more spread out and some things will be changed.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;I remember reading about it a year ago;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;They said no new stories will be added;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;However;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;there will be new shit;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:09 PM;be sure of it;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;Yeah that's basically a lie.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;"That may mean Crisis Core and all is not new, and is included";;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;there's no way the game will not have any new or cut content.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;"or, games.";;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;I think they meant main plots;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;because they have to fill more than one game.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;That's the problem with translating;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;FFVII as it is isn't lengthy enough for that.;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;include more development based on what we saw in CC;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;just ignore genesis;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;I like genesis;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:10 PM;terrible taste;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;genesis is that charcter right? or is it a media;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;Also there is an eerie similarity between Genesis/Sephiroth and Sora/Riku;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;that character;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;red coat guy;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;Same color schemes;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;muh gift of the goddess;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;well;;
mezzs#6465;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;muh loveless;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;riku's color scheme is really white/black/yellow;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;the yellow is important.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;I mean;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:11 PM;Same hair and eye color;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:12 PM;And Sora has red and black like genesis for his new outfit;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:12 PM;I can see them including FFVII and AC as playable entries and Crisis Core flashbacks.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:12 PM;Makes me think hmmmm;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:12 PM;Like the first two games could be VII vanilla then the third is AC.;;
Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:12 PM;That is absolutely something I can see them doing.;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:12 PM;Hard to say;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:13 PM;Most players will be too young to be overly nostalgic;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:13 PM;Therefore;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:13 PM;New stuff is good;;
IxTiger#8704;20-Oct-17 06:13 PM;Marketing;;
Seymour#0747;20-Oct-17 06:13 PM;my first exposure to Final Fantasy was some Advent Children marketing;;

Treble#5035;20-Oct-17 06:20 PM;i have no strict feelings towards genesis but at least it gives us a reason for LOVELESS;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;20-Oct-17 06:24 PM;Aren't they typically picky about filesize?;;

Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 06:28 PM;Wind Waker Link said a few phrases;;

Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 06:34 PM;Didn't Link's voice actor voice a character in Gurren Lagann?;;

Davkilla101#0932;20-Oct-17 06:39 PM;Yeah...;;
Davkilla101#0932;20-Oct-17 06:40 PM;I think the CDI games are one of the main reasons we don't have actual voice actor for link;;

Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 06:40 PM;I think it's more beacuse we have that was Miyamoto's invision;;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 06:41 PM;He wanted us to be Link;;
Davkilla101#0932;20-Oct-17 06:41 PM;"That's the main reason, but the CDI games probably helped his argument for a silent Link";;
Lime#6560;20-Oct-17 06:42 PM;True;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 05:59 PM;he was dealt a bad hand;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:06 PM;the whole mind-control and betrayal thing in FFIV's universe is really annoying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:06 PM;probably the worst part about the plot for both the original and TAY;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:08 PM;"I mean I guess, but I mean IV has a pretty simple plot and I don't think it provides enough opportunities to connect to these characters for a betrayal to carry any weight";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:14 PM;IV seems like they were experimenting;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:15 PM;like what they can get away with;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:15 PM;Wasn't there added dialogue in the remakes?;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:15 PM;of II that is;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:15 PM;well II's GBA/PSP remasters added an entire extra story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:16 PM;I don't remember if there's any extra dialogue in the main game though;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:18 PM;"I know about the extra scenes, but I would imagine they would've fleshed out the dialouge at the very least";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:19 PM;they probably didn't feel the need at the time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:19 PM;SoR in itself felt like padding anyway;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:19 PM;so I definitely wouldn't want the story to be padded in the main game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:20 PM;they would have to rewrite it all tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:20 PM;that's how you fix FFII;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:21 PM;It would take a lot more than that to fix FFII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:21 PM;I was speaking on story alone;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:21 PM;II needs an entire rework from the ground up if you count all aspects of the game;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:22 PM;"Unless it was a fan project, I wouldn't want Square to invest in that";;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:23 PM;V and VI need propper remakes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:26 PM;tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:26 PM;fans would probably be able to get all 3 done;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:26 PM;before Square ever starts one;;

Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:28 PM;"They would, but I think VI desrves treatment more suited to what VII is recieving(aside from the multiple games part), which fans couldn't exactly provide";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:28 PM;they could technically;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:28 PM;you just need the right team;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:28 PM;but at the same time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:28 PM;a remake of either scale would be shot down anyway;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 06:29 PM;I was joking around;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 06:30 PM;remember when the Crimson Echoes team said they got C&D'd but then it turned out to probably be fake because ZeaLity's a little bitch?;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:30 PM;Crimson Echoes released;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 06:30 PM;not really;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 06:30 PM;it released at 98% complete;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 06:30 PM;that's not a full release;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;21-Oct-17 06:31 PM;there's also Flames of Eternity but I don't count that;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:31 PM;Some fan games that get the C&D come out anyway;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:31 PM;Like AM2R;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:31 PM;but then again that was after it released;;
Lime#6560;21-Oct-17 06:31 PM;when it got taken down;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:32 PM;"oh what was that one game, that the devs of Geometry Wars got salty about and sent a C&D for";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:33 PM;all because the game was more popular lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Oct-17 06:33 PM;I would say that the guy in charge of that project would've went to court for that claim but he definitely doesn't have the money to win;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;21-Oct-17 06:35 PM;AM2R is one of my favorite Metroids.;;

mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 02:18 PM;no it's actually エアリス which can mean both;;

mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 02:20 PM;I like Aerith better;;
mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 02:21 PM;but Aeris is easier to say;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 02:26 PM;I like Aerith better and find it pretty easy to say;;
Davkilla101#0932;22-Oct-17 02:29 PM;I like Aerith as well. It's actually easier for me to say than Aeris;;
Malfred#1000;22-Oct-17 02:31 PM;I prefer Aeris;;
Malfred#1000;22-Oct-17 02:31 PM;As should be pretty obvious.;;
Seymour#0747;22-Oct-17 02:31 PM;(I prefer Aerith). I believe Aerith is the original name and Aeris was the NA translation or something like that;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Oct-17 02:32 PM;"I alternate between Aerith and Aeris, sometimes even in the same sentence";;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 02:34 PM;Yeah Aeris is a translation error;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 02:34 PM;Of Aerisu;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 02:34 PM;Which is how Aerith is romanized and pronounced in Japanese;;

mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 03:03 PM;uh no;;
mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 03:03 PM;Aeris is also romanized as Earisu;;
mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 03:03 PM;both Aerith and Aeris are Earisu in katakana;;
mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 03:03 PM;literally spelled the same;;
mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 03:03 PM;エアリス;;
mezzs#6465;22-Oct-17 03:03 PM;the argument is that her name is meant to be the same as Earth;;

Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 09:59 PM;yeah you'd still be a bit underleveled then;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 09:59 PM;which version of iv?;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 09:59 PM;PSP;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;hit lvl 50 or 55 if u want easy grinding;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;then once u hit 70+ u might beat him;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;if you want a challenge go at like 45..;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;hmm yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;u should use golden apples or silver;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;is moon the final dungeon already? 🤔;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;i heard that;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;if u go to the moon;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;ohhh!;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;u cant go back to earth;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;i think;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;well the moon is _multiple_ dungeons;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;and you can i think;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;"well, you can";;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;ohh yeah;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:00 PM;i have the Whale airship;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:01 PM;i really cant remember xD;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:01 PM;and you just have to walk to the crystal;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:01 PM;but i havent seen the Giant of Babil yet;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:01 PM;you should fight it if you want shurikens;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:01 PM;You also get party swapping soon enough I think;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:01 PM;yeeah.;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;So if you don't wanna use say Rosa you can use Porom;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;yep;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;however it might be hard to grind them up though;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;yeah it would take a minute but i think for the twins it's worth it;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;they turn into the strongest black and white mages in the game;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;i think;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:02 PM;yeah;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;wait let me see how to reach giant of Babil;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;i heard porom can learn holy at 50+?;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;yea i think;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;while rosa at 60+;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;wow;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;and it stays the same in TAY.;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;the twins are better than i thought lol;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;but i prefer the ff4 band;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;and rydia;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;I MUST KEEP;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;because i love her summons;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:03 PM;Rydia has a special place in my heart;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:04 PM;i tended to replace edge and rosa with palom and porom;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:04 PM;but if Zeromus is that hard i might go;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:04 PM;double black is worth it;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:04 PM;Cecil-Kain-Palom-Porom-Yang/Rydia;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:04 PM;I'd say Rydia is worth it because of summons and double black;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:04 PM;But that's just me.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:05 PM;well i would take two black mages aswell if thats the case;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:05 PM;Twincast can be REAL useful too;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:06 PM;Yeeeeeee;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:06 PM;i love Twincast so much ❤;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:06 PM;So yeah I think it's worth it to have the twins at endgame regardless;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:06 PM;The canon band is good too tho;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:07 PM;also as an aside adult porom has my favorite white mage design probably;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:07 PM;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/f/f0/TAY_Porom.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/231?cb=20121024073454;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:08 PM;yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:08 PM;full pink;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:08 PM;however if u want a really good challenge to fight the creator;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:08 PM;use leonora;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:09 PM;i tend to do ceodore - ursula - rydia - palom - porom;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:09 PM;i thought about using all new characters at one point too;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:09 PM;yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:09 PM;its the kids generation now;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:09 PM;_you get it_ lmao;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:10 PM;"my rationale for rydia is that she's like, the mentor but she is still only 24 so.";;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:10 PM;xD;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:11 PM;i guess theoretically you can replace her with leonora though.;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:11 PM;but i gotta have my summons;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:12 PM;xD;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:13 PM;Rydia is 24 in TAY? But how old is she at IV when she returns from the Passage of the Eidolons? 🤔;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:14 PM;16;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:14 PM;she presumably doesn't age until her chronological age matches her physical age.;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:14 PM;so she ages 8 years in 15;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:15 PM;yeah;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:15 PM;ah its like an aging hiatus;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:15 PM;ALSOO;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;if you're gonna play tay in psp;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;u might see references to other games;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;like for example..;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;well after consulting a guide i have yet to find fusoya and the giant of babil before facing the endgame;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;i mean i'm not gonna say not to play TAY PSP;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;gilgamesh;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;but also;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:16 PM;I wouldn't if given a choice;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:17 PM;"im not feeling like playing TAY, it will depend on when i end the game though";;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:18 PM;i would wait;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:18 PM;at least play one other game before trying tay;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:18 PM;"Everyone should be at level 60 at the very least. When Fusoya is found, he'll likely be at level 50. , , tfw my characters are still Lv.40 :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;lvl 60 above;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;then if u get fusoya;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;grind a bit to 69 or above;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;"i will wait,  i want to see if i play II or X after this";;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;i started a new 3 playthrough today;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:19 PM;"damnit IV was doing so good, why did its late game got so grindy";;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:20 PM;eh.;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:20 PM;it isn't as grindy as some other games that dedicate their last discs entirely to endgame grinding;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:20 PM;yeah;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:20 PM;grinding will be easier in TAY;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:21 PM;in the meantime;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:21 PM;where should i go to Lvl up?;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:21 PM;like i have a long way to go;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:21 PM;before going for Fusoya and the giant;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:21 PM;i would do it on the moon;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:21 PM;but takes lots of pots and phoenix downs just in case.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:22 PM;"and i didnt got Yang Back, slyphs just gave their summon";;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:22 PM;ohh;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:22 PM;"i know Yang, the Twins, Edward (even i dont care about him) will rejoin later)";;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:22 PM;hmm maybe try talking to shiella now;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:22 PM;she might give u knife;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:22 PM;casually i was going to fabul now;;

Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:24 PM;(but it's actually canon there);;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:24 PM;That's why I say to wait to play TAY;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:24 PM;I mean that;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:24 PM;they will use the same thing to wake up yang;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:24 PM;and ursula;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:24 PM;yea;;

Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:28 PM;wait;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:28 PM;are you sure TAY isnt the same IV game? 🤔;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:28 PM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:28 PM;it's different enough;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:29 PM;it just revisits a lot of the same stuff and reuses resources.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:30 PM;mmmmm;;
its hiiiiigh n00t🐧#7866;22-Oct-17 10:30 PM;it has new mechanics btw;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:31 PM;and there _are_ certain bits of it that are 100% fresh;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:31 PM;like when leonora's story;;
Treble#5035;22-Oct-17 10:31 PM;that when shouldn't be there.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;22-Oct-17 10:37 PM;moon enemies hit hard but they arent that hard to take down;;

Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:21 AM;Substantially better writing for one.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:21 AM;"I don't dislike VII, even if it isn't near a favorite, but when compared to a better game like IX it massively pales in comparison.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:21 AM;VII tried to be more epic and edgy of lack of better terms;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:21 AM;-looks at cloud's hair-;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:21 AM;I guess IX was more relatable;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;Also I think FF often is at it's best when it's not so... modern.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;Or futuristic for that matter.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;^;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;Well a futuristic setting could work;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;Just;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;Some of the best entries are all based in the past;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;Actually now that you bring that up;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;"IV, V, VI, IX, X, XII";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:22 AM;X is the past?;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:23 AM;It looks futuristic;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:23 AM;Sorta.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:23 AM;X is hard to place because most of the world is based on feudal era Japan;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:23 AM;But then there's futuristic technology and it's a post apocalypse.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:23 AM;It's a weird hybrid;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:23 AM;From here you were you didn't get to the main setting of the game.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:24 AM;where*;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:24 AM;So all you saw was the semi-futuristic setting that was Zanarkand;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:24 AM;I also remember Wakka being just some doofus. I didn't stand him;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:24 AM;When you get to the main game all of that is destroyed except for maybe two cities.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:24 AM;"Oh, you might've gotten to Luca then.";;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:24 AM;Wakka kind of is a racist asshat through most of the game.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:25 AM;I also hated him in Kingdom Hearts;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:25 AM;I played some of KH and talking to Wakka was not fun;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:25 AM;I'm gonna say only two and a half cities remain futuristic in X's present day;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:25 AM;"Luca, Home, and Bevelle plays halfsies.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:25 AM;Let me check if I have a bit of change to buy the game;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:26 AM;I have $30 and the game is $25;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:26 AM;🤔;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:27 AM;I mean it's up to you but if you need that $30 for food... lol.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:27 AM;I'm still in high school so food isn't that big of an issue unless I have a case of munchies;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:28 AM;I'm also getting a new job soon so maybe it won't be that bad;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:28 AM;I could grind it back;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:28 AM;I'm buying this weird game again;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:28 AM;ahaha;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:28 AM;And be less mean to the laughy man;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:28 AM;Just keep in mind when you get to _that_ part that it's supposed to be forced.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:29 AM;I just remembered a guy redid the FFX soundtrack with Tidus's laugh;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:29 AM;What a lad;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:29 AM;ye;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:30 AM;I did bust $20 on art supplies today;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:30 AM;Who cares;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:30 AM;I want more FF;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:30 AM;Also don't be like that one guy that crossed Tidus' sphere grid over into Lulu's;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:30 AM;Save yourself some hassle and cross him into Auron's;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:31 AM;wait what;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:31 AM;Eventually characters get access to other character's sphere grids;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:31 AM;You can technically go all over each grid with each character;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:31 AM;You want to pick where you send them first tho and Tidus becomes ass near endgame unless you send into a physical-based grid;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:32 AM;Which means Auron;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:32 AM;Thanks for the tip;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:32 AM;I think that why my friend couldn't beat the final boss;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:33 AM;He says he's stuck there and can't beat it;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:33 AM;And gave up;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:33 AM;wait what? THe final boss is a pushover;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:33 AM;probably means BFA;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:33 AM;but also: anima;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:34 AM;Still a pushover;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:34 AM;if you're underleveled and managed to get past bfa pain can fuck you up is all i mean;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:34 AM;"I mean, I've always found BFA to be a pushover";;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:34 AM;i cheated and beat the aeons with other aeons until only valefor was left;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:34 AM;that really isn't cheating;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:35 AM;Btw. @Treble#5035 How did Kuja's fight treat you;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:35 AM;Both forms;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:35 AM;"I mean I've played it multiple times and while I barely remember my first, the past few times I did it I didn't have too much trouble.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:35 AM;Maybe I did something wrong;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:35 AM;I had trouble with the four fiends when I was a kid though so I'm sure that Kuja was a royal pain the first time I played.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:36 AM;Nah I just already knew what I was doing when I played it as a teenager and adult.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:36 AM;The first time I played it I was about eleven years old.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:36 AM;I was ready to kill myself facing him;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:37 AM;The only thing I remember about my first playthrough of 9 was that my brother was shocked how quickly I had gotten to Terra;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:37 AM;Lmao;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:37 AM;The main thing I remember from my first playthrough was fighting Marilith in Memoria;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:37 AM;And getting fucked up;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:38 AM;Oh god the bosses before Kuja were ass;;
Seymour#0747;29-Oct-17 01:38 AM;imo BFA is the hardest boss. that cleave attack in the 2nd phase is just bs. similar to supernova or w/e in ff8.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:38 AM;Ok idk how to feel about the icon for FFX on PS4;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:38 AM;isn't it just the logo;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:39 AM;also: it was mustard bomb that kept messing me up;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:39 AM;VII and IX are clean white but X is grey;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/374084797649387520/image.jpg;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:39 AM;Oh yeah;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;"Speaking of Mustard Bomb, it  took me a while to realize, the insta death happened if the  character attacked";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;What?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;ye;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;That's about the Marilith fight lol;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;I didn't catch that.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;WHAT;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;THATS HOW DEATH IS AVOIDED?!;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;DONT ATTACK?!;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;yep;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/d/db/Original_FFX_logo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130202062814;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;i um;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:40 AM;i prefer this logo for ffx?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;uh what;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;"oh, the *original* logo";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;*all I had to do was not attack*;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;i mean i like the one they used;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;*n o t  a t t a c k*;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;but this is real pretty?;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;The old one seems to plain;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:41 AM;At least this one I can tell what it's supposed to be;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:42 AM;You say that but IX has the plainest logo in the series.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:42 AM;Old one is too plane but current one is too wild;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:42 AM;Maybe I don't like the logos where they show the main character like in VIII and I guess X. VI did it better since it showed the magitec armor;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:43 AM;And not Terra's face;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:43 AM;It probably would have been TOO obvious that X revolved around Yuna if they had went with the old logo.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:43 AM;"I'm reading about the development process and apparently that was always the intention, to revolve around yuna.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:44 AM;My fave logos are the ones that just show an object like in VII and IX. at first glance you don't know what they mean until you see it;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:44 AM;Whereas Tidus was a PoV character.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:44 AM;I didn't know what meteorite was when I saw VII;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;"And idk why. People don't appreciate how fucking great the main menu of VII is. Say what you want about the game, the title screen stuck on to for so long";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;Just the lone buster sword;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;https://youtu.be/K3szNg0_KRc;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;I love that;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;Yeah it was nice and simplistic.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;Ima look at it again;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;It's so cool;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;"The original concept of Final Fantasy X story was that a person would reach the end of life at 17 years of age. That theme of inevitable death was carried over to become Yuna's fate.[10] In Final Fantasy X Ultimania Omega creators' interview, it is mentioned one of the early the premises was having a deadly illness running rampant in the world with Yuna as a nurse following Yevon's teachings treating people while on a pilgrimage. Yevon was a Red Cross-like organization with Mika as its chairman. Yuna would have failed to heal the people and it would turn out that the method of treatment itself was leading to the people's deaths.";;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:45 AM;This would've been cool;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;FFX changed _a lot_ during the development process;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;Must've been through development hell;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;Like XV;;
Seymour#0747;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;i think V had the plainest logo imo;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;can we get a list of all the logos;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;X had basically no development hell;;
Seymour#0747;29-Oct-17 01:46 AM;but I haven't played V so idk the significance of a dragon;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:47 AM;X came out at a time that was basically a series rennaissance;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:47 AM;With three titles being developed and released back to back to back.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:47 AM;;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/374086914753429505/image.jpg;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:48 AM;Don't wanna fanboy but VII and IX had the nicest logos;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:48 AM;Simplicity beats complexity any day;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:48 AM;I think the dragon on V's is supposed to reflect a certain important plot point;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:49 AM;All the logos convey that;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:49 AM;I like Cocoon on XIII's logo too;;
Seymour#0747;29-Oct-17 01:49 AM;i think i like VI's logo the most;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:49 AM;Just some logos do it better than others;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;I don't understand Advent children;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;Lenna's Wind Drake saves the party's life multiple times and eventually becomes Phoenix.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;Is why he's the logo.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;Like what's with the logo with Advent Children;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;It's not a meteor so what is it;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;it is the meteor;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;it's literally just vii's logo.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:50 AM;But;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:51 AM;The meteor is not relevant in the movie;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:51 AM;it's just saying;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:51 AM;this is a movie sequel to final fantasy 7;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:51 AM;Could've used the bustersword as the logo but this works I guess;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:51 AM;Actually;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:51 AM;Crisis core should've had that as the logo;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:52 AM;actually V's logo may be Syldra;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:52 AM;Lmao I just remembered how Cloud got his name;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:52 AM;but it's probably hiryu;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:52 AM;My mom wanted me to shoot for the stars but figured I'd only get half way;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:52 AM;I haven't played V so idk;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:53 AM;Bartz seems cool;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:53 AM;I like TAY's logo a lot too;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:53 AM;it's really cute and simplistic;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:53 AM;Yeah it's Hiryu in V's.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:54 AM;Also;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:54 AM;Idk if it's just me;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:54 AM;Squall sorda has a cave man look in the logo;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:54 AM;His face;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:54 AM;he has amano face lol.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;He doesn't look depressed;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;He more like;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;Me like woman. Me like friends;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;Me want food;;
Seymour#0747;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;I haven't played 13 but the logo reminds me of a doctor logo with the spirals;;

Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;Shit this is pretty;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:55 AM;Oooo;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:56 AM;13's logo is technically ending spoilers once you've played the game and know what it is.;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:56 AM;What if VII had Aerith as the logo. Would it still be as good?;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:56 AM;She's pretty damn important.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:57 AM;Unless it's her death scene it wouldn't be the same lol.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:57 AM;XIII's logo is very explicitly the literal ending.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:57 AM;I won't go indepth unless you guys dgaf;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:57 AM;Idc. I don't plan playing XIII;;

Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:58 AM;that and Tactics Advanced are FF games I won't revisit;;
Seymour#0747;29-Oct-17 01:58 AM;(idc either);;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:59 AM;"The game features a prophecy that the main characters of the game will destroy one of the two worlds, Cocoon.";;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:59 AM;"If they don't destroy Cocoon they will all turn into ci'eth, zombie-like creatures.";;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:59 AM;Technically they succeed.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:00 AM;"The logo depicts two of the games characters, Vanille and Fang, turning into the eidolon Ragnarok and destroying cocoon... by turning it to crystal.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:00 AM;What a fucking logo;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:01 AM;Cocoon spends the ending of XIII and entirety of XIII-2 in this crystal form.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:02 AM;"But manages not to be devoid of life or to crash into the other world, Gran Pulse.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:02 AM;Do you think there could've been a better logo to choose?;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:03 AM;Sort of.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:03 AM;They could have just went with the same logo sans Vanille and Fang.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:03 AM;Because then it could have just been Cocoon or;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:03 AM;Why not just show the antagonist;;

Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:04 AM;Which is Serah's engagement pendant;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:04 AM;This seems like a better choice of a logo;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:04 AM;Serah being one of two reasons the entire game happens in the first plae.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:04 AM;place*;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:05 AM;Lightning's crystarium would have worked too;;

Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:05 AM;That would seem too similar to IX since IX is also a rock;;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:06 AM;And VII being a bigger rock;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:06 AM;"The difference is that this would look like a rose when drawn, probably.";;
Dashboard#0598;29-Oct-17 01:06 AM;We have enough rocks;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:06 AM;Since that's what it's supposed to be;;

Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:06 AM;Lightning's eidolith is a rose.;;
Treble#5035;29-Oct-17 01:06 AM;lol.;;

Dashboard#0598;30-Oct-17 10:17 AM;IX and X being hated might be a good thing;;
Dashboard#0598;30-Oct-17 10:18 AM;people get to play those games blindly and not know much unlike with VII where the good parts are spoiled;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 11:11 AM;"I think it's more that FFVII is very overhyped, rather than the other two are hated.";;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 11:11 AM;"But yeah, great point!";;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 11:11 AM;"I went into both spoiler free, but I was spoiled for FFVII";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:08 PM;I mean they aren't hated.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:08 PM;They just aren't massively overhyped like VII is.;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:13 PM;Exactly. They tend to be in people's top three FF games;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:15 PM;"It helps that the most popular scene in FFX, probably the third most hyped FF, isn't _that_ spoilery if you already know that there's a romance.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:15 PM;Because it's the spring scene.;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:15 PM;"That's pretty much one of the, if not *the*, defining scene for FFX";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:16 PM;It absolutely is the defining scene.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:16 PM;It also doesn't spoil the plot very much.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:16 PM;Compared to FFVII's most famous scene _literally being the twist at the end of the first disc_ with Aerith dying.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:16 PM;There's no avoiding spoilers with VII because of that.;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:17 PM;"Exactly, everyone knows FFVII comes with a huge plot twist, and it's kind of hard to disguise it after a certain point.";;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:18 PM;"That said, I can't think of a truly iconic FFIX scene off the top of my head. Perhaps with Vivi and Black Waltz 3, but that's not strictly spoilery.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:19 PM;The iconic scene from IX is Dagger's Mulan moment.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:19 PM;"... which, again, isn't spoilery.";;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:20 PM;"See while iconic, I wouldn't put it up there with the underwater scene and Aerith being killed. It's a wonderful scene, but not quite on the same level.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:20 PM;"Yeah, I agree, it's just the scene that you most often see when it's related with FFIX.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:21 PM;FFIX is a good game on the whole but because of that there's no one singular scene that stands out.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:21 PM;"A few come close, like that, Vivi and Black Waltz, and the summoning of Alexander.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:21 PM;But nothing quite compares.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:21 PM;Even VIII has the space walk.;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:22 PM;"I wonder if that's why I like FFIX so much. There's no 'one' scene, there's lots of smaller ones instead. I mean my favourite is the 'You're not Alone' part.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:23 PM;IX is just incredibly solid is what it is.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:23 PM;"It's not just a good Final Fantasy, it's a good video game.";;

fine and dandy#9438;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;Well to be fair vivi never died because he was never alive.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;He FINALLY realizes he doesn't have to be a monster;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;... but he's got an expiration date.;;
fine and dandy#9438;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;And does this mean the kids will live to be a normal age?;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;"Kuja's death is pretty well done, too.";;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;He survives the Iifa Tree;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;And then dies later.;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:41 PM;I hope so. I like to think that Vivi and the rest found a way for the new black mages to have a proper lifespan;;

fine and dandy#9438;30-Oct-17 02:49 PM;Oh God.;;

Dashboard#0598;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;maybe he did.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;again i wasn't saying that quina had the kids;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;just that;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;vivi and quina were married;;
Dashboard#0598;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;oh shit they were;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;in today's society that'd mean that quina would be a step-parent;;
Aruu#2066;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;I think that's an actually really cute idea;;
fine and dandy#9438;30-Oct-17 02:50 PM;Huh. No man's sky is only 23$.;;

Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:52 PM;From the same tribe;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:52 PM;Which is honestly why I like the idea of Quina parenting Vivi's kids.;;

Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 02:54 PM;where the airship drops you;;
Dashboard#0598;30-Oct-17 02:54 PM;one orb gave the option to teleport to the beginning;;

Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 03:01 PM;you should have at least one ranged unit just in case.;;

Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 03:12 PM;Oh yes.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 03:12 PM;But that's nothing that can't be fixed.;;
Treble#5035;30-Oct-17 03:12 PM;It's an error to do with having a shoddy antagonist.;;

Dashboard#0598;30-Oct-17 03:13 PM;i dont think its nostalgia blocking me from being serious since i didnt play FF as a kid;;

Falcatox#0275;02-Nov-17 01:44 PM;Jeez;;
Falcatox#0275;02-Nov-17 01:44 PM;@Sr. Barista#0413 what levels are you?;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:37 PM;No no! I took the picture while the sprite was desintegrating;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:38 PM;"I couldnt keep up with so much Big Bangs/Flares, so eventuslly everyone died, i arised Rydia cause i needed heavy damage";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 02:38 PM;It does look poorly photoshopped in;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 02:39 PM;"But still, what levels where you?";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:39 PM;"I casted Megaflare one last time saying Rydia, i dont expect you to kill it, but i really hope you can D:";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:39 PM;"Edge was 53, Rydia and Kain 54, Cecil and Rosa 55";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:41 PM;Yeah you were at least ten levels behind what I'd suggest lol.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 02:43 PM;"If you think that's sphincter tightening, good luck with the 3D version";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:46 PM;I realized that it was waaaaay easier in PSP;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:47 PM;"And least i had to be Lv.60 so i wouldnt have that much of a hard time, But i tried one more time at Lv.55 and stuff happened!";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:48 PM;"@Treble#5035 you recommended me levels for the DS difficulty, but still it helped me a lot to make the endgame easier";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:48 PM;"@Psychotic Ninja#0661 i dont replay games, i already know IV is harder";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:48 PM;for ds i'd say 60s is the lower limit;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:48 PM;for psp/etc it's just to make it... sorta not hard at all;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:49 PM;are you going back and using other party members at all?;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:52 PM;"reason i was tense during the boss fight it was not because i found it hard, it was because i was afraid of Rosa not casting Curaja when Zeromus started to shake";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:52 PM;And of course because i was really close to losing the fight;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:53 PM;"I saw a video of the battle in DS, the guy that recorded it was Lv.79 in almost every character";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:54 PM;"Im not sure, Dungeon is kinda long and i would have to restart it, i played the final boss in a spare time i had in the morning, because university is keeping me really busy";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:55 PM;"there are post-game dungeons unlocked for the twins, edward, yang, and cid.";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:55 PM;if you really want to do them;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:55 PM;but it's unnecessary.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:55 PM;Oh i know about that! The Mount Ordeals thing;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:56 PM;"And the Super Bosses, But the preparation time to take down a Superboss = Time playing an FF i havent completed yet :HAHAHAHAHA:";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:56 PM;Something to note is that certain party members that you don't have for the primary endgame team are better than the actual final party members.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:56 PM;Notably Porom and Rosa.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 02:57 PM;"Yep, i heard Porom learns Holy 10 levels earlier before Rosa do";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:58 PM;And her magic stat is substantially lower.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:58 PM;Strength is lower;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:58 PM;but who is using a white mage for their strenth?;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 02:58 PM;strength*;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:03 PM;"Wait, Rosa's Magic stat is lower? or its Porom's?";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:04 PM;Rosa's is.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:04 PM;"Porom's strength is lower than Rosa's, Porom's magic is higher than Rosa's.";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:12 PM;i knew that for some reason i had to bring porom instead of rosa;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:12 PM;but if i brought porom;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:13 PM;Lots of grinding?;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:13 PM;wouldn't have hurt you either way 😛;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:13 PM;"i couldnt use Twincast without Palom, and to bring Palom i would have to lay off Edge/Rydia/Kain, and after buying a bunch of shurikens, grinding the strongest Eidolons, and simply likin' Kain's Jump waaay too much made me go with the canon party";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:14 PM;twincast is unnecessary even if it is the twins' unique skill.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:14 PM;(though i will also say that the double black power of having palom and rydia helps a LOT against zeromus);;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:15 PM;for that matter palom is actually stronger than rydia too;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:15 PM;magic-stat wise.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 03:21 PM;I always mix up Palom and Porom.;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:21 PM;i thought about taking the Twins instead of Rydia and Rosa;;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:21 PM;"i could leave Rosa, but not Rydia, Summons are way too strong to not use them";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:21 PM;"i thought about replacing edge/kain with Yang, but like i said";;
Sr. Barista#0413;02-Nov-17 03:21 PM;lotsa shurikens;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 03:22 PM;Just one question regarding Porom.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;I replaced Edge with Palom.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;And Rosa with Porom.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;Why the fuck is she a red head in The After Years? I've got nothing against red heads (they're my preferred choice TBH.);;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;Her hair is actually _pink_;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;Still;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;it wasn't in the original;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;"It's insinuated that due to the immense magical power that Palom and Porom have, their hair color changes.";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:23 PM;Palom has a white streak in his.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:24 PM;Because even in TAY Palom and Porom are the best maes.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:24 PM;mages*;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:37 PM;all of the kids in TAY are OP;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:37 PM;or teenagers I guess;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:38 PM;"Ceodore, Ursula have one of the strongest bands, Palom and Porom for all magic stuff";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:38 PM;"5th character is whatever you want, tbh those four could carry the entire game solo";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;those four and rydia are like;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;I'd probably give it to Rydia though;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;the dream team for me.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;yeah.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;for obvious reasons lol;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;she's the ONLY summoner;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;that and you are required to use her for one fight;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;leonora could be a beast too if you're willing to grind that much because she's a sage but;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;... nah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;and if she can't survive;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;you can't win;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;yeah i remember;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;i never had that issue;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:39 PM;I made that mistake on my first playthrough;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:40 PM;bc i mean i told you my main team.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:40 PM;xD;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:40 PM;never used Rydia after her story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:40 PM;had to spend hours getting her levels back up;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:40 PM;for one damn fight lol;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:42 PM;I also like to approach TAY as ah;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:42 PM;sort of the kids' story anyway.;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:43 PM;"Even though they really aren't I felt like Palom, Porom, Ceodore, Ursula, Leonora, Luca, and Rydia were more important than the other older characters other than KAin.";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:43 PM;(Rydia kind of is);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;they are in an indirect way;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;or something like that;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;They just feel more connected.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;The older characters mainly run a backseat kind of thing;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;"Which is probably natural for a few of them, like Ceodore being the main protagonist.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;even with Edge for example;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:45 PM;"It isn't even ALL of the main characters, it's funny.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;02-Nov-17 03:46 PM;his story is more about his group of Ninjas them himself;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:46 PM;"It's Cecil, Rosa, Cid, Edge, Edward, and Yang.";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 03:46 PM;"Porom, Palom, Rydia, and Kain are essential to the story.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Nov-17 05:28 PM;To the guy who doesn't replay games: So one and done? You don't call back?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Nov-17 05:30 PM;"not him, but I'll answer for myself, I don't replay games often myself, because I have so many games to play and only so much time to play them, not to say I wouldn't like to revisit some of them, but they're extremely low priority";;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 05:30 PM;i replay certain games;;

Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 08:43 PM;you just need to know the right grids to put characters in;;
Treble#5035;02-Nov-17 08:43 PM;"yuna is the easiest to break when you cross into lulu's grid for instance because of how high her magic gets as well as havin summons, white, and black magic";;

Seymour#0747;03-Nov-17 03:35 PM;hornless;;

Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:37 PM;I honestly thought khimari was the last one;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:37 PM;That's because Seymour implies that;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:37 PM;He was lying;;
Aruu#2066;03-Nov-17 03:37 PM;Seymour got lazy;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:38 PM;Wait was that race that everyone forgets about in X;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:38 PM;The weird amphibian people;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:38 PM;The plot for the ronso in x-2 is that their numbers are decimated and they want to do the same to the guado;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 03:39 PM;calling it here;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:39 PM;Or maybe they're sentient behemoths?;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;Same colour scheme and horns;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;I think descendants of the Ronso are more likely.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;Much more likely.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;Behemoths are sort of like bulls in most iterations;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;really big really angry really dangerous bulls that summon meteors when they die;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;Well yeah fair point;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:40 PM;Whereas both Red XIII's species and the Ronso are lion-esque felines;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:41 PM;Technically I think Khimari can cast meteor;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:41 PM;Or ultima sorry;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:41 PM;I don't think Meteor is in FFX;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:41 PM;but yeah ultima is on his grid;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:41 PM;Yeah I just realised that;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;Technically I don't think khimari has a grid does he? He branches off into everyone elses;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;I mean;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;Everyone has their own grid;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;He's at the center to iirc;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;And Ultima is at the center of _his_ grid;;
Seymour#0747;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;he has his own grid? isn't his gimmick to join Rikku's or Lulu's;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;Yeah I think that's it;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:42 PM;meaning Ultima in general is in the center of the sphere grid;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:43 PM;I concede that point;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:44 PM;@Kirby#6473 he doesn't because his son died iirc;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:44 PM;He could have helped but he was fucked up from that and just let Cindy do everything I think if Regis really needed him he could rise to the challenge;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:44 PM;also square decided they wanted cidney to be the cid;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;but didn't commit to it entirely;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;because the CID is a GIRL?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!1;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;If they committed to it entirely I'd be fine with it;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;women don't amount to anything in xv;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;But they half assed it;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;aranea comes the closest but doesn't really measure up;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;Well... Lunafreya;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;even she's basically useless and wasted;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:45 PM;and they fridge her off screen;;

Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;And aranea could have killed the whole party if she wanted during the story;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;To be honest I'd actually argue that Gentiana is the closest.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;Because she's Shiva.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;`women don't amount to anything in xv`;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;Gentiana?/;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;Well... Yeah;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;oh close save;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:46 PM;Gentiana is a badass;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:47 PM;It still isn't where it needs to be;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:47 PM;but yeah;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:47 PM;and the best Girl Iris;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:47 PM;Everyone I've talked to has said that Iris is also useless lmao;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:47 PM;Yeah she's so bad;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;as opposed to who?;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;I don't think I'd be as disappointed in the female representation in XV as I am if FF wasn't sort of known for having strong female characters.;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;At least you can argue why Cindy is there but iris is literally pointless;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;Ever since Rydia and Rosa.;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;Yuna?;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;Lulu;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;Garnet;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;*The White Mage*;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;Lightning to some extent;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;FF4 was basically the first game with decent character development and characters;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;*uhhh*;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:48 PM;which is why i said rydia and rosa;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;Oh I misread that;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;FF4 was the first game to have an acceptable Story and plot;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;3 was pretty good;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;that worked on it's own;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;"Between 4 and 15 I can't really think of a single female party member that's, well, useless.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;the first 3 games are D&D campaigns without a proper GM;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;Or bad;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:49 PM;Yeah I agree 100% treble;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;Like I can complain about how Tifa is portrayed after a certain point in 7 but that's a writing flaw not a character flaw.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;Krile doesn't do much;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;neither does Relm;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;They still aren't weak characters per se;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;Well relm is a little shit;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;And completely bugged;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;Krile picks up right where her grandpa left off and is precocious and willing to help save the world;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;Relm is probably the perennial exuberant girl;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:50 PM;none of the 13 girls would qualify except Fang maybe;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;Lightning was a badass;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;The games were meh;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;But lightning was cool imo;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;"Lightning, Fang, and Vanille were all strong characters in their own right.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;if lightning was an actual character I would be willing to let that slide;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;Is vanille not a massive racist or something;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;but she has no real development;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:51 PM;"Vanille is the same kind of strong that characters like Ashe, Yuna, Aerith, Garnet, Celes, Terra, Lenna and Rosa are.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:52 PM;none of them go through any meaningful development;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:52 PM;I mean Vanille absolutely does;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:52 PM;Vanille is kind of an asshole iirc;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:52 PM;i don't recall that;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:52 PM;Vanillie is almost the same character at the beginnig of the game till the end;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;aerith wasnt developed enough if i could be honest;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;the only thing that would have stopped that are 2 conversations;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;that never happened;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;`aerith wasnt developed enough if i could be honest`;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;I don't disagree;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;I don't think _any_ character in 7 is developed enough.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;Cloud?;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;But Aerith got a shit ton of development in just one disc.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;Barret?;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;"No, not even Cloud or Barret.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;okay;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;Well thats why it has 1 00spinoff's;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;They develop but not enough.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;I don't agree with that at all;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:53 PM;It's a writing flaw.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;And to be honest Cloud may develop;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;but;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;it's all thrown away;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;cloud does change through the game a bit;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;not a lot;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;who cloud is at the end of ff7 doesn't matter.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;neither cloud or barret are anywhere close to being the same people at the beginning of the game vs the end;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;because by the time we see him next and in any other game that he appears in;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;he does not act the same;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:54 PM;Naw barret has a lot of development;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:55 PM;i remember in the beginning of FFVII cloud acted like he didnt care much about his friends;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:55 PM;in FF7 not counting any supplementary material;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:55 PM;Cloud goes through a full character arc;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 03:55 PM;I agree 100% @Treble#5035;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:55 PM;"And I think ff7 is a decent game. Not the best ff, def not the worst.";;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:56 PM;^^;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:56 PM;I would say it's well above decent;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:56 PM;But - and it might be in part because of the compilation to be fair - I have trouble accepting certain things in it.;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:56 PM;cloud finding his memories was so weird tho;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:56 PM;I mean cannon is subjective in most square games anyway;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 03:56 PM;because of how inconsistant they are;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:57 PM;Cloud getting his memory back is where the game falls off for me.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:57 PM;"Like, _really_ falls off.";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:57 PM;At that point - other than Barret I will concede - none of the characters retain any of the development they've really shown throughout the game if there was any and Tifa just sort of becomes the girlfriend;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;Which sucks because I actually like Tifa and there's so much more to her than that.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;It's issues like this that I'm hoping they fix and/or change in the remake.;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;i thought cloud's backstory is cool;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;but i hate how it was told;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;cus it made no sense;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;It was basically told nonsensically and at the expense of another character;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:58 PM;which bothers me;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:59 PM;it also doesnt explain how he was emo in the beginning;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:59 PM;he has zach's memories so he should be happy ans shit;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 03:59 PM;i assume his death triggered it but thats debatable;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:59 PM;most of that stuff is backstory that's not really touched on in the game.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:59 PM;like how it was months before tifa found cloud after zack died.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 03:59 PM;and how he was emaciated.;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 04:00 PM;I honestly don't even know who Zack is;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:00 PM;play Crisis Core;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:00 PM;he's Like Laguna;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:00 PM;is to Squall;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;"I think Squall was done much better than Cloud was, and better than Lightning for that matter.";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;"They're all different, yet similar.";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;"And Squall is the only one that got decent development - but admittedly at the expense, again, of other characters.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;if it wasn't for the Orphanage;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;I would be inclined to agree;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;"Since if your name wasn't Squall, Rinoa, Seifer, Edea, or Laguna, you really didn't get much development in VIII.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:01 PM;that knocks it down a considerable degree;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:02 PM;I gotta say I like the callback to 3 that 8's cast is;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:02 PM;Rinoa aside;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:03 PM;They're all orphans with similar origin stories they can't recall;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:03 PM;if that plot point didn't exist or the plot was done better to weave that in it would have been fine;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:04 PM;but as is it's a bad tool used for the plot;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:07 PM;I was fine with it explicitly because that was the point;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:07 PM;They were together because they would be the SeeD who defeated Ultimecia;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:07 PM;The game is more or less about her orchestrating her own fate;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:08 PM;there were an infinite amount of ways to convey that rather than lazily shoving that scene in;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:09 PM;and lasting plot wholes that spring up because of it does it no real favors;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:11 PM;i felt most plot holes were covered by the fact that they lost their longterm memory.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:11 PM;due to GF use;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:11 PM;"I thought that was interesting way to explain that relationship, of summons and summoners.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:12 PM;it could have if the writers bothered to fill in the story;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:13 PM;as it stands it's a rather lazy way to erase meaningful interactions and character/story moments;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:13 PM;I mean... Irvine remembers. That's the only thing I take issue with.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:13 PM;Is why he didn't say anything.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:16 PM;that's like;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:16 PM;the issue with FF13 as a whole;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:16 PM;people not talking;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:16 PM;about anything meaningful;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:17 PM;that's why hope is the most developed character;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 04:17 PM;Hue that's weird;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:17 PM;because he doesn't do that after a certain point;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 04:17 PM;I live in a town called Irvine;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:17 PM;how different would the hope/snow dynamic be if he said something it at the beginning of the game and have an *actual* awkward relationship;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:17 PM;because of that;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:18 PM;i like the vendetta thing because after the incident in the alley where hope _actually_ tries to kill him;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:18 PM;there's a lot of development and a notable shift in dynamic;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:19 PM;Probably due to how fiercely Snow protects Hope after the fall.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:19 PM;And then Hope does the same thing when Snow is laid up at his house.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:19 PM;which would have been more powerful had he actually being having character moments with snow throught the game;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:20 PM;"True, I don't disagree with that, but there was still some pretty good lead up";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:20 PM;Like his scenes with Lightning while the party was split.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:21 PM;that's all 13 is;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:22 PM;good lead up?;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:22 PM;or the party being split;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:22 PM;yes;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:25 PM;"well i mean the initial split, before you get fang.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:27 PM;nono;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:27 PM;the first point;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:30 PM;ahh;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:30 PM;i thought the yes just meant;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:30 PM;both;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:30 PM;so i was trying to clarify lol.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:33 PM;13 is a bunch of fantastic templates that were mismanaged;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:35 PM;"there's a reason that the sequels, at least xiii-2, enhanced on stuff already there";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:36 PM;those were the biggest contributing factor to 13's drop in quality;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:36 PM;and the reason why numbered FF's don't usually have sequals;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 04:37 PM;I'm confused. Do people like XIII or hate. This server gives vibes that it's good and I have bad taste;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:37 PM;if all the core development was self contained;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 04:37 PM;I'm so stuck;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:37 PM;we could have had one of the best parties in the series;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 04:38 PM;nvm got it by accident;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:38 PM;@Dashboard#0598 it's THE most polarizing game in the series;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:39 PM;the number 13 living up to it's unlucky stigma;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 04:39 PM;How symbolic;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:39 PM;but that said you can say that's what's holding back 15 as well;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:39 PM;15 and 7 give it a run for it's money tho;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 04:40 PM;So am I the one with bad taste?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 04:40 PM;it's more because attention has shifted;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 04:40 PM;like;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:40 PM;7 isn't as polarizing as it is an overexposed conversation the fanbase has with itself;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 04:40 PM;XIII has probably been better recieved in the last 2 years than it was when the game was actually relevant;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 04:40 PM;same with XII;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;Maybe we'll get a rerelease;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;Who knows;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;XII is probably an even bigger case of things just flipping around drastically;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;XII actually is deserved of it's newfound appreciation;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;"I remember when people used to beat the shit out of XII, now everyone loves it. Maybe due to IZJS and ZA";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;There was a rumor that one of the anniversary things they're doing is a compilation release of the fabula nova crystallis trilogy;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;were 13 has a lot of apologist;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;for ps4;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;it's actually the thing i think might be most likely.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 04:41 PM;from those rumors;;

Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:11 PM;Well they have history of casting properly before then too.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:12 PM;If they could cast for both they did.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:12 PM;I just wanted to comment on that;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:12 PM;The Little Mermaid and BaTB for instance;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:12 PM;my point is just that it's not a perfect comparison;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:12 PM;actually wouldn't that be 90 years?;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:13 PM;snow white was 1930;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:13 PM;80 years this year;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:13 PM;never mind;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:13 PM;1937;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:14 PM;And shows with a musical bent like Adventure Time and Steven Universe also cast accordingly.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:14 PM;it's not a bad thing no;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:15 PM;*however I wouldn't say the cast of adventure time are great singers*;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:15 PM;but that's not the point of the show;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:15 PM;"some of them are. not all of them, no. lol";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:15 PM;Like Marceline;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:15 PM;she's okay yea;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:15 PM;John is also fine;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:16 PM;SU is more appropriate for my comparison.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:16 PM;Since the musical aspect is literally a point to it.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:16 PM;The worst singer in the cast is probably Zach Callison but he's still not bad at all.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:16 PM;to be fair many Cartoons aren't musical anymore;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:16 PM;fair*;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:17 PM;Unfortunately.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:17 PM;SU does well with itself because they specifically cast people with musical backgrounds.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:17 PM;And they can dig pretty deeply.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:17 PM;One character is voiced by _Nicki fucking Minaj_;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:17 PM;it's like the only one;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:18 PM;which is a good and bad thing;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:18 PM;I think that last cartoon to really drive original music is Phinias and Ferb;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:18 PM;"Other than SU, yeah.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:18 PM;and probaly Batman the Brave and the Bold;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;other than that even Theme songs have been almost non-existant;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;I blame;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;freaking CN real;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;threw off everything for like 7 years;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;https://youtu.be/Ussqi3nagrQ;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:19 PM;but i mean if it means we get _genuinely stunning_ songs like this i'm okay with it.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:20 PM;the resurgence is coming;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:20 PM;dunno what Nick is gonna do though pffttt;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:20 PM;they haven't had a hit since avatar;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:20 PM;"well, TLOK";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:20 PM;but >still technically avatar;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:20 PM;TMNT is fine but not nearly enough to carry the whole network;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:21 PM;tmnt and power rangers;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:21 PM;that's what nick has;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:21 PM;and it's not really enough;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:21 PM;and Spongebob on life support;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:21 PM;same for fairly odd parents.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:22 PM;they're coasting on the fumes of third party franhises and constants that are nearing two decades old.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:22 PM;oof;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:22 PM;oof*;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:22 PM;"meanwhile cn has stuff like su, ok ko, even teen titans go and sonic boom";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:22 PM;"disney has _two channels_ worth of stuff like raven's home, andi mack, pokemon, star vs the forces of evil.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;at one point they almost threw in real Anime;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;then they stopped;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;yea;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;nick doesn't even air digimon anymore;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;yup;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;they had that for a minute but stopped.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;the last real hit they had was legend of korra but we see how they treated that due to lgbt themes;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:23 PM;but then look at cn with su and disney channel with andi mack;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:24 PM;I have 0 idea where Cartoons will be going next;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:24 PM;"cartoons _need_ to follow the example of SU, OK KO, avatar.";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;kids are getting smarter.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;not even super hero Cartoons can save the dying atmosphere;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;superhero cartoons are starting to be marketed at adult audiences.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;I would like to say Kids were always and are smart;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;"with the new wb streaming service having YJ and CW Seed having Constantine, The Ray, and Vixen.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;but Creators had a lot more freedom;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;fair;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:25 PM;it's like they had a lot of freedom in the 90's that was lost after the mid 00's;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:26 PM;yup;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:26 PM;too many regulations and mismanagement;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:26 PM;they're only just now getting it back.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:26 PM;adventure time was probably the start.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:26 PM;"adventure time, su, etc.";;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:26 PM;more like the entire New Guard of CN;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;it was pretty solid;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;not all but most of it.;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;Voltron is so good;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;Voltron is everything I ever wanted out of an animated toku series.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;yup;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;The only CN new guard show that I don't think fits is TTGo;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:27 PM;It's also the most popular new guard show;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:28 PM;(and I guess PPG...);;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;it's just there to hold up the network really;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;Super Hero Cartoons have *Always* been bread and butter;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;Kids just like TT Go because it's dumb tho;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;That's why it does better than JLA;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;rip Young Justice;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:29 PM;YJ is ok;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;it's gonna be for the best that it is where it is now;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;it never had a chance to get really good;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;just 2 seasons;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;It _did_;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;but the problem is cartoon network's hiatus schedules.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;i have high hopes for s3;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;I mean it *is* good;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;but it could have been *really good*;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;wait;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:30 PM;you do know tj is coming back;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;right lol.;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;yes;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;yj*;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;it was canceled;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;okay i was making sure i wasn't talking around you on accident;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;along with Symbionic titan;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;then it got ressurected;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;dunno the details on it's revival tho;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:31 PM;but most networks hate heavy action cartoons for some reason;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:32 PM;it's being revived as part of wb's own streaming servie;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:32 PM;service;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:32 PM;even though they are usually fantastic;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:32 PM;it's helping to launch it;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:32 PM;oh I see;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:32 PM;some art has been released. not much else.;;

Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:33 PM;was the same VA from the movie;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 06:34 PM;i really like the main cast for The Team this season;;
Kirby#6473;03-Nov-17 06:39 PM;looks rad;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:10 PM;Are the worlds of FF ever explored in Kingdom Hearts?;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:11 PM;Or are the worlds exclusive to Disney worlds;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:12 PM;only original worlds;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:12 PM;and Disney worlds;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:12 PM;most of the cameos are placed in original worlds;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:12 PM;"Traverse Town, Hallow Bastion, etc...";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;some appear outside;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;^;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;"primarily Cloud, Sephy, Auron and Zack";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;Most of whom appear in the Coliseum / Athens;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;the rest are placed in an original world not related to FF;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;So they never visit Midgar or anything like they;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;That*;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;no;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;nope;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;What a missed opportunity;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:13 PM;FF cameos are purely for hey I remember this character;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;they otherwise have very little importance in the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;and most of the time you don't see them;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;They do that with the Disney characters too;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;Not exactly;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;I get that vibe atleast;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;The Disney characters tend to have worlds that revolve around them and mc's are often party members.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:14 PM;the disney characters have most importance;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;all of the disney villians in KH1 for example;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;were actively apart of the game's plot;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;for instance the atlantica world from kh1 or the mulan one from kh2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;similar things happened in KH2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;but I think that was mainly Pete and Maleficent;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;Would it effect the story if they were different characters?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;if who were?;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;That's an aweful question;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:15 PM;i mean;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:16 PM;yes it would;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:16 PM;My question was awful;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:16 PM;Yeah I wasn't thinking straight;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:16 PM;particularly because _certain disney worlds are entirely based on the disney films_;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:16 PM;If or if not the Disney characters feel shoved in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:17 PM;I think what people need to do when regarding KH;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:17 PM;I'm still disappointed about the missed opportunity about not letting me explore Midgar or Alexandria or anything FF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:17 PM;is get this idea that KH is some kind of FF spinoff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:17 PM;out of their head;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:17 PM;KH is composed of Disney related stuff mostly;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:17 PM;But that begs the question;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;Is KH a spinoff of those movies?;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;kh was literally designed like;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;what if we took disney movies and put them in a final fantasy-esque roleplaying setting?;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;and the ff properties were added as an afterthought;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;I see KH as its own entity;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;It's such a weird mix mash;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;it isn't a spinoff of anything;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;you're basically right ultima;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;just a collab between two companies;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:18 PM;It looks like a spin off but it isn't.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:19 PM;and clearly Disney is the bigger influence;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:19 PM;I think the reason why people confuse KH and FF so much is because of the terminology being shared;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:20 PM;Also;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:20 PM;Apparently;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:20 PM;"Squall, Cloud, Vivi etc are not the real Squall Cloud and what not";;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:20 PM;They're people similar to them I think;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;Squall and Leon are the same they just changed his name;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;Nu;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;I mean;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;one of the characters even calls him by Squall but he prefers Leon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;"Vivi is real, there was just a section in the game where you fought clones of him that were fake";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;due to story reasons;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;Cloud is....;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:21 PM;Cloud I guess;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;The Squall in KH is not the same Squall in VIII. they're literally completely different characters entirely;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;It's so confusing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;idk where you heard that from;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;they're unique to the kh universe;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;is what he means;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;which is true.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;well yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;but that also applies to World of FF;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;it's still Squall though;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;Yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:22 PM;even if they may not recall everything from the games they originated from;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:23 PM;like in WoFF for example;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:23 PM;Tidus and Yuna didn't even know each other;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:23 PM;the game just made a reference to their relationship by having Tidus act as the hero at one point;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;and you can see the initial spark when they interact for the first time;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;certain characters were even taken from different points in their timelines.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;"tidus and yuna are from ffx, rikku is from x-2 for instance.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;That's one thing that I loved about that game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;it was full of cameos;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;but they still made it feel original;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:24 PM;They did catch the characters;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:25 PM;Just the idea of them being completely different beings is hard to digest;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:26 PM;And idk if I like these FF characters are just played off as hey remember us?;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:27 PM;Also;;
Dashboard#0598;03-Nov-17 07:27 PM;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are gonna be in KH 3 right?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:27 PM;They're not different beings in a literal sense though;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;03-Nov-17 07:47 PM;yes;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 07:48 PM;So far they haven’t;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:48 PM;we've already seen five party members at a time;;

monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:49 PM;i'm thinking that like;;

monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:50 PM;"sora + donald + goofy gameplay, riku + mickey gameplay, kairi + axel gameplay";;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:50 PM;and then idk how aqua and ventus come in;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:50 PM;they won't be that important but ven will have his own / roxas' playstyle.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:50 PM;if he's playable at all;;

Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:50 PM;I've seen suggestions that Aqua's playstyle will be given to Sora or another character.;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:50 PM;I can see it.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 07:51 PM;Snot like Axel cares anymore;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:51 PM;if anything he fights kind of more similarly to kh2 sora;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:51 PM;or 3D sora;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:51 PM;@Treble#5035 aqua's playstyle is already similar to riku's at the end of 3D;;

Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:51 PM;I need to get 2.8;;

monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:52 PM;"they both use doubleflight, ghost drive, teleport, -splicer attacks, etc";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:53 PM;Surprising choice;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 07:53 PM;I'd have thoug Riku would be more similar to Terra;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 07:53 PM;Same really;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:53 PM;riku is between terra and aqua now;;

monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 07:54 PM;i guess showing how he matured in skill and etc;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 07:54 PM;XD;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 07:54 PM;Inb4 Kairi goes evil;;

monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:01 PM;"no, roxas is sora's nobody";;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:02 PM;he's just influenced by ventus's heart or whatever;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:02 PM;it's all very confusing and stupid;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:02 PM;"sora basically has 3 completely different people inside him, not including his own heart";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 08:02 PM;He’s Sora and Ven’s *child*;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 08:02 PM;XD;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:02 PM;😭;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:03 PM;3D suggests roxas could function as a separate person;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:03 PM;but 2 hammers in that they are two halves of a whole;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:03 PM;"they retcon and revise their own lore so often, we have no way of knowing what's really true";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 08:03 PM;I feel like King Mickey and Yen Sid will have backup warriors just in case;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:04 PM;there's just;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:04 PM;so much;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 08:04 PM;I Also think Xehenort will have backups as well;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:04 PM;i also saw a theory that kairi isn't really the princess of heart;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:04 PM;but;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:04 PM;namine is;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 08:05 PM;Which doesn’t work;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:05 PM;considering they made it canon that mickey and yen sid completely withheld TAV's existence from the rest of the cast for about 12 years (2 years in semi-active contact with sora) i can believe that they have desperate contingency plans;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:05 PM;"and also considering that the canon itself is convoluted and self-contradicting, theories are just naturally going to be *even worse*";;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:06 PM;yeah;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:06 PM;most theories make sense from a certain angle;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:07 PM;"it seems stupid to me that they'd have roxas and namine re-join themselves with the understanding that it'd make them into whole people , if they're just going to declare that they were ALREADY whole people, and now they're just whole people with other whole people inside them";;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:07 PM;like what now? forcibly eject the 3 residents of sora's heart? just keep them in there forever?;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:07 PM;both seem improbable and weird;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:07 PM;This last trailer sort of implied that they'll be coming back as whole people;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:07 PM;but I mean they've been retconning shit like this ever since Lea came back;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:08 PM;They have no clue what they're doing with KH;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:08 PM;KH2 made me think that nomura was a mastermind;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:09 PM;or perhaps BBS did;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:09 PM;yeah it was BBS;;
monokomonoe#8934;03-Nov-17 08:09 PM;however everything SINCE BBS has made me think nomura is just randomly doing whatever;;
Treble#5035;03-Nov-17 08:10 PM;i feel like he absolutely is;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:40 PM;"`3D suggests roxas could function as a separate person`, , If you've seen the trailers for 3, you know Sora's trying to find a way to separate Roxas from himself while retaining his own existence.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:40 PM;Xemnas taunted him for it in a trailer;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:42 PM;I still want to see inside Luxu's box;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:43 PM;which we know Maleficent is searching for;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 10:47 PM;The real question is: Will [redacted] return?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:48 PM;"No, That's not the real question, The real question is, is the crackpot theory that the Master of Masters is actually Braig correct?";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:49 PM;also I was about to make a literally who joke but you redacted;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 10:49 PM;My theory is MOM the original Master Xenehort. Who says Old Man Xenehort is his original body?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:50 PM;"eh, MoM doesn't seem nearly as malevolent as Master Xehanort";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 10:50 PM;Nether did Terra;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:50 PM;"I mean, he wasn't, lol, still isn't, really";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:51 PM;"the difference is we *know* Xehanort took his body, it always seemed implied to me that that was his original form, he was always digging for secrets about the Keyblade War, if he were the MoM he wouldn't have needed to because he basically would've been there";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:52 PM;"it also would've been counterproductive to give the Keyblade to Luxu, leave, then come back and somehow manage to reacquire it later";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:52 PM;"I don't actually think MoM is anyone, I was just kidding around";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:52 PM;by word of God we're never seeing him again;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 10:53 PM;"Which theory is more silly though: He's Braig, Deadpool, or original Xenehort?";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:54 PM;...Deadpool of course;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:54 PM;personality's right but he doesn't break the 4th wall enough;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:55 PM;also Deadpool is a bit more aggressive;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 10:55 PM;MoM is extremely passive;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 11:12 PM;your mom's passive;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Nov-17 11:12 PM;:P;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 11:40 PM;no she's not she's a Jewish woman who grew up in the Bronx in the 60s and 70s;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 11:40 PM;literally the most inaccurate possible descriptor for her;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 11:40 PM;that and quiet;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;03-Nov-17 11:41 PM;passive and quiet would be objectively incorrect;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:27 PM;man I really love this game a lot;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;04-Nov-17 02:30 PM;Kefka truly is the scariest villian in the series;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:32 PM;I think any of the villains that came close to or achieved their goal are scary af tbh;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:32 PM;Kefka just takes it a step farther because FF6 actually feels like a _war._;;
Definitely am Pitou#4934;04-Nov-17 02:36 PM;I never really felt like there was a war in xv tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:37 PM;that's because the game never let you experience it;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:38 PM;there are a few ff's the deal with war whee it doesn't exactly feel the same as war.;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:39 PM;though maybe my argument is that VI's is one of the ones that felt the most realistic.;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:39 PM;along with tactics and xii;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:42 PM;idk;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:42 PM;does ivalice seem to birth war stories in general?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:42 PM;or stories with a lot of politics involved;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:42 PM;yeah ivalice is incredibly political;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:42 PM;which leads to it being involved in war stories in most of it's games.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:43 PM;also one thing I find interesting about videogames;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:44 PM;like the religious factor of the game is viewed by the public as good;;

Definitely am Pitou#4934;04-Nov-17 02:45 PM;dude x is the most anti religous game i've ever played;;

Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:46 PM;i hate certain things about -will- but find certain other things interesting;;
Treble#5035;04-Nov-17 02:46 PM;why do i hate myself;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Nov-17 02:46 PM;Tales of Berseria is like that too;;

Dizzypunch#0641;07-Nov-17 03:29 PM;i dont think i got much further than I have now on vanilla until my ps2 became unplayable;;
Dizzypunch#0641;07-Nov-17 03:29 PM;bergan gave me ptsd;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:28 PM;Reminder that the second in command in FFIX is a six year old girl.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:28 PM;As far as party leaders go.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:29 PM;That was amazing when it happened at the fight with Necron;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:29 PM;It's really funny in the desert palace too;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:29 PM;Just little Eiko;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:29 PM;"leading around characters like steiner, freya, amarant, even dagger.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:29 PM;who was still a princess even if she was mute at the time.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:32 PM;Well she did pretty much raise herself.  She's got guts.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:33 PM;_True_;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:33 PM;I just love Eiko Carol so much lmao;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:34 PM;"There's a pretty good fanfic about her, with a Vivi that came back wrong. I can't remember the name of it, only that Eiko grew up as a badass magical mechanic type";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:34 PM;Oh my god.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:35 PM;"I remember having a discussion in here a while about IX getting a TAY style sequel (as in, a substantial amount of years later) and my ideal mc's are Eiko and one of Vivi's kids.";;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:36 PM;That would be *amazing*. Not gonna lie! Makoto could tag along;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:36 PM;"Eiko, Vivi 2, Makoto, Puck.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:37 PM;Plus at least some of the old cast and some new guys.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:38 PM;"Depending on how much time has passed, offspring of Steiner and Beatrix";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:38 PM;That would be cute as heck.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:38 PM;My thinking was about ten years to make Eiko the same age as Garnet at the start of the game.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:39 PM;"Oh that'd work, I could buy a ten year old tagging along";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:40 PM;A little ten year old squire child.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:40 PM;Has a mix of seiken and magic sword;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:41 PM;Is either adorably pompus and follows Eiko to protect her (as Princess of Lindblum) or is a little badass like her mother;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 04:42 PM;Or both!;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:42 PM;Both;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:42 PM;Definitely both;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:43 PM;"Puck is obviously the dragoon, probably trained under both Fratley and Freya.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:43 PM;Still a lil shit.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:43 PM;"A sassy Dragoon, I love it.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:45 PM;I also feel like Garnet and Zidane are obligated to join up eventually.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 04:48 PM;Dagger is too busy running Alexandria.  Zidane tags along for a short bit but eventually gets stopped by Steiner/Beatrix who Garnet sent after him to bring him home.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:49 PM;If you don't think Dagger would leave Steiner and Beatrix in charge _again_...;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:49 PM;Zidane is the kind of king that's hardly ever around already.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:49 PM;I can see Garnet pulling off a Big Damn Heroes moment;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:50 PM;also - are there little half genome babies? 🤔;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:50 PM;Garnet and Zidane would be in their late 20's at this point.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:50 PM;_OH MY GOD_;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:50 PM;"One of the party members is Zidane and Dagger's son, an eight year old summoner/genome half breed.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:50 PM;He has both the tail and the horn.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:53 PM;Oh that would be *adorable*;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:55 PM;he is eiko's lil buddy and she loves him;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:55 PM;~~he has a crush on her~~;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 04:56 PM;YES.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 04:56 PM;The circle would be complete.;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 04:58 PM;YES;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 04:59 PM;One of the last three spots is Quina 👀;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Always Quina;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:05 PM;"The last spots are probably one newbie and one last veteran, that feels about right.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:05 PM;Maybe Amarant.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:05 PM;He seems perfectly grumpy.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:06 PM;"`He has both the tail and the horn` I have no clue what I walked into, but wouldn't horn babies be very painful (more than usual) on the mother?";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:06 PM;I feel like a summoner's horn grows _after_ birth.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:07 PM;Just imagine the pain of that;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:07 PM;summoner babies cry _a lot_;;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 05:08 PM;Maybe it's kind of soft when the baby is born? And hardens when they grow older.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:09 PM;Would make sense.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:11 PM;`Maybe it's kind of soft when the baby is born? And hardens when they grow older.` I know something else that goes from soft to hard ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°);;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:11 PM;A rubber ball when you freeze it;;

Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:15 PM;"but yes this has been ffix-2 as brought to you by aruu, treble, and dinoken 😆";;
Aruu#2066;07-Nov-17 05:15 PM;Send this entire conversation to Square Enix;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 05:18 PM;Tell them to stop whatever they're working on and to hire us to write IX-2;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:26 PM;"I don't have the time to read all of it, so could someone sum up what you have for 9-2?";;

Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:28 PM;^;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:28 PM;there was no plot talked about tho tbf lmap;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:28 PM;lmao*;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:28 PM;"so, wouldn't it be a disaster?";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:28 PM;"Just that it'd be set ten years later, Eiko and Vivi2 are the mcs, Puck and Makoto and Quina are there as well as the kids of Zidane/Dagger and Steiner/Beatrix.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:29 PM;TAY is only a conceptual comparison;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:29 PM;as in it happens a substantially long amount of time later.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:30 PM;Vivi and Eiko a couple?;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:30 PM;I feel like he needs a name that isn't Vivi.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:30 PM;But maybe?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:31 PM;Vivsters Junior;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:31 PM;no wait! Viivii;;

Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:34 PM;"you can name one, quina. okay. quina names them vivi. but that's-- QUINA NAMES THEM VIVI. ... we'll call him junior.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:42 PM;Zidane and Dagger's child? Boy? Girl? Name?;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 05:42 PM;John Tribal.;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 05:43 PM;Or John Alexandros I guess;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:43 PM;Vivi this is John John this is Vivi;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 05:43 PM;Since Alexandria is a matriarical society;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:43 PM;Yeah I feel like Zidane would take Garnet's name.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:43 PM;John doesn't work for me;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:43 PM;Too normal;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:44 PM;what if they named him kuja;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:44 PM;awwww;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:44 PM;🤔;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:44 PM;"On a side note: If I'm not mistaken, you actually name Steiner's *last* name";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:44 PM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:44 PM;you do;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:45 PM;his given name is _adelbert_;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:45 PM;Adelbert Rusty;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:45 PM;"also, imagine if you will, zidane missing his son's birth by JUST A HAIR TRIGGER MOMENT and then when he gets there he sees Garnet and the baby and he's like";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:45 PM;Adelbert Assbutt;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:45 PM;"What's their name?, ... Kuja. We'll call him Kuja.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:45 PM;cue tears.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:46 PM;Zidane's now the leader of Tantalus;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:47 PM;nah Zidane is the king of Alexandria;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:47 PM;_Blank_ is the leader of Tantalus.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:48 PM;"What's Eiko, now she's the daughter of Cid and Hilda?";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:49 PM;Princess of Lindblum.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:49 PM;On a side note: I thought they were her *birth* parents. Which confused me. I also didn't know the concept of adoption then.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:50 PM;"Which is kinda strange, seeing as I watched Digimon as a kid...";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:50 PM;Digimon doesn't make it easy.;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:50 PM;What with Takeru and Yamato having two different surnames just because their parents split up.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:51 PM;There's also Izzy;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:53 PM;Yeah but I was saying that Takaishida kids make it hard.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:54 PM;"But back on topic: To kick off IX-2's plot, to mirror 9, but in reverse, something's fishy/dark is happening in Lindblum, so Zidane hires Tantalus to kidnap Eiko. Either Cid and Hilda die during the chaos, or are kidnapped themselves.";;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:54 PM;if cid dies there needs to be a replacement cid;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:54 PM;i think killing hilda off when she was such a nonfactor in the first game would be a bad idea;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:55 PM;Hilda Garde V stolen?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 05:56 PM;"knowing Cid, he would have made a few more";;

Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 05:56 PM;Hilda Garde IX;;
Dinoken2#0946;07-Nov-17 05:56 PM;Or Hilda Garde XVIII;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:57 PM;lmao;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:57 PM;i approve IX;;
Treble#5035;07-Nov-17 05:57 PM;or XIX;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 06:01 PM;He would have harnessed the teleportation technology of the Invisible for Hilda Garda IV and future models;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Nov-17 06:02 PM;"along a few other things, like the controls";;
Seymour#0747;07-Nov-17 07:24 PM;ok I haven't played 13-3 or any 13. but I'm searching up pictures of the final boss. and damn he has such a cool design;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;07-Nov-17 07:26 PM;which one lol;;

Lime#6560;07-Nov-17 11:01 PM;"Why not, I guess?";;
Seymour#0747;08-Nov-17 09:05 PM;does FFX2 have any asinine puzzles like in FFX?;;
Treble#5035;08-Nov-17 09:05 PM;Yes.;;
Treble#5035;08-Nov-17 09:06 PM;The notable one is either at the end of chapter 2 or beginning of chapter 3 when you go to the Bevelle Underground.;;
Treble#5035;08-Nov-17 09:06 PM;And then another at the v end of the game;;
Malfred#1000;09-Nov-17 01:57 AM;"They're pretty simple, and almost entirely optional";;
Treble#5035;09-Nov-17 02:03 AM;The one at endgame is optional as well but you have to fight a boss that it's incredibly easy not to be ready for if you don't complete it.;;
Malfred#1000;09-Nov-17 02:50 AM;Yes;;
Malfred#1000;09-Nov-17 02:50 AM;But also very rewarding to beat;;
Waterish#7858;09-Nov-17 04:22 AM;Spoilers... Lightning is Noctis's mom;;
Waterish#7858;09-Nov-17 04:22 AM;"I just made that up, please don't believe that anyone";;

monokomonoe#8934;09-Nov-17 08:21 PM;noctis didn't have a mom;;
monokomonoe#8934;09-Nov-17 08:21 PM;it was immaculate conception;;
monokomonoe#8934;09-Nov-17 08:21 PM;because he's a christ figure;;

Car#4176;10-Nov-17 01:17 AM;What;;
Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 01:18 AM;noctis is the christ child.;;
Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 01:18 AM;apparently.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Nov-17 01:47 AM;Does that mean every protag that's missing at least one parent is also a christ child?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;10-Nov-17 01:49 AM;I wouldn't exactly say that but most could fit as  holy saints in the FF Bible;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Nov-17 01:50 AM;Cloud is the spikeyest holy saint;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;10-Nov-17 01:52 AM;"St Strife the spiky, the patron saint of big ass swords";;

Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 02:51 AM;Squall is like;;
Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 02:51 AM;One of TWO ff protags who we know both parents;;
Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 02:52 AM;Two and a half if we count Lightninf;;
Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 02:52 AM;The other one is Tidus;;
Treble#5035;10-Nov-17 02:52 AM;They're the normies.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Nov-17 02:53 AM;"Do we *know* for sure Squall's parents are Laguna and Raine? I mean, sure, it's **heavily** implied they are, but is it actually stated in game?";;
bob21897#2499;10-Nov-17 04:22 AM;do we count ceodore?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;10-Nov-17 04:26 AM;Do we count the After Years???;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Nov-17 06:12 AM;"I mean, Kiros and Ward specifically mention personally knowing Squall's parents, Squall joined the orphanage with Ellone and considered her *his* sister before the rest of the orphanage crew thought of her as Big Sis.  Plus it does state in game that Raine dies in childbirth with Laguna's child.  They do not *state* that Squall is the son of Laguna/Raine, but there's really no other option.";;
Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 06:21 AM;I like how three out of the five orphans have parents;;
Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 06:21 AM;"Okay, well two";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Nov-17 06:28 AM;Quistis had parents too;;

Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 06:46 AM;"That's not what an orphan is, Square!";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Nov-17 11:25 AM;"What if Laguna and Julia had a one night stand, which lead to the birth of Squall?";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;10-Nov-17 11:32 AM;I mean the screen *does* fade to black (if you do things right);;
Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 11:33 AM;Looks wise I could buy Julia being Squall's mother;;
Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 11:34 AM;That would be somewhat awkward for them;;

Waterish#7858;10-Nov-17 01:01 PM;This is hilarious and I now choose to believe it;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Nov-17 01:04 PM;What if the *entire* party are the children of Laguna and a random one night stand?;;
Waterish#7858;10-Nov-17 01:05 PM;Where'd all these orphans come from??;;
Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 01:07 PM;"Laguna; group daddy";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Nov-17 01:09 PM;It would explain the average maturity level;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Nov-17 01:09 PM;Squall and Quistis obviously take after their mothers.;;
Aruu#2066;10-Nov-17 01:10 PM;explains Zell being Zell;;

Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 04:58 PM;If they aren’t xehanort they are sora;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 04:58 PM;no they're *all* Xehanort;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 04:58 PM;That's the point;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;Imagine 13 Voldemorts;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;you're supposed???? to understand kingdom heartS????????????;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;the entire point of the Real Organization XIII is to create 13 Xehanorts;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;or 13 Sephiroths;;

fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;Wait wait wait wait wait.;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;there were more than 13 sephiroth's psycho;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;So.;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;bad comparison;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;"but luckily Riku, Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Lea rescued him on time";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;yes;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;"Sora, Riku, and Roxas were on the list";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;from different times and realities;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;But only two of them actually look like xehanorts.;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 04:59 PM;Right now;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;And one of them is just Terra.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;you can tell they're Xehanort because of the eyes;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;they all have the orange eyes;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;"Braig, and Isa are turning into Xehnorts";;

Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;No terra got his body taken;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;i need popcorn;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;"And for a brief second, Riku had the golden eyes at the end of 3D";;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;To become terranort;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;SO IS RIKU ALSO XEHANORT;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:00 PM;but Riku has outright accepted the darkness within himself to such an extent that he's immune to Xehanort's machinations;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;Riku is a red mage;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;wait.;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;Sora likes to hit things with his keyblade;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;So eraqus knew nothing of xeha's plans right?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;correct;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;And kairi is a regular mage;;

Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;Ayy;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:01 PM;More like Luke Skywalker;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;And Lea is fine for no good reason even though he was in or13.;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;Lea turned good;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;the Organization Lea was part of was a fake Organization XIII;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;basically;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;Lea became whole again;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;He grew a heart;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;Just like Sora and Roxas did;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;And then everyone else who used to be in or13 has no more plot relevance?;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:02 PM;And Namine/Kairi;;

fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Saix?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;you're right;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;but it's just Saix now;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;it is Saix;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Blue haired;;

Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Saix;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Saix is the Nobody name;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Sux;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;It’s isa in bbs;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661 That's true;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;~~gottem~~;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;but it's Saix as he appears in DDD;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Because he’s not evil yet;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;He appears as Isa actually;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Lea just says Isa;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;no the scar;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;Lea says Isa because that's who he knew him as;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:03 PM;the scar means it's Saix;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;not really;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;Yeah lea knew saix as isa when they were good;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;we don't know what Whole-Isa looks like as an adult;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;But now isa is bad;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;so there's no real way to say for sure that was Isa;;
fine and dandy#9438;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;So basically Lea and Isa were just extremely unlucky and ended up in the fake or13;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;"After his destruction, Saïx is revived as Isa, then is transformed back into Saïx along with Xigbar.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;"yep, that";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:04 PM;it's complicated;;

Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:05 PM;Vanitas is basically confirmed as one of the seekers of darkness;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:07 PM;the not aging is probably an effect of Castle Oblivion;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:08 PM;at the same time aging is a myth;;

Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:08 PM;_Aging is a myth_;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:08 PM;and Castle Oblivion is in between the realms;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Nov-17 05:09 PM;I guess Namine as well;;
Red the mage#7764;12-Nov-17 05:09 PM;But if she does that then the black hole comes back doesn’t it?;;
Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:09 PM;a general assumption is that tidus and wakka aged too.;;

Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:14 PM;the pleb;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;12-Nov-17 05:14 PM;yes but back then it was sort of a generic term;;

Treble#5035;12-Nov-17 05:15 PM;that's probably true;;

Waterish#7858;14-Nov-17 04:50 PM;I saw something cool that hinted that Seifer wanted to be a knight that protects the sorceress deep down because when he was younger he saw the movie that Laguna stared in where he was a knight protecting a sorceress;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Nov-17 09:06 PM;mb dude I was busy;;
Waterish#7858;17-Nov-17 10:37 PM;Is it just me or is the new Nier far more popular than the old one ever was?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Nov-17 10:38 PM;It's because Automata is actually good;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Nov-17 10:39 PM;as well as being promoted by square so it got a lot of recognition;;
Waterish#7858;17-Nov-17 10:39 PM;I really liked Nier;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Nov-17 10:39 PM;but the older games were niche;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Nov-17 10:39 PM;and there's probably a million similar games that were better so the incentive to play them wasn't all that big;;
Leon#9542;17-Nov-17 10:40 PM;first Nier would maybe be my favourite game ever if the gameplay didn't drag it down so much;;
Waterish#7858;17-Nov-17 10:40 PM;Yeah you're right. It wasn't as heavily promoted either like you said;;
Leon#9542;17-Nov-17 10:40 PM;"it does so much so well, but it plays soooo badly";;

Davkilla101#0932;21-Nov-17 08:26 PM;Like... Ok;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:26 PM;oh yeah his dialogue is nonsensical pontificating;;
Davkilla101#0932;21-Nov-17 08:26 PM;He does the most stupid taunts throughout the fight as well;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:27 PM;thing that annoyed me as well was that they brought back THE ARBITER;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:27 PM;in a tiny role;;
Davkilla101#0932;21-Nov-17 08:27 PM;"The twist of you not having finished him off the second time you run into him was nice, but that's pretty much the only thing good about it as you realise you have to yet again fight this fucker";;

Davkilla101#0932;21-Nov-17 08:29 PM;I don't think I can accurately put into words why I think Halo 5's campaign is shit;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:29 PM;the thing that fucks me off;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:29 PM;is that the plot twist itself is SO GOOD;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:29 PM;that I feel like I have to get Halo 6;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:29 PM;to see the conclusion of said twist through;;
Davkilla101#0932;21-Nov-17 08:30 PM;Though I think Raycevick does a really good job of putting into words my thoughts on the campaign: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb-Igsmk9-I;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:30 PM;i'm actually gonna listen to his multiplayer analysis first;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:31 PM;i wanna see if he agrees with my view;;
xPendulum#0001;21-Nov-17 08:34 PM;"wow I like this guy, he's right about how new movement felt cool and it's a clear attempt to re-create old Halo MP but the maps let it down";;

Treble#5035;25-Nov-17 10:26 AM;@nzkiwibro#4136 Think about everything with Seymour. Yuna found out about that on her own and was going to basically make a deal with the metaphorical devil to get him to turn himself in on her own without getting her Guardians involved.;;

The same was for Adventure of Mana which was released in 2016, which was again 15 years after the original.

Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 07:46 PM;The only ones that I've played that are after Final Fantasy X are Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIV.;;
Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 07:48 PM;I really enjoyed playing Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn and have only played alittle of Heavensward. I also liked Final Fantasy XIII dispite all the hatred towards it.;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;26-Nov-17 07:48 PM;*resists urge to hate on XIII*;;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 07:50 PM;I just disliked the story/characters in XIII and thought was a bit boring at times. XV just felt unfinished;;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 07:50 PM;I have XIV but barely played it;;
Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 07:54 PM;"I believe that the systems in Final Fantasy XIII could've be redesigned alittle bit better, like the Weapon Upgrade. During my playtime of Final Fantasy XIII, I only ever did upgrade the initial weapons for each character and never bothered switching their weapons. Also the accessories never really played a big role for me since I mainly only use the HP ones. But then again, I only played the game on Easy difficulty so other people's experiences may vary. The story and gameplay were pretty linear which I didn't mind at all really, since Final Fantasy X (the last Final Fantasy game I've played was also linear). The characters and their development to me seems pretty life-like dispite people saying they are really cringe, which to me just makes them seem more real.";;
Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 07:59 PM;"What I did dislike the most about the game was the ever changing narrative in the game. The party is always split up into two groups or so and you'd at times (usually after some major event) switch between the two groups, especially when you were starting to enjoy or become attached to those characters. Summons in the game played a very minor role in the game as far as I can tell.";;
Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;I'm not touching mooooost of this but um;;
Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;The summons were pretty pivotal;;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;"Combat system was cool, but I found it strange how you couldn't swap party members during combat since you could in 10. Also when the party leader dies it's game over which again felt like a really weird intentional step backwards. The game being linear was only a problem for me because I didn't care for the story moving forward";;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;Summons were actually part of the story iirc;;
Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;"Except for Shiva and maybe Bahamut, the summons always came about at a point of extreme emotional distress and strove for character development";;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;15 is an example of summons being non existent lol;;
Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:01 PM;Lightning and Hope never would've gotten to Palumpolum if not for Odin;;
Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 08:02 PM;"Only with the story, but then again it felt like they were just snuck up on there really. Using them really, that's a whole different story,";;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 08:04 PM;I've found myself never using summons in my current 9 playthrough;;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 08:05 PM;Summons in 13 I used often tbh but I played on a higher difficulty I think? Can't actually remember the difficulty setting you mentioned earlier lol;;

Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:06 PM;I also found that certain summons are more useful (to me) than others.;;

Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 08:07 PM;I think it's because I ever only stuck to one character as the Leader so it was the only summon available.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Nov-17 08:28 PM;including also confirming that there is a chance of an X-3 happening;;
Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:28 PM;a significant chance.;;
Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 08:28 PM;"Final Fantasy VIII was my first Final Fantasy game I've played on the PSOne and it was the first 3D one of the series I've played so it's more memorable than Final Fantasy X,";;

Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:29 PM;The only FF game I've played that's not really memorable for me is VII;;
action warrior#8892;26-Nov-17 08:30 PM;That x-3 thing sounds like how they spoke about the 7 remake for like a decade lol;;

Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:30 PM;VII remake was denied over and over and over again;;

Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:31 PM;honestly i wouldn't be surprised if we got it next year;;
Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:31 PM;because we WILL see a major FF release next year.;;

Treble#5035;26-Nov-17 08:32 PM;"we just don't know what it will be, and the chance of it being VIIR.1 are nil";;

Silverx1987#9781;26-Nov-17 08:35 PM;I think I've read that Part 1 was very well deep in development so it could be sooner than 2019/2020 release.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Nov-17 08:35 PM;Braska's journey wouldn't add much of anything other than a detailed experience of something we know much more about;;

Treble#5035;01-Dec-17 08:39 PM;"It was good largely in part due to the idea of the plot behind it - defying your fate - and overall having a different approach to the series in general. It's the story that's really the reason that I enjoyed it, because the gameplay wasn't that stellar and the characters were sort of... hit and miss. But I did latch on pretty well to at least one of the main cast members and I enjoyed what they gave us for the story.";;
Treble#5035;01-Dec-17 08:39 PM;"As for why they had three games, just because they wanted it to.";;
Treble#5035;01-Dec-17 08:40 PM;XIII could have been the end of it but XIII-2 is also the best game in the trilogy so I'm not going to complain.;;
Silverx1987#9781;01-Dec-17 08:44 PM;"I don't know the story of Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, but I'd think it would have something to do with Fabaula Nova Crystallis. Since it has came into fruition with Final Fantasy XIII and its spinoffs, I'd say that most of the developers have a basic idea of what the lore, politics, ideals, religion of the Final Fantasy XIII universe which would make it pretty simple to come up with a story that revolves around them.";;

Monsters won't look the other way, and characters won't spin right round., Third, it's not dispelled when you use a physical attack., Fourth, the Entice spell creates a bond between the Entice caster and the target. If the 'caster' of the Entice attack dies, the affected target will turn back to normal. If the caster of the Entice spell tries to attack with Entice on another target, it'll miss as long as the other target is still alive. Due to a bug, when one caster casts the spell on the target of another caster, the original caster - while not really having a target anymore - won't be able to Entice another target until his 'stolen' target is dead., , Needless to say, Entice cripples every boss as it will completely disable their AI Script and they will start to attack themselves., entice is op";;

Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:35 PM;I have no idea why Freya takes very little damage;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:35 PM;no phoenix downs?;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:35 PM;99;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:36 PM;But as soon as I revive anyone this boss does an AoE;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:36 PM;"So unless I could revive them with more HP, Freya is alone";;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:36 PM;could really quickly go into turbo mode;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:37 PM;/ invincible mode or whatever;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:37 PM;"then if not everyone gets revived right away, revive dagger and go from there.";;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:38 PM;Dagger can't use any spells;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:39 PM;I made a mistake bringing her;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:40 PM;I mean not untrue but you can use her to phoenix down Zidane and Amarant.;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:41 PM;Also - I still had no issue getting her to use spells when she was mute. I guess it was a fluke. lmao.;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:41 PM;I know it's because of um;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:41 PM;whatever the place is called but still.;;

Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:42 PM;She did it lol;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:42 PM;Fuck these critical HP attacks;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:42 PM;Had to use 2 elixirs;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:42 PM;I hope your character levels are all balanced;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:42 PM;Because now you gotta use the other guys;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:43 PM;It sure is going to be easier;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:43 PM;I can use all 4 characters;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:43 PM;And Amarant is not there;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:44 PM;Yeah if you had mentioned you were going into this part I would've told you to take Quina here if you needed a magic user.;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:44 PM;The Desert Palace is ridiculously easy with three mages and Steiner.;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:46 PM;;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/387072107428970506/unknown.png;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:46 PM;"Nope, Quina is probably going to be useless";;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 08:46 PM;"However, she has White Wind, so it might help a bit";;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:47 PM;Yeah they'd have been more useful with Zidane lol.;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:47 PM;"I've got it down to a science at this point whenever I get to where you're at to leave Dagger, Vivi, and Eiko behind with Steiner.";;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 08:47 PM;And then basically Freya and Zidane carry the other party while Amarant and Quina are good for items.;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 09:07 PM;This area sucks;;
Treble#5035;03-Dec-17 09:07 PM;Desert Palace still?;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 09:08 PM;Yep;;
Marcello#4574;03-Dec-17 09:08 PM;I'm already getting sick of the song and these puzzles;;

Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:27 PM;Time compression;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:27 PM;Or time loop;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:27 PM;I thought so;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:27 PM;I'd say time loop is more likely;;

Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:27 PM;"Until Jecht left, which broke the cycle.";;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:28 PM;Yeah i was thinking time loop;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:28 PM;Or some weird reincarnation thing as soon as someone dies;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:29 PM;Wait so how can jecht be tidus' father;;

action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:31 PM;This is what i'm asking lol;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:32 PM;Thought tidus was like a reincarnation of shuyin;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:32 PM;So which is it? Are they reincarnations or are they born like anyone else;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:34 PM;Neither and both?;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:34 PM;I mean I'm pretty sure the dream zanarkand is an imperfect Beckoning;;

action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:49 PM;I actually am going to give x-2 another chance;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:49 PM;Idk why;;
action warrior#8892;04-Dec-17 03:49 PM;Owned that game three times through no will of my own;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 03:50 PM;It's a genuinely good game brought down by an eccentric first act and the fact that it's the sequel to what most people consider a gaming masterpiece.;;

Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 05:03 PM;anyone know the best equipment store in IX?;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 05:06 PM;also can you teach steiner shock and climmahazard without doing chocobo hot and cold;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 05:07 PM;also random and weird but i ran into 3 pop quizes in a row lmao;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 05:16 PM;I feel like Steiner doesn't get Climhazzard?;;
Treble#5035;04-Dec-17 05:16 PM;Don't quote me on that;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 05:25 PM;i think i remember one weapon giving him shock and climhazzard but maybe im wrong;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 06:18 PM;He does get Climhazzard;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 06:18 PM;Cloud wannabe;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 06:25 PM;But Cloud had the Climhazzard;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 06:29 PM;Cloud stole Meteorain from Zack though;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:23 PM;"Zidane, Dagger, Vivi and Steiner";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-17 07:23 PM;What about Freya?  :HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:24 PM;Who?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:24 PM;Oh! You mean Fajita;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-17 07:24 PM;"Si,  fajita";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:25 PM;"You see, you gotta have Steiner, for Sword Magic with Vivi. Vivi, cause he's a badass. Dagger for the heals, and summons. She does have the better summons. Plus, Zidane cause Zidane, but let's say he's interchangeable. Well, steal is actually useful, for once!";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-17 07:26 PM;At least you don't take damage for a failed steal attempt *looks at Edge*;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:26 PM;i use quina eiko steiner and zidane lol;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:26 PM;Dagger sucks for a good chunk of the game...;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:26 PM;Still sucks here;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:26 PM;and i change quina and freya out together;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:27 PM;Except Dagger doesn't suck;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:27 PM;dagger sucks right now im at the point where all you get it daggers command failed;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:27 PM;I can't say Freya is bad;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:27 PM;I won a boss fight only using her;;

Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:27 PM;freya has dragon crest which can do 9999 if you farm dragons;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:28 PM;She managed to stay alive and kill the boss alone;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:28 PM;no but seriously effin dagger is pissing me off right now cuz eiko just got captured and dagger still cant speak so her commans fail all the time so i have like no healer lol;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;04-Dec-17 07:30 PM;Well nothing better to relax the mind than a game;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:31 PM;I'll be honest with you though;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:31 PM;It didn't keep up with the hype I had to play IX;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:32 PM;"So far, I can't say I've been enjoying IX more than I enjoyed IV - VII, to be honest";;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:33 PM;really? i think IX is one of the best final fantasies;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:34 PM;I have two major issues with this game;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:34 PM;The soundtrack and having to grind;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:35 PM;"Maybe because you're playing it wrong? There really is no need to grind. It's not a hard game. Also, have you given the soundtrack a fair shot? Actually listened with an open mind?";;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:35 PM;"Nope, I've not been playing it wrong. I remember some people here told I was really underleveled";;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:36 PM;I was getting one shot very frequently and some bosses were almost impossible to beat;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:36 PM;"It's not about listening the OST outside the game, it just isn't good enough to me";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:36 PM;"`I remember some people here told I was really underleveled, I was getting one shot very frequently and some bosses were almost impossible to beat` Then yes, you have been playing it wrong";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:36 PM;If you're having trouble with the game;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:37 PM;How's that then?;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:37 PM;I never escape from a battle;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:37 PM;And I was never underleveled in any other FF game I played so far;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:37 PM;"Except for a few final bosses, which is okay";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:37 PM;"If that was true, you wouldn't be underleveled";;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:37 PM;It is true;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;04-Dec-17 07:38 PM;oh boy here we go;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:38 PM;I don't have any reasons to lie;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:38 PM;"You had trouble against Amarant, one of the easiest bosses. Clearly, you're doing something wrong.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:38 PM;I can understand having trouble against Ark;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:38 PM;But not against Amarant;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:39 PM;"I didn't have much trouble with Ark, even though I only had one living character I did it well enough. First try, in fact";;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:39 PM;But I did have trouble with Amarant because I wasn't using specific abilities;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:39 PM;That's why;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:39 PM;what abilities?;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:39 PM;"Counter, more specifically";;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:40 PM;And defending at the right time;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:40 PM;well i never really grind until i get the blue narcosis and not because i need to but because i want to and i have never struggled with amarant;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:40 PM;"Also, there's no such thing as playing it wrong, I'm not that stupid to screw up with something, and never did so far.";;

Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:41 PM;hey he lived thats all that matters;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:41 PM;"If you're having trouble with *an easy game*, you're doing something wrong.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:41 PM;Having one character alive at the end isn't doing well.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:41 PM;That's a D-;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:41 PM;maybe you are rushing through the story?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:42 PM;"22 hours on disk 3, that's not rushing";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:42 PM;He's doing *something*;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:42 PM;I'm following a damn spoiler free walkthrough so I don't miss any items;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:42 PM;I can't be doing something wrong;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:42 PM;wait 22 hours on disc 3 or 22 to get to disc 3 either way woooow lol;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:42 PM;That's not how any of the other FF games I played works;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:43 PM;have you tried venturing off and doing chocob forest or anything;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:43 PM;That's called grinding then;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:44 PM;And I said it's the first game I had to grind to progress;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:44 PM;not really grinding its getting great weapons grinding is trying to lvl up in my mind;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:44 PM;Since when was doing sidequests grinding?;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:44 PM;thats what i mean lol;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:45 PM;i mean i can beat it without the sidequest but those weapons are amazing and i wouldnt want to;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:45 PM;...what sidesquests;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:45 PM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:45 PM;chocobo forest is a side quest its the hot and cold game it gives you toooooons of great items;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:46 PM;"I don't have time for this, if you want to be a jerk, that's fine, but don't try to call me stupid or a liar again.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 07:46 PM;"(that's not for you, Kayce)";;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:46 PM;ok lol i was like huh?;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 07:47 PM;but yeah the hot and cold side quest takes some time thought but is really worth it you can get weapons with great abilities like you can teach steiner beatrix's abilities shock and clinhazzard;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 07:52 PM;"I'm not being a jerk, I'm just saying you're doing *something* wrong if you had trouble against Amarant, your levels are early to mid 30's by disk 3, *and* you're 22-24 hours in, and still on disk 3.";;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 08:01 PM;im on disc 3 and my main team are between 34-38;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 08:03 PM;I just got past the desert and most of my team is at level 32;;
Marcello#4574;04-Dec-17 08:03 PM;Amarant and Quina are at 20~ though;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 08:49 PM;i dont really use amarant and i got quina earlier in the game so i was able to teach her blue magic early on;;
Kayce Jonera#2680;04-Dec-17 08:50 PM;you have to make sure you eat with quina and get alot of blue magic;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Dec-17 08:54 PM;Quina be like Feed me Seymour!;;
Aruu#2066;05-Dec-17 06:26 AM;Amarant can be tricky without the right set up on Zidane.;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 06:30 AM;Honestly Amarant is the only party member I don't think is worth it.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Dec-17 06:37 AM;"Thank you, Aruu.";;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 06:42 AM;I still think something is wrong with the rng for your encounter rate 🤷;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 06:42 AM;Maybe something a mod messed with or something.;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 06:42 AM;But you _are_ significantly underleveled.;;
Aruu#2066;05-Dec-17 07:07 AM;I feel bad for Amarant. He has so much potential but by the time you get him...;;
Malfred#1000;05-Dec-17 07:13 AM;I tend to use Amarant more than Steiner;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 08:04 AM;"If I have to use a tank that isn't Zidane, I'll use Freya.";;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 08:04 AM;But my party at endgame tends to be Zidane and all three mages.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Dec-17 08:15 AM;"Freya beat Ark by herself, so yeah, I'm keeping her for the time being lol";;
Malfred#1000;05-Dec-17 08:46 AM;"I usually go with Zidane, Amarant/Freya, Vivi, and Garnet.";;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 08:49 AM;I always do mostly magic teams;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 08:49 AM;it's damage-output hell for enemies.;;

Marcello#4574;05-Dec-17 09:43 AM;Which was the kind;;
Marcello#4574;05-Dec-17 09:43 AM;Makes sense;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 09:43 AM;Yeah;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 11:01 AM;It will forever be my headcanon that Quina raises Vivi's kids.;;
Aruu#2066;05-Dec-17 11:13 AM;And *doesn't* eat them;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 11:14 AM;^ yes;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 11:14 AM;(they try to eat one of them but one of the others is just like !!! quina no!!!);;
Aruu#2066;05-Dec-17 11:15 AM;'But you look so tasty!';;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 11:17 AM;... fine... Quina no eat. -pout-;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 11:42 AM;I just woke up and read ‘Quina’ as ‘Quistis’;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:16 PM;"FF8 OP, pls nerf";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:17 PM;Ff8 was not properly balanced at all. Try FF8 Requiem for a serious challenge;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:17 PM;"Rikku also OP, pls nerf";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:18 PM;Its a difficulty mod that forces you to use the Junction system in its intended form while remaining balanced and hard;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:18 PM;That doesn't really tell me much;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:18 PM;Its hard to describe without spoiling details;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:19 PM;Good thing we're in Spoilers;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:19 PM;Oh yeah;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:21 PM;Well here lemme give you a brief summary. Imagine a world where in FF8 where you need to go out of the way to max out magic to buff your stats while also encouraging the use of GF abilities and magic in combat. Even items become useful;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:22 PM;Like instead of being of means of becoming overpowered you actually gain the correct amount of power to even stand a chance against tougher enemies. Example: Cerberus now has Auto Haste and Triple casts Ultima;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;damn;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;I'll take broken FF8;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;thank you very much;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;Yeah i had to re-fight Seifer 1 20 times;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;Which Seifer fight?;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;1;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:23 PM;damn;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:24 PM;Its never bullshit hard but it creeps up on you;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:25 PM;I think the only boss that was still relatively easy was Granaldo;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:26 PM;The Rajin and Fujin fight is the highlight of this mod;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:26 PM;heh;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:28 PM;You know how when you draw Pandemona Fujin goes down like ez cake. Not anymore. Your forced to draw Pandemona otherwise Tornado kills you but then she gains an attack that does massive damage on you;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:31 PM;And i know what your thinking why not absorb wind? A you cant by then B even if you could while she's junctioned she can cast Meteor;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 02:31 PM;Now the AI's broken;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Dec-17 02:33 PM;No there smart not broken;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:48 PM;wait who?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:48 PM;I mean none of the characters in 3 are memerable;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:48 PM;So you wouldn't be remiss in thinking the ffvi death was Shadow;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:48 PM;But it was Banon;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:48 PM;She was a guest;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:51 PM;Oh!;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Dec-17 07:52 PM;"speaking of FF deaths, I had this crackpot theory that Baram never actually died, and that Baram actually became Kefka";;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:52 PM;I'll allow it;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:52 PM;I like Gogo-is-Darill even if it was debunked;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Dec-17 07:53 PM;"it made sense to me at the time, it was implied those villagers or whatever would do horrible horrible things to him if they caught him, I just assumed that made him insane, of course that conflicts with the orthodox theory about the magitek experiments making Kefka insane";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:53 PM;I also like Rinoa is Ultimecia;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:54 PM;See Rinoa is Ultimecia makes too much sense and that's why I plotted a fanfic around why it's untrue;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:56 PM;And Square will agree with you;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:56 PM;even though they've been known to lie before;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;05-Dec-17 07:58 PM;Ultimecia: I shall junction myself unto myass!;;
Treble#5035;05-Dec-17 07:58 PM;Yeah but the director straight up said he thought that one was dumb and that's rude.;;

Treble#5035;06-Dec-17 01:47 AM;All six are trapped in the arch;;
Treble#5035;06-Dec-17 01:47 AM;If all six attacked it would have prevented Edea injuring Squall and the entire Squall is Dead theory;;

Senteria#1902;06-Dec-17 04:49 AM;just like squall is dead;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:25 AM;People can believe what they want especially since there is no sequel to contradict it;;
Malfred#1000;06-Dec-17 05:35 AM;Rather people can consider it part of their fanon.;;
Malfred#1000;06-Dec-17 05:35 AM;"SE did express interest in the Squall is dead scenario, as described.. And just said that it wasn't their intention with the story.";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:36 AM;Well I suppose it's better it remains part of the fanon;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:36 AM;About to fight braska's final aeon can't remember if this fight was hard;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:36 AM;Ez;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:37 AM;Depending if you have any celestial weapons;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:37 AM;Shouldn't be that difficult because I have completed the sphere grid path for some characters and have one mp cost and plenty of gear;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:37 AM;So idk if it will be easy but shouldn't be that tough;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:37 AM;You should be fine;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:38 AM;"Gonna just spam buffs, healing spells, ultima, overdrives and have stoneproof since he can petrify you iirc";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:39 AM;He can't petrify you if  he's already dead;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:39 AM;Isn't his basic attack the petrify thing;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:39 AM;I forgot;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:40 AM;I just remember every time i fought him he did it a lot lol;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:41 AM;"Oh yeah, his jecht beam can petrify you";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;Ugh;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;WTF;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;Make sure you take down those floaty thingies;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;WHAT THE SHIT IS THIS;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;JESUS;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;ok i'm playing something else;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:42 AM;Didn't even get to the boss and I'm out;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:43 AM;huh;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:43 AM;celestial weapons make this boss super easy;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:43 AM;Kept fighting marlboro in the sin nucleus and it kept ambushing me and kicking off the fight with bad breath managed to escape a couple times but third time i just rage quit;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:43 AM;Forgot about the nucleus;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:43 AM;So went in without poison/confuse/whatever proof;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:43 AM;Oh damn;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:44 AM;You should try and get Auron's celestial weapon;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:44 AM;"It has first strike, that's a real lifesaver";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:44 AM;Gonna try again but equip the proofed equipment and just hope i can change equipment before the boss;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:45 AM;Hmm i just wanna finish the game atm;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:45 AM;"I can't remember much about that boss, sorry";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 05:46 AM;I could avoid the crystal things best i can;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 05:46 AM;It was like 5 turns and done for me;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:21 AM;Hmm;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:21 AM;Maybe i just need better gear and to fill the sphere grid some more;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:22 AM;I don't see why i'm finding this difficult when the rest of the game has been mega easy for me;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:22 AM;Have you made it to the boss yet?;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:23 AM;Yeah I got to the second form I didn't really make any serious errors it was just a straightforward game over;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:25 AM;Am I expected to actually have any celestial weapons or have anima/magus sisters for this fight;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:25 AM;Or is it possible to just walk in there and fight like any other ff final boss;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:25 AM;What are your stats like?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:25 AM;"Not really, it'd just make things easier";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:25 AM;is all I'm saying;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:25 AM;Cus i'm used to ff final bosses being easy lol;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:26 AM;Well final aeon isn't the final boss;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:26 AM;"Completed the sphere grid for tidus, lulu, auron, yuna, wakka";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:26 AM;Yeah i know yu yevon;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:26 AM;You should be golden then;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:26 AM;Well;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:26 AM;"I haven't completed the sphere grid, i just got to the end of their paths and continued to grind a bit";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:27 AM;"So lulu has doublecast & ultima, yuna has holy, etc";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:27 AM;Oh then those extra stats  won't really be of any use then;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:28 AM;"I just thought that with one mp cost on several characters, the best spells in the game and everyone already on their overdrive the boss would be a walk in the park";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:29 AM;Well you'd be hitting close to the damage limit;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:29 AM;But defence and stuff should still stack;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:30 AM;"I am hitting 9999 with tidus, auron and wakka every time lmao";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:30 AM;Like on paper everything should work but i can't seem to do it;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:31 AM;I need higher max hp;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:31 AM;That is probably what it amounts to;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:31 AM;What's ypu HP at?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:31 AM;*your;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;Auron is theonly one with 6000 iirc the game is closed wait a sec i'll load it up;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;Boi;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;Raise that HP;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;Lol;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;"His second form overdrive I think, hits for 5k";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;Yeah it does;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:32 AM;Plus that blade causes delay;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:33 AM;Ok tried to send an image of my party but for some reason it ain't uploading;;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:34 AM;"Auron - 6030, Wakka - 5079, Tidus - 5746, Kimahri - 4217, Yuna - 3087, Lulu - 2480 (lol), Riku - 4108";;
action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 06:35 AM;Thats how it looks as far as max hp goes;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:35 AM;At least so that they can take 5k and live;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:35 AM;Gotta pump up that HP;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 06:49 AM;use stamina tonics as well if you have them;;

action warrior#8892;06-Dec-17 07:00 AM;Lol;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;06-Dec-17 07:02 AM;I'd say get auto protect on your armour but then you might as well get some celestial weapons;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Dec-17 12:01 PM;"For your armor, you want at least three of them, per party member. The abilities you’re looking for are Auto Potion (get X-potions), Auto Haste, Auto Phoenix, Def +20%, and Ribbon or Stoneproof";;

Treble#5035;12-Dec-17 04:23 PM;"Approximately 30 years before the beginning of Final Fantasy VII, the Jenova Project was initiated to produce a human-Cetra hybrid using the cells from Jenova (mistaken to be a Cetra) and Mako Energy from the Planet. The result was Sephiroth, who, although not having the powers of a Cetra as originally intended, was a child with exceptional abilities. Shinra recognized his potential and a method was planned to mass produce more fighters of his type., , Using similar processes, Shinra exposed promising warriors to raw Mako giving their eyes the unique glow. Although eclipsed by Sephiroth, the new warriors, called SOLDIER, gained powers surpassing those of a normal combatant.";;

Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:49 AM;one day;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;CHIM is a state of all-knowing.;;
Leon#9542;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;please no;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;and have everyone realize they're inside of a video game;;
Leon#9542;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;please never Star Ocean;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;"The stars you see in the night sky of the TES games aren't stars, they're just other planes of Oblivion.";;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;That's actually neat but;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;the moons?;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;Achieved by witnessing The Godhead of the current Kalpa;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;Basically CHIM can't explained in layman's terms;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:50 AM;Because there'll always be something else to explain;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:51 AM;The moons are the remnants of the body of a dead god.;;
Leon#9542;13-Dec-17 11:51 AM;"Yeah, I'm looking at the wiki page for it now and it's just nonsense, haha";;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:51 AM;Oh and;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:51 AM;Don't use Elderscrollswiki for lore-related stuff;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;UESP is what you wanna use;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;"They're really good for game-related things, but for lore, UESP and TIL are the better options";;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;what is uesp;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;TIL is The Imperial Library;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;Oooh;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;I mean I'm not gonna go around reading TES lore.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;"TES isn't my favorite, if I had to choose I'd pick DA every time.";;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:52 AM;But it's neat to discuss.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:53 AM;It is one hell of a rabbit-hole;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:53 AM;The deeper you go into TES lore the weirder it gets.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:53 AM;Yuuup;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:54 AM;You reach a point where you just stop looking into it because it gets *too* weird and starts ruining the games.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:54 AM;Every living thing was once the same beings;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:54 AM;Some got caught in  a plan to instigate mortality and creativity;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:54 AM;And those eventually split into elves and humans;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:54 AM;The gods actually hate mortalkind and really only support them against the Daedra because mortals contain a sliver of the Aedra's power.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:55 AM;The only race (that we know of) that wasn't created by these events are the Argonians;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:55 AM;"But the Daedra aren't really evil, it's just a catch all phrase for beings on god level that didn't make the mortal plane.";;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:55 AM;Daedra and Aedra are essentially the same anyway;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;They just consist of different types of energies;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;Aedra literally means Our ancestors and Daedra means Not our ancestors;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;Aren't the princes literally just the same between both pantheons?;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;But like;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;two different halves;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;Nah;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;No.  The Aedra are a set of Daedra that got tricked into making the mortal plane.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:56 AM;The princes are always the same and always Daedric;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:57 AM;And yet you have Magnus who is also an Aedra despite not being part of the creation of Mundus;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:57 AM;Are they really always the same though?;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:57 AM;Didn't the hero of kvatch replace one?;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 11:57 AM;this is so unnecessarily confusing.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:57 AM;Aedra consist of Anuic energies and Daedra consist of Padomaic energies.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;That's because god status can be inherited;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;It is called Mantling;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;And eventualy the one who inherits it will just become that god.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;Also there's Sithis;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;Who doesn't fit *anywhere*;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;You assume the aspect of the god and thus become the god;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;Yeah;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:58 AM;Sithis is either a third force (void/nothingness) or just another name of Padomay (change/chaos).;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:59 AM;As I said;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:59 AM;A rabbithole;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 11:59 AM;"The deeper you go, the less it make sense and the weirder it gets.";;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 11:59 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:00 PM;You might have heard of Akavir;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:00 PM;It is a described as another continent;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 12:00 PM;mess;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 12:00 PM;it's a mess;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:00 PM;Tamriel has been invaded by Akavirian armies multiple times;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:01 PM;Some notable people have even visited Akavir;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:01 PM;But;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:01 PM;The continent is just a future version of Tamriel.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:01 PM;Not actually another continent;;
action warrior#8892;13-Dec-17 12:01 PM;How future;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:01 PM;Similarly there's Atmora/Aldmeris;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:02 PM;"Which is yet another continent, where the ancestors of the Nords and Altmer came from";;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:02 PM;But it is simply a past version of Tamriel;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:02 PM;We don't know;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:02 PM;The universe itself reincarnates;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:02 PM;Each incarnation is referred to as a Kalpa;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 12:02 PM;what happened to the dwemer 🤔;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:03 PM;No one knows;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 12:03 PM;"We don't really know, but there's a couple theories.";;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:03 PM;Plenty of theories though;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 12:03 PM;They might have collectively achieved CHIM and disappeared;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:03 PM;They most likely just Nope'd out of existence;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 12:04 PM;Isn't there a questline in Skyrim or Oblivion where the NPC at the end disappears to wherever the Dwemer went?;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Dec-17 12:04 PM;I remember something like that.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 12:05 PM;Seems like a Skyrim thing;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:05 PM;I don't remember anything like that;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 12:05 PM;Since so much in Skyrim is Dwemer-ish.;;
Malfred#1000;13-Dec-17 12:05 PM;Just a few getting kidnapped by Daedra.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Dec-17 12:12 PM;"`Isn't there a questline in Skyrim or Oblivion where the NPC at the end disappears to wherever the Dwemer went?, I remember something like that.`, , Not the same place, but it is in Skyrim";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Dec-17 12:12 PM;the Skyrim NPC sort of entered into the being of the Dragonborn;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Dec-17 12:13 PM;becoming a metaphysical covering of sorts;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Dec-17 12:13 PM;whereas the Dwemer collectively became the metaphysical skin of Numidium;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Dec-17 12:13 PM;"basically becoming a god, which is what they wanted";;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:35 PM;Ignis' DLC got me thinking;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:35 PM;about how uninteresting Noctis is as a main character;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:36 PM;Noctis was supposed to be interesting?;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:37 PM;atleast its what one assumes from his main character;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:37 PM;"or expect ;)";;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:37 PM;He's not on the level of Vaan so thank god for that;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:38 PM;Vaan wasn't the mc though;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:38 PM;He was just who you started the story as.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:38 PM;XV was definitively about Noctis who is very disinteresting on the whole.;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:39 PM;true that;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:39 PM;Although wasn't it all started by Basch/Reks?;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:39 PM;Reks technically.;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:39 PM;also i read somewhere Basch was supposed to be the mc;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;I think it's pretty heavily debated who the MC is.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;Between Basch and Ashe.;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;before comitee and studio meddlig;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;"Basch is least likely,";;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;I've heard both were meant to be and both have the story capacity for it.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;Ashe edges Basch out though.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;I can see Ashe;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;and maybe Balthier;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;but not Basch;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;Particularly because if it's Ashe they did the same thing with XIII.;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;her arc surely resembles one worthy of mc;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;She's also the mc of the manga.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;SO yeah;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:40 PM;It's more than likely Ashe.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:41 PM;"On a similar note, Yuna's the MC of X";;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:41 PM;yeah. Sorry Tidus;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:41 PM;this isnt Your Story;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:41 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:42 PM;Yeeep.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:42 PM;They basically did the same thing for three games.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:42 PM;"10, 12, and 13?";;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:42 PM;Take a female (or feminine in XIII's case) character and tell their story through the eyes of a male or masculine character.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:42 PM;Yep.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:43 PM;"who's story is it in 13, if not LIght's?";;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:43 PM;Vanille's;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 05:43 PM;And how is she masculine?;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:44 PM;She's the feminine one.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:44 PM;Light driving the narrative replaced her.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:44 PM;Except Vanille managed to maintain narration.;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 05:47 PM;The entire XIII series was marketed with Lightning as the protag but the only time she ever actually _was_ the protag was in LR.;;
Mr.BudGuy#6138;13-Dec-17 05:49 PM;man I need to replay XIII now;;
Aura#2896;13-Dec-17 06:01 PM;I never actually beat XIII despite playing XIII-2 to hell and back;;
Treble#5035;13-Dec-17 06:02 PM;You should sometime. I think you'd lie it.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Dec-17 06:04 PM;VS truthing it;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Dec-17 08:53 PM;There’s an alt ending?;;
Treble#5035;15-Dec-17 08:53 PM;Episode Ignis supplied a new ending where everyone other than Luna lives;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;15-Dec-17 08:55 PM;I’m waiting for the pc version to replay;;
Treble#5035;15-Dec-17 08:55 PM;in before episode luna happens and is literally the entire game but luna is the protagonist;;
Treble#5035;15-Dec-17 08:55 PM;ngl i'd play that before normal xv;;
👌RuMcK#0520;15-Dec-17 08:58 PM;Same here bro;;
Aura#2896;15-Dec-17 09:01 PM;That'd be fun. I'm sure I'd be more invested in her as a character then.;;
Treble#5035;15-Dec-17 09:02 PM;The only reason I'm invested i Luna at all is Kingsglaive.;;
Treble#5035;15-Dec-17 09:02 PM;She was just a walking plot device in xv.;;
Aura#2896;15-Dec-17 09:03 PM;I never watched Kingsglaive so I never really got Luna as a character;;
Treble#5035;15-Dec-17 09:03 PM;"You should, especially if you like XV.";;

fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 02:53 AM;so in the end ignis and noctis and the gang somehow manage to defeat arydn completely without noctis dying at all?;;

fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 02:57 AM;really?  i heard some people said stuff like they found a way to kill adryn completely without needing to sacrfice noctis at all;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 02:57 AM;🤔;;
Deleted User#0000;16-Dec-17 02:57 AM;I don't think so. Ardyn did say that he would come back;;

fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 02:57 AM;hmm true;;

fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:01 AM;probably start the bullshit of how he was betrayed and all that stupid shit;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:01 AM;i thinking that how is the episode will start ^ XD;;
Deleted User#0000;16-Dec-17 03:01 AM;All I know is that he was cursed by the Crystal since it deemed him unworthy;;

fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:02 AM;hmm i read that it was cuz he took on the sins of others;;
Deleted User#0000;16-Dec-17 03:02 AM;Oh right;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:02 AM;only then the crystal deemed him unworthy;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:02 AM;cuz he was a healer;;
Deleted User#0000;16-Dec-17 03:02 AM;He healed Daemons right;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:03 AM;he healed by taking on other's sins;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:03 AM;he healed people who were abt to be corrupted;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:03 AM;the only way to return them back to human he had to take on their sins;;
fredkang12#6969;16-Dec-17 03:03 AM;so in turn he healed by gathering in too much of that dark energy;;
Deleted User#0000;16-Dec-17 03:04 AM;"```, Two thousand years ago, Ardyn Lucis Caelum was to be the first Lucian king. He believed he was chosen by the Crystal to save Eos from the Starscourge, a malady that transforms people into daemons. He did so by absorbing the Starscourge into his own body to protect his subjects. While his actions saved thousands across the world, he was rejected by the Crystal as tainted, and was denounced by the Astrals and his ascendance to the throne was denied. He was barred entry to the Astral Realm since the daemons he had absorbed rendered him immortal. He became demonized by his brother, who would become the Founder King. As the fallen King of Light, Ardyn took the surname of Izunia (which he implies later on was chosen in direct relation to the king who demonized him) and plotted to one day end the Astral-appointed bloodlines of the Lucian kings and Tenebraean Oracles, alongside their divine artifacts.```";;

Doctor_Vile#6548;17-Dec-17 05:20 AM;You forget sin has the most powerful armour in the game - plot armour;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 09:01 AM;Why did no one else think about going inside sin before tidus and friends;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:24 AM;Because why would you and how would you?;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:24 AM;Also they were fine with accepting that the Final Summoning was IT;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:24 AM;The end all be all;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:24 AM;Until Yuna was like biiiiitch;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 09:33 AM;How would you even get into Sin?  The only way Tidus/Yuna are able to do it is because of the airship the Al Bhed had found.  Plus no one really understood what Sin was or how it functioned.  The reason Tidus/Yuna knew to go inside of Sin was because of what the Fayth and Yunalesca had told them.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:34 AM;Yep.;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:34 AM;It was entirely a matter of perfect timingm;;
Treble#5035;17-Dec-17 09:34 AM;Though that also does imply that Bevelle could have defeated Sin a thousand years ago if they'd had the know how.;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:46 AM;Ok how about this;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:46 AM;How did jecht leave dream zanarkand;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:46 AM;"He got too close to Sin, right?";;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:46 AM;Idk;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;I actually don't remember it being explained;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;Well Dream Zanarkand actually exists on a physical level;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;Yeah i know but;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;Why did he leave and how;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;So I think Sin got too close to the 'dream' and Jecht was able to latch on.;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;Like if it was that easy to just leave idk why he would be the first to do it;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:47 AM;Hmm;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:48 AM;"Weren't they compelled to stay? Or wasn't the fiends/Sin a way to keep them inside? Jecht being Jecht, was stubborn.";;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:48 AM;Or he just got lucky. How many more people went missing and seemingly 'died' when they actually just found a way out?;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:49 AM;Since there's no way back and all.;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:49 AM;I know it's a physical place near baaj temple;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:49 AM;But idk about the whole leaving and coming back thing;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:50 AM;There must be a way back because didn't auron get back there;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:50 AM;Auron rode on Jecht!Sin;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:50 AM;it was the only way to get Tidus out;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:51 AM;Auron only survived because he was already dead.;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:51 AM;Tidus was able to get out though because hew as going the other way;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:52 AM;I know all that lol;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:52 AM;Just wondering how jecht managed it;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:52 AM;Since only reason sin got to dream zanarkand was because jecht was making that happen;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:52 AM;So why would sin be there for jecht to hitch a ride;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:53 AM;"By chance maybe? Sin got close enough, and Jecht got lucky.";;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 10:53 AM;I guess i'll just have to accept that jecht happened to get out by chance lol;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:53 AM;I think that's it. Or he was just that determined to see what was out there;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:56 AM;Sin can relocate people somehow.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:56 AM;The game never goes into it.;;
Leon#9542;17-Dec-17 10:56 AM;whale magic;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:56 AM;Wasn't dream zanarkand or atleast the one Tidus and Jecht know just a memory of the real version;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:57 AM;But Sin moves the whole party from macalania to Bikanal desert;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:57 AM;It was a real physical city.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:57 AM;That was based on the memory of what Zanarkand used to be.;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:57 AM;It's never explained in game mind.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:57 AM;That's what I meant;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 10:58 AM;"Tidus and Jecht don't exist in the actual zanarkand, only the memory of it";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 10:59 AM;"Yes, but the memory is a real physical thing.  Sin doesn't move Jecht/Tidus between dimensions or anything like that, it picks them up and drops them off elsewhere in Spira.";;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 10:59 AM;"'Although not stated outright, it is possible that the citizens of Dream Zanarkand are made in the image of the people who used to live in the original Zanarkand; as the cityscape is born of the fayth's collective memories, it may mean the citizens are as well. The Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission Ultimania posits that Dream Zanarkand was created as the ideal representation of Zanarkand, a wish given form. Since the original Zanarkand was the model for everything in Dream Zanarkand, this extends to its inhabitants, who would marry one another and have children, continuing the cycle of life. Thus the genes of Dream Zanarkand's inhabitants blended to form a unique populace.'";;
Deleted User#0000;17-Dec-17 11:00 AM;"So naturally, Tidus is most likely Shuyin's dream";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:00 AM;More likely he's the descendent of Shuyin's dream.;;
Deleted User#0000;17-Dec-17 11:00 AM;"It's not stated if they can have children or not, or is it?";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:00 AM;Considering that Dream Zanarkand was an actual living city for just as long as Sin.;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:00 AM;"Not in game, but the Ultimania might say it.";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:01 AM;"Since the original Zanarkand was the model for everything in Dream Zanarkand, this extends to its inhabitants, who would marry one another and have children, continuing the cycle of life. Thus the genes of Dream Zanarkand's inhabitants blended to form a unique populace.'";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:01 AM;From Aruu's quote above.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:01 AM;Dream Zanarkand's citizens were functionally normal people.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:02 AM;Hmmmmmmmm;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:02 AM;The game does a really poor job of explaining *anything* about Dream Zanarkand.;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:02 AM;You really need the Ultimania.;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:03 AM;Especially since it barely clears up whether Tidus is from the past or not;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:03 AM;So is the zanarkand that we find Yunalesca in;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:03 AM;The real deal or the dream place;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:04 AM;Idek if there's much of a difference since both were destroyed anyway;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:04 AM;The REAL place.;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:04 AM;The one that dream Zakarkand is based on.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:04 AM;Ah ok;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:05 AM;The ruins are the real place and Yunalesca is hanging out there to get summoners to continue sacrificing themselves;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:06 AM;See I wish the game did a better job at explaining it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:07 AM;Along with other stuff;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:08 AM;"FF games have a bad habit of not being fully explained. The early ultimanias are coming out in English, so hopefully the older games will eventually get them too";;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:08 AM;erm newer games;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:11 AM;"Dream Zanarkand and Real Zanarkand are two completely different dots on the map.  It is super confusing, I know.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:12 AM;The part that makes it confusing is that the game never acknowledges that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:13 AM;Either that or nobody knows;;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:13 AM;"Plus there's the weird, psuedo half Zanarkand inside Sin where Jecht resides.";;
Dinoken2#0946;17-Dec-17 11:13 AM;Game is awful and explaining the differences.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:13 AM;Oh yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:13 AM;Forgot about that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:14 AM;Originally that's what I thought Tidus came from;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:14 AM;I always thought he came from ruined!Zanarkand but got sent to the future.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:16 AM;I think what would've been clear if the others knew that there were two of the same place coexisting;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:16 AM;But that begs the question;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:16 AM;How far away were they;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:16 AM;That no one knew the dream one existed;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:16 AM;Dream Zanarkand is slap bang in the middle of the ocean.;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:16 AM;I think its protected too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:17 AM;Protected in a sense that it is invisible?;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:17 AM;Plus few people would willingly go out there because of Sin;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:17 AM;Sin's taught them to stay close to land;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:18 AM;I like to think so. Or people are just compelled to not go near it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:18 AM;That's some Touhou type shit lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Dec-17 11:18 AM;There's a character who is capable of doing such things;;
Aruu#2066;17-Dec-17 11:19 AM;"It's complicated, yes!";;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 11:19 AM;Dream zanarkand is located near baaj temple;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 11:19 AM;Real zanarkand is where you see it on the map;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 11:19 AM;I presume dream zanarkand is like underwater;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 11:20 AM;With some kind of giant sphere thing around it so it's not submerged kind of like the underwater city in star wars phantom menace;;
action warrior#8892;17-Dec-17 11:20 AM;Because if not then literally everyone would know it exists;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:45 PM;how long have you been playing holy shit lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:45 PM;Like... 103 hours last time I saved;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:45 PM;"damn dude, it took me ages to get that far";;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:46 PM;I've heard this is when P5 goes full SMT: Nocturne on us;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:46 PM;maybe a little;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:46 PM;most people complained about the lack of save points;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:47 PM;they're spread out between each section;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:47 PM;"but yeah, depths is actually one of my fav parts of the game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:47 PM;especially the music;;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:47 PM;I can see why;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:47 PM;it is called Freedom and Security if you wanted to listen to it out of game btw;;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:48 PM;"Great music that fits the mood of everyone in here, creepy fractals, it has the works";;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:49 PM;"Everyone here is so... resigned, holy shit.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:50 PM;It gets even better from there;;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:51 PM;"I'm at the part where we run into Kamoshida, Madarame, Kaneshiro, and Shido";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:51 PM;"and for those who played the previous games, we got a nice surprise about why a certain character sounds the way they do";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:51 PM;yeah that's fairly close;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:51 PM;you don't have much left;;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:52 PM;"Well that's pretty short then, if I'm close to the end";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:52 PM;if you are planning on doing NG+ and completing all of your confidants I suggest you rack up as much money as possible so that you can get your Personas back in NG+;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:52 PM;You don't have to do it at this moment;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:53 PM;there's still a tiny little dungeon after the depths that will work just fine for farming (a bit on the harder side but still);;
Seymour#0747;23-Dec-17 11:53 PM;Freedom & Security's a great song;;
Davkilla101#0932;23-Dec-17 11:53 PM;"Holy fuck, so the Palace rulers escaped from this place?";;
Seymour#0747;23-Dec-17 11:54 PM;It took me like a month to beat P5;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:54 PM;they kinda did that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:54 PM;something something their desires were too strong I think;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:55 PM;but the general idea is basically mementos is the root of them all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:56 PM;it piggybacks off of the TV World from P4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Dec-17 11:56 PM;which is almost the exact same thing;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:03 AM;"Ah, so there's a bit of continuity between games then?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:04 AM;somewhat;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:04 AM;"though P5, as fun of a game that it is";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:05 AM;played it overly safe and you'll definitely find stuff that feels like they just ripped it out of P4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:05 AM;like the whole Akechi thing;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:05 AM;and the Palaces;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:05 AM;etc...;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:08 AM;I see;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:11 AM;The good news is that none of that ruins either game regardless of which one you play first;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:11 AM;"I was thinking of playing P3 after this, actually";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;I give them a pass on it just for the simple fact that they still made a great game while going through development issues for years;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;if you play P3;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;you have a few options on how to do that;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;Play FES;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;2 in particular actually;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;FES or Portable;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:12 AM;both are different;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:13 AM;both have their own ups and downs;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:13 AM;Portable is great for the female protagonist option;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:13 AM;But that's about it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:13 AM;Portable has that and a better combat system;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:13 AM;I think a few more personas and other differences too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:14 AM;the problems with it though;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:14 AM;it lacks all of the original cutscenes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:14 AM;and is now designed like a visual novel;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:14 AM;"Well, I don't mind VNs, actually";;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:14 AM;"Boon or bane depending on preference, that last one";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:15 AM;FES is pretty much the original game just updated to be more balanced and includes a new mini-sequel story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:15 AM;"personally, I think the sequel thing was bad";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:15 AM;like we could've lived without it;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:15 AM;It is;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:16 AM;so I just barely count it as a positive;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:16 AM;"the main idea for FES though, is that it is better than the original P3";;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:16 AM;"But the new personae are great, slightly less rng is also a decent upgrade";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:16 AM;and with the exception of P3P removing cutscenes in place of VN styled ones;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:16 AM;it does everything FES did but better;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:17 AM;But it is a PSP game;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:18 AM;Which again... Can be a boon or bane;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:18 AM;Holy shit Morgana...;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:18 AM;So you weren't human;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:18 AM;the original is a PS2 game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:18 AM;so I don't really get the point you're trying to make;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:18 AM;"Yes, but you can get it on PSN legally";;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:19 AM;"Last I checked, you can't get P3P on the Vita";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:19 AM;lol;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:19 AM;Ah yes;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:20 AM;I keep forgetting that US get favorable treatment;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:20 AM;"No, that was badly worded..";;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:20 AM;You're not from the US?;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:20 AM;No.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:21 AM;I think all 3 of the PSP Persona games are on PSN;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:21 AM;and thus compatible with a Vita;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:21 AM;or atleast for NA that is the case;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:21 AM;didn't know it was different for other regions;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:23 AM;it's fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:24 AM;"on that note, it is nice to know that you can play almost all of the games with the exception of P5 and PQ";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:24 AM;all on one platform;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:24 AM;Very;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 12:26 AM;the result of a platform only being supported by japan;;

Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:45 AM;Oh hey;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:45 AM;At least he's on a chariot;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:46 AM;The original artwork/sprite for Mara was quite literally a dick and balls with some tentacles at the root;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:46 AM;"I just wonder who came up with that, lol";;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:47 AM;It suits Mara's lore in a weird way;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:50 AM;Well.. not the Chariot;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:51 AM;But I'm almost certain that it was only added to make Mara's true form slightly less obvious;;
Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 12:52 AM;It's still a giant dick though;;
Malfred#1000;24-Dec-17 12:53 AM;It is;;

Davkilla101#0932;24-Dec-17 09:24 PM;"It's a beast track, and the fact that they use it as the boss theme for Shido and the Holy Grail is 👌";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 09:27 PM;but anyway get on with that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 09:28 PM;FES if you want to see the game in its original glory or Portable if you want the updated combat and social links;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 09:28 PM;(plus the female MC option which is the first and only game to do this);;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 09:31 PM;yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 09:32 PM;they're kinda disconnected from the first three games;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;24-Dec-17 09:34 PM;It's more that the story was just a little more lighthearted;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:22 PM;since all of the mainline titles have had ports to the PSP except for Persona 4 which had a port to the Vita called Persona 4 Golden;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:22 PM;and in all of these situations the ported version was superior;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:22 PM;though P3P is arguable because of the differences;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:25 PM;"OH, that reminds me";;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:26 PM;I tried out both FES and P3P briefly to see which version I want to play.;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:26 PM;"I honestly don't like P3P's VN format, which is weird since I normally like VNs";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:27 PM;Generally that is the argument for deciding which version to play;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:27 PM;"in all other aspects, P3P is better (maybe some people liked fusion spells being OP idk)";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:28 PM;"includes battle system changes from P4 (controlling all party members, weakness gives an extra turn, blocking)";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:28 PM;more balanced social links;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:28 PM;slightly updated dialogue and the highlight feature;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:28 PM;"Also, for a game, I'd rather move about in a 3D space when I'm not in a dungeon";;

Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:28 PM;Though I will bemoan how janky the graphics of FES look;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:29 PM;FES on the other hand is more of a small improvement over the original;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:29 PM;socials are a bit more reasonable;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:29 PM;but still can be harsh in terms of the social stat requirements needed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:29 PM;"like for example, a party member in which you see for the entire game";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:30 PM;requires max intelligence;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:30 PM;before you can start their social link;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:30 PM;so don't expect it to be as laid back as P5 was with requirements and the amount of opportunities you have to increase your stats;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:31 PM;Jesus;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:32 PM;"I know that Haru requires max proficiency to start her link, but she's a late game social link, so that's fine";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:32 PM;yeah P3 is brutal with requirements;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:32 PM;even with FES and P3P's changes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:32 PM;still harder than the other games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:35 PM;"but yeah, as far as whether or not FES or P3P. I will say go with whichever one is most tolerable. P3P is still great for those who have played the game already and want to see the game from a different perspective with the female MC and updated gameplay mechanics";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:36 PM;But I totally get wanting to go through the game in its original(close to original) glory with FES since some scenes do lose part of their impact when it is just a bunch of cutin art with a backdrop;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:37 PM;And not even good art either;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:39 PM;have fun with Mitsuru and her Marin Karin shennanigans;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:40 PM;dealing with AI only is a test of patience;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:41 PM;you have no choice in vanilla P3 and FES;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:41 PM;AI or nothing;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:42 PM;So you can't turn off AI?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:43 PM;no;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:43 PM;you issue generic orders to them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:43 PM;and that's it;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:43 PM;"Well, fuck";;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:43 PM;That's going to be annoying;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:43 PM;in P3P Atlus brought in the changes that they made in P4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;which did give you the ability to manually control them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;along with a few other notable changes;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;That's...;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;A hell of a choice to make;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;that's why I said FES vs P3P is an arguable decision;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;P3P lacks the polish and quality of the original game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:44 PM;but improves in every other aspect;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:45 PM;FES has that original design but the original designs are still flawed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:45 PM;pick your poison;;
Davkilla101#0932;27-Dec-17 09:45 PM;"SO I either pick the one with the original cutscenes and the ability to walk around in 3D but no option to go full manual, or I pick the option with bad art and no option to walk around outside the dungeons but it gives me full manual";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:46 PM;pretty much;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:46 PM;also the art is the same between them;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:46 PM;that's the most generalized summary between the two;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Dec-17 09:47 PM;"if you watch it, there's no point in watching the game";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:14 AM;TZA/The International version;;
Dinoken2#0946;28-Dec-17 12:14 AM;Zodiac Spear in the original was missable if you opened the wrong chests.;;
Dinoken2#0946;28-Dec-17 12:14 AM;Not sure how you get it in TZA;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:15 AM;"Well, at least it's not a stupid time limit";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:15 AM;I spent 4 hours bashing my head against the ground for a few items;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:15 AM;"random, repeatable drop that has a 1% chance of showing up (you can minuplate it with some weird RNG) or by doing the Rare Game Hunts";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:15 AM;Literally;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:15 AM;(Chocobo sidequest);;
Leon#9542;28-Dec-17 12:16 AM;Seitengrat is much much worse to get in XII than the Zodiac Spear ever was;;
Leon#9542;28-Dec-17 12:16 AM;"you have to enter a specific area over and over again for a 1% chance of an invisible chest spawning, then that chest has a 0.01% chance of having the Seitengrat in it";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:17 AM;"My point with Excalibur II, is it's meant for a challenge. What's the point of getting the award for a challenge, if you're not going to do the challenge?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:17 AM;You didn't accomplish anything;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:18 AM;"And yet, you're expecting some grand reward for doing nothing";;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 12:19 AM;Sword should have broken once you got it;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:19 AM;It's a challenge to see if you are fast enough at beating a game;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:20 AM;And just that;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:26 AM;"“Sword should have broken once you got it” Why stop there? Why not have the game corrupt your save file for getting to the end so quickly?, , Also, Marcello you’re missing the whole point of a challenge. And not just challenges in general, but the Excalibur II challenge.";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:27 AM;Not really;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:28 AM;"Rushing through the game, missing many other important stuff, probably getting frustrated because you suck in battles at low level, maybe reseting, ...";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:28 AM;"This sounds good, right?";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:28 AM;There is no real incentive to get the sword;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:28 AM;And doing the challenge doesn't seem enjoyable **at all**;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:29 AM;"Anyway, Ozma should be next";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:29 AM;"I've reached the end of Memoria, so I think I'm going to tie some loose ends";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:30 AM;You going to cheat your way with Ozma?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:30 AM;Make his HP 1?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:30 AM;Also there are those who enjoy the challenge;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:30 AM;Maybe;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:31 AM;It depends on how much grinding it takes to beat it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:31 AM;Hell there are those who have made the challenge *more* challenging;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:31 AM;"Knowing you, you might as well cheat Ozma";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:31 AM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;Possibly;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;You like grinding to max?;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;"If I can't beat it with my current stats or it will take a long time to get ready, then yes, I am going to cheat it";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;Then cheat;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;Just like I did with Emerald/Ruby in VII;;
Aura#2896;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;As long as you have the right set-ups it's a fun challenge;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;Not because I don't like a challenge;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:32 AM;But I don't have the time to grind that much;;

Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:34 AM;"Oh, and also the jumping bs";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:34 AM;"Trust me, you’re currently not ready for Ozma";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:35 AM;And it’ll take quite some time to set up;;

action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 12:50 AM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661 the sword breaking would be symbolic;;

Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:53 AM;...;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 12:53 AM;I just question the purpose of the weapon if you get it that late game;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 12:54 AM;...;;

Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:59 AM;He calls the dude's opinion shit;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 12:59 AM;And then tells him to drop it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 01:00 AM;"It should be dropped because it's going nowhere, and you decide to randomly bring it back up again";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:01 AM;"I didn't, I just expressed my hate towards these kinds of challenges lol";;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:01 AM;And you got triggered;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:01 AM;I genuinely wanna know the purpose of it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Dec-17 01:01 AM;just drop it;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:01 AM;The sword breaking was me talking crap but i do actually wanna know;;

Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:02 AM;but no;;

action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:04 AM;Lmao;;

action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:05 AM;I already said that was just me talking out my ass about the sword breaking but i kinda wish it did just so people realised how useless it all is;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:05 AM;@Marcello#4574 I mean finishing a secret area or superboss or whatever is cool;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:05 AM;Some people said the Ultima Weapon in FF II is pure crap;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:05 AM;Idk;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:06 AM;Like you go through hell to get that sword;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:06 AM;I only really know about the super weapons in 7-9;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:06 AM;And it seems more like a dev meme;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:06 AM;Not even in 8 really;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:06 AM;So just 7 and 9;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:07 AM;It's just that one weapon always made me wonder if it was a joke to see if people did it or not;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:07 AM;Almost seems like something dark souls would do;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:07 AM;there is no weapon named that in the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:07 AM;only the boss;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:07 AM;what people complained about was the magic spell Ultima;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:08 AM;which had shitty damage;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:08 AM;In ff2?;;

Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:09 AM;Ah;;
Marcello#4574;28-Dec-17 01:09 AM;So it's the spell;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:09 AM;"I kinda wanna play it again, i just found it jarring at the time";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:09 AM;you have to go through a lot of trouble to get it to deal reasonable amounts of damage;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:09 AM;not worth it;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:09 AM;When i was like 12 playing origins on ps1 it seemed weird;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:10 AM;But i think i would approach it with an open mind today;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:11 AM;"yeah, the way it worked was that the spell's damage is based on the levels of all weapons and magic spells combined";;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:11 AM;What do you need to do to get it;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:11 AM;Just fight mega hard bosses?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:12 AM;"so as you would guess, not having everything at high enough levels would give you crap damage but nothing in the game is worth grinding your ass off to get it to become powerful";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:14 AM;I forgot how you got it but it was tedious nonetheless;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:14 AM;especially in the original NES version in which the spell did not function as it should;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;28-Dec-17 01:14 AM;thus always dealt poor damage no matter what;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:31 AM;I never played the nes version of any of those games;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:32 AM;I didn't realise weapons and magic had levels in that game either;;
action warrior#8892;28-Dec-17 01:32 AM;Like the mechanics of that game just seemed weird all round;;

I have Barts switch between Ninja, Mystic Knight, and now Samurai. Lenna as White Mage/Summoner. Galuf as Red Mage/Thief (and when I get him back, I'll have him focus as a Dragoon/Thief).

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;31-Dec-17 12:29 AM;"The game uses a table of pre-randomized values from 0-255 that change whenever specific animations are played. For example, whenever the animation of Curaga is played, the hexidecimal value Slot pulls from will increase by 38. If Curaga is used with the assumption that the Hex value is at 0, this will allow the use of Mega Flare, Summon, and Dive Bomb. However, the player will still have to press the button at the right time to stop the spinning reels, which isn't a problem by pausing and unpausing the game during the spinning.";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;31-Dec-17 04:24 PM;most people don't know it's possible for him to survive until they're told;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 04:24 PM;welp;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 04:24 PM;we told you to wait many times lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;31-Dec-17 04:25 PM;this is also why you should always make multiple saves;;
Aura#2896;31-Dec-17 06:13 PM;Creating back up saves is always good.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Dec-17 06:14 PM;So are save states;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:17 PM;Save states are the closest you can get to cheating lol;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:18 PM;"I admit using save states in Resident Evil 2, but I deeply regret doing it";;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:18 PM;i used save states for megaman X1 all the way to X6;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:18 PM;I'm fine with that;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Dec-17 06:19 PM;Im fine with them in general;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;i use them on platforming games;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;because you die a lot on those;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;don't really bother with save states on any other type of game;;
Aura#2896;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;I never have had issues with save stats;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;especially now when I don't always have the luxury to save when the game lets me;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;Save states can really break the tension in Resident Evil games;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:20 PM;Like;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:21 PM;"Oh, I got hit by a zombie, I'll just load a state";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:21 PM;"Oh, I don't know what's there, I'll risk it, no prob";;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:22 PM;"That's why I don't usually use save states, unless I'm doing like a TAS or something";;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:22 PM;"Actually, I'm pretty sure that's what save states are for, TAS and speedrun practice";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;And Pokemon games;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;i wish i had savestates on Bully to help me with speedrunning;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;Don't forget about the Pokemon games lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;"Oh right, for when you're trying to capture the legendary dogs";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;I think there are tools for the PC version of Bully that allows you do to that;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;probably;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:23 PM;Or just need to spam Ultra balls;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;i just play the vanilla game;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;I remember spamming ultra balls with Ho-oh in SoulSilver;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;That's a good way of using up thousands of pokedollars;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;The motherfucker was 1hp and not even with 50 ultra balls I could catch him;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;I remember trying to capture Groudon in Omega Ruby;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;tfw no savestates on the DS;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;i had no master ball to capture lugia;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:24 PM;it hurt;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;Master balls are for the wild legendaries lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;"Used up all my ultra balls, and by some fluke I actually caught him in a regular pokeball";;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;yeah;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;i used mine on entei;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;I remember the hold B to increase your chances gimmick lol;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;I actually believed in that;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;Which didn't actually influence anything;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:25 PM;Weeeell...;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:26 PM;It worked a *few* times lol;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:26 PM;"Pure coincidence, obviously";;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:26 PM;The catch rate is dependent on the following: https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/20/Catch_formula_1.png;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:27 PM;"HP is like the biggest influence on the outcome, but some pokemon, like the legendary dogs and Abra, run away when you try to lower it";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:27 PM;"Wait, that doesn't seem right";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:28 PM;Or I'm way too dumb;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:28 PM;"Nope, I'm dumb, nevermind";;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:28 PM;That's the catch rate formula for Gen III and Gen IV;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:28 PM;I thought the higher the HP the higher your chances were lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;...;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;what;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;The game even tells you you have to lower HP to improve your chances;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;"No, I meant from that formula";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;That's why I thought it was weird;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;Just bad math right now lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;"The bigger the HP, the larger the denominator is";;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;math is for nerds;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:29 PM;NERDS!;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:30 PM;The denominator is constant though;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:30 PM;`3 x HP`?;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:30 PM;Yep;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:30 PM;"OH, never mind";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:30 PM;It's HP_max;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:30 PM;x3;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:31 PM;"Ok, so...";;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:32 PM;(3 x HP_max - 2 x HP_current);;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:32 PM;That's where lowering hp comes in;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:32 PM;"The less HP the pokemon has, the bigger the number you get out of this";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:32 PM;Yep;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:32 PM;I just thought it was the opposite at first sight lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:34 PM;"I imagine that `a` ends up being the probability of catching the pokemon, and the game generates a andom number, and if the number is equal to or less than `a`, it's a catch";;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:35 PM;"Otherwise, the game determines how far off it was, and uses that to determine the number of shakes before it releases the pokemon from the pokeball";;
T-Rog#9171;31-Dec-17 06:36 PM;Was I supposed to be able to get Terra back when I first meet her with the kids?;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:36 PM;"```cpp, a = prob();, , if ((rand()%101) / 100 > a) {,     catch();, }, ```";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:37 PM;This is usually how it goes;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:37 PM;no;;
mezzs#6465;31-Dec-17 06:37 PM;you'll get her later;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:38 PM;"That wouldn't compile though, lol";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;Just because catch is a keyword lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;I  guarantee the first error you'd get was that a was not declared in this instance;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;...;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;aww come on;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;"`int a = prob();`";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;"Anyway, that's how I did in a few projects";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;pleb;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:39 PM;That's just a snipped;;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:40 PM;It could have been declared before;;
Davkilla101#0932;31-Dec-17 06:40 PM;"We, the compiler, don't know that";;
Marcello#4574;31-Dec-17 06:40 PM;"Or, worse, it's global :LUVLUVLUVLUVLUV:";;

Cyto#4043;05-Jan-18 03:39 PM;That clarifies a lot. Thanks~;;
Aruu#2066;05-Jan-18 03:40 PM;No worries! It's never really told all that well;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 04:24 PM;FFVII Remake should be a PS5 launch title.;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 04:25 PM;Imagine that. The PS5 will be big as fuck if they do that;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 04:25 PM;the Ozzy Flea and Slash fight in CC;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 04:25 PM;is <3<3;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 04:25 PM;Nintendo Switch with Legend of Zelda BOTW as Launch? Hell naw. PS5 with FFVII Remake as the launch title;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 04:27 PM;"But if they actually do that. Shit, the PS5 will sell like crazy";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 04:27 PM;oh man would it ever;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 04:28 PM;Nintendo got cocky because the Switch is now the best selling console ever;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 04:28 PM;Not for long;;
Marcello#4574;05-Jan-18 04:40 PM;Wrong;;

Marcello#4574;05-Jan-18 04:41 PM;Fastest selling in a certain period of time;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 04:41 PM;Has the switch even outsold the PS4 or even come close to it;;
Marcello#4574;05-Jan-18 04:41 PM;It probably came close to Xbox One numbers though lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 04:42 PM;mind you they broke 1mil in less than 24hrs of launch;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 05:09 PM;@Aruu#2066 so basically right after the nibelheim incident they were captured for four years then cloud got away and spent a year in midgar then ff7 happens;;
Deleted User#0000;05-Jan-18 05:10 PM;Ah that explains **on that day 5 years ago**;;

Aruu#2066;05-Jan-18 05:13 PM;he probably was for a little while;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 05:46 PM;"`EU just limited what the films could do becayse they had to fit in with a continuity`, `They would have had to fit in with an established canon`, That's actually very incorrect, the original EU had several levels of canon, movies were considered G-canon, which was the highest level, the EU was C-canon, which was the third rung on the ladder, which means the movies could override the EU if they so desired, anything within the EU could have been declared non-canon if a movie contradicted it, it's just that occasionally Lucas decided to be accomodating";;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 07:58 PM;So why the outrage  @mrmiffmiff#0666;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 07:58 PM;Like who cares;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 07:58 PM;Boo hoo;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 07:59 PM;The films aren't aligned with the canon that you just said didn't mean anything anyway;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 07:59 PM;im reading  😃;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 07:59 PM;I wanna know why people care then;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;Bout the new films pissing on the EU;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;because people liked the EU;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;simple as that;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;and with good reason;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;But you just said it didn't amount to much;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;yea my man you are totally on point there;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;Even when it was canon;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;just because it wasn't *as* canon doesn't mean people didn't care about it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;i neglected to go into the levels of canon simply because thats a deep comversation;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;"like I said, Lucas was accomodating, the name Coruscant comes from the EU for example";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:00 PM;i think and i can only speak for the folks who ive talked to but;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:01 PM;it wasnt so much that they pissed on the EU;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:01 PM;"the fact is that even if they were considered less canon, they were still considered canon";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:01 PM;it was that for long lengths of time it was the EU and its under the movie levels of canon that kept the franchise alive;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:01 PM;not to mention that segments of the EU are low-key better than the movies;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:01 PM;and arguably expanded Lucas' vision to levels of immense depth;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:02 PM;100% agree;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:02 PM;like the Old Republic era;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:02 PM;"The Jedi Academy series, Thrawn, Dark Empire are hands down amazing";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:02 PM;yeah those are good too;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:02 PM;Dawn of the Jedi's another good one;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:02 PM;and for that reason i think you would find a lot of resonance in the EU fans;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:03 PM;KOTOR 2 is for me the pinnacle of what Star Wars could be;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:04 PM;the Clone Wars series is actually really good;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:06 PM;i know ppl who hate Dark Forces 1 and 2;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:06 PM;and i call them mutants;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:06 PM;XD;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:06 PM;those people are objectively wrong though;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:06 PM;hshs;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:07 PM;Its such a deeply layered universe and arguably as far as fantasy universes goes id say one of the deepest;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:07 PM;so its so hard to debate it all 😛;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:07 PM;"I just think that's life, I get that people were invested in it";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:07 PM;"though I will say this, I hate the secrets in Dark Forces 1, and 2 to an extent but those are much easier to find";;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:08 PM;You spent years immersing in it and it is now basically meaningless;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:08 PM;yea thats the best word to describe it investment;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:08 PM;exactly;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:08 PM;but i am trying to be objective its jsut too hard to seperate sometimes;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:08 PM;"I'd definitely agree it's one of the deepest (science) fantasy universes out there, , deeper than fucking Forgotten Realms";;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;"But my point is that star wars started as a film series and will be seen as mainly that to most people, they had to pretty much forget about the eu in the new films going forward";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;you say they had to;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;"but the fact is they *didn't* have to, they *chose* to";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;Lucas gave them scripts;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;as well;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;Okay so Episode 7 the EU is canon what happens;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;right after?;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:09 PM;No in ep7;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;Truce at Bakura i think?;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;What is the film about;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;oh;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;Pitch me episode 7 if the eu is canon;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;i couldnt;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;Why;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;Star Wars Episode III is my favourite Star Wars film;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;thats such a stacked question;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;I know it is;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;you would first have to deterine what event or part of the EU timeline you jump to;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;ot just go with direct chronology;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;Here we go;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:10 PM;ya know?;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;Everyone hates the prequels but I grew up with the prequels;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;It's getting convoluted already;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;"they probably would have to have forgotten all the post-movie EU if they wanted to do something brand new (not in itself necessary), yes, but why did they have to forget everything from before the movies too?";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;this is a conversation that would happen regardless;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;The Prequels are fucking awesome. Idc what anyone says;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;Ok before the movies i get i guess;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;have you ever done any creative writing?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;not a mean question;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;fyi;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;And the Prequels are far better than Episode 7 and 8;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;It's more the stuff after the original trilogy how do they deal wih a sequel trilogy if all that is canon;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;yeah it's definitely not convoluted to have to determine how far into the future you're going;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:11 PM;i mean i wrote a book;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;it took me 11 years;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;The New Star Wars trilogy is SJW crap;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;because of how much content i had to put doewn;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;and thats one book;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;imagine a universe spanning hundreds of collective works;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;tbh they should've just adapted the Thrawn trilogy;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;Exactly;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;George Lucas said Star Wars is always about the Skywalkers;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;saying tis too convulted is a cop out;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;@NerdintheNorth#2839 you just said jr;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;"George Lucas is a bad writer, so...";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;im tping to fast to edit my writing;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:12 PM;XD;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:13 PM;George Lucas is an amazing Storyteller;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:13 PM;The Prequels had great story but it was executed bad;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:13 PM;what did i say?;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:13 PM;The new trilogy is trash;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:13 PM;"yes, it was executed poorly because he's a bad writer";;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;He came up with amazing stuff;;
Silverx1987#9781;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;You can never type too fast.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;😛;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;the reason the original movie was so great? his wife told him what he did wrong in the script;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;the reason the rest of the OT was so great? he didn't write it;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;He still build an amazing universe;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:14 PM;Especially the prequels;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:15 PM;"I'd also remind you, It was George Lucas who decided to retcon Greedo shooting first in";;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:15 PM;"The Prequels had unique places, all of them were beautiful";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:15 PM;ofc no debate;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:15 PM;Not to mention they had the best Lightsabers in the entire Saga;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:15 PM;that was one of his key points of contention;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;"he wanted new aliens, new places, soething exciting in each new installment";;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;No movie will ever top Anakin Vs Obi Wan on Mustafar;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;there hasnt been anything else to compare it inside the movie universe;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;that fight is absolute shit;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;in comparison to some of the EU fights;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;XD;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:16 PM;"are you fucking kidding me, that lightsaber fight was far too stupid to take seriously, there was a point where they literally weren't trying to hit each other";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;ive seen fight disections fo that;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;its laughable;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;XD;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;I prefered the OT's visceral realistic swordplay to the prequels' over-choreographed fights;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;Okay that part was unnecessary but cool at the same time;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;me too 😛;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;That was the point tho. It was to showcase the Jedi in their prime;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;The Original trilogy had bad lightsaber fights;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:17 PM;in the context of the story;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;"Jedi in their prime, a warrior-monk in their prime would fight properly";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;they do not;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;not to look good;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;they are real;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;I'm sorry if I'm sounding really hostile;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;me too :{P;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;Darth Maul Vs Obi Wan and Qui Gon was badass;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;oh yea 😛;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:18 PM;okay I'll admit that fight was good;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:19 PM;Yoda Vs Darth Sidious;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:19 PM;Mace Winda Vs Palpatine;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:19 PM;and killing him;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:19 PM;❤;;
Silverx1987#9781;05-Jan-18 08:19 PM;"I don't know, I've watched too many Chinese Wushu series of the past while growing up. To be honest Star Wars wasn't much I haven't seen as a kid before. Not saying that it's bad or anything, but I think George Lucas might've gotten the inspiration from those sorts of series.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:20 PM;"nope, bad fight that last one, Mace Windu literally didn't do anything for the 10 seconds that Palpatine killed his comrades";;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:20 PM;good luck ever proving it 😛;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:20 PM;George Lucas made a space movie with Michael Jackson;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:20 PM;a good warrior like him should've been good at a collaboration fight;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:20 PM;i wasnt impressed with Palpy in the prequels;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:20 PM;Rey Vs Kylo Ren was stupid;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:21 PM;How tf does Rey beat Kylo;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:21 PM;so was the Praetorian guard fight;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:21 PM;imho;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:21 PM;Also Snoke is the dumbest name for a villain;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;"In the EU we got Darth Bane, Darth Revan etc";;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;Darth Caedus;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;Rey beat Kylo because he was shot in the side with a literal explosive bowcaster;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;she already had combat training;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;everything is so coincidental;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;admittedly not with a lightsaber but as injured as he was it worked out;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;to be believed;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;just like Rey;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:22 PM;again imho;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;it's definitely contrived but there is a realistic explanation for it;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;where?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;I just gave it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;in regards to the fight;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;oh;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;yea no;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;The real explanation is that SJWs dont want a girl to lose;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;i guess if you have to suspend disbelief;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;then you are right;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;Kite;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;but within the lore;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;that fight never ends with her winning;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:23 PM;Rian Johnson called out JJ Abrams on that in TLJ though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;everything wrong with the sequels can be traced to JJ;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;Both are them are shit;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;ok;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;im also a very strange person;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;Rian Johnson is worst;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;like for example;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:24 PM;if Donald Glover is Lando;;

Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:25 PM;It looks like a fanfic film;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:25 PM;absolutley;;

action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:34 PM;Would rather have had mass effect 4 be good;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:34 PM;yea;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:34 PM;that would have been amazing;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:34 PM;Yeah that was unfortunate;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:34 PM;Such a disappointment;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;i played 2;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;20 or more times;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;at least;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;I still think Andromeda's alright;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;One of the few times where i have been so disappointed that it has pissed me off;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;I loved ME3;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;Worse than ff13 disappointment imo;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;All the original trilogy were great games;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;Me2 is one of my favourite games ever;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;FF13’s disappointment wasn’t that bad;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:35 PM;Every franchise messes up once;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;@action warrior#8892  got mer #2 was the better of the 3;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;Like the Tales of series;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;yea thats a good example;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;some of them are fucking weird;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;XD;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;Yeah but ff13 was the first ff on those consoles and the series was still great coming off 12 imo;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;Legendia was atrocious 😛;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;to me;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;I just expected more from it;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:36 PM;"like half the Tales games are kinda bad, honestly";;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;or at least mediocre;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;The tales game i played on ps4 sucked ass imo;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;probably Zestiria;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;Only one i played;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;^;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;Yeah it was zesteria;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;Just felt too idk;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;I don't wanna say weeb;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;Lmao;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;Symphonia and Abyss were my #1 and 2;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:37 PM;But i can only imagine people who are so hardcore mega into anime and stuff liking that game;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;So into it they don't care for quality;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;All Tales games are heavily anime inspired;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;"nobody really likes Zesteria, haha";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;Zestiria was rushed so it wasn't fun for anyone;;

Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;"I thought it did characters alright, but everything else is just blah";;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;Probably Persona has the best use of Anime style;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;It was just everything i didn't like;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;Especially Persona 5;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;especially since they hyped up a character in the game who was only seen for a little while;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;then sold DLC;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:38 PM;That game oozes style;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;I thought the DLC was free?;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;Persona 5 is amazing so far i got it the other day;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;its oozed *A* style;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;LOL;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;For the time it was;;
action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;And it is my favourite game this gen tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;but not anymore;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;"Like if every JRPG could look like Persona 5, that’d be dope";;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;ohhh;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;oh god;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:39 PM;It was basically sorry for false advertisement;;

action warrior#8892;05-Jan-18 08:40 PM;Wind waker was my favourite zelda;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:40 PM;i played the Devil summonder series before Persona;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:40 PM;p3 was my enrty;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:40 PM;and once i saw 4 i thought i had descended into madness;;

Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:40 PM;I started on P4 lol;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;majority of them have never touched the previous games;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;since lets be real;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;Chie 😍;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;the reason you play P3- P5;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;"I started 4, but I go 3 > 5 > 2 > 4 > 1";;
Seymour#0747;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;wind waker has nice art;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;is nowhere near the reason why you would play P1 and both of P2 games;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:41 PM;indeed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;"P3 and above became more anime, more lighthearted, more casual, etc..";;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;Tokyo RPG Games have nice art;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;Like I Am Setsuna;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;moreso than Persona already was with the previous games;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;And the upcoming Lost Sphear;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;but Atlus took it to another level when P3 hit the scene;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;That's why there's such a disconnect between the fans as well(Atlus fans in general that is);;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:42 PM;i just read that sentence Like I am Setsuna instead i thought you wrote setsuma;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;i have spent too much time talking to Brits;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;can we all admit;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;i thought that read Like I am Setsuma;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;Xd;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;Setsuna was pretty boring;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;oh defintely;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;I enjoyed it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;the only thing I thought was cool was the music;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;nice music;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;but even that helped put me to sleep;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;as if the game wasn't doing that already;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:43 PM;"was nice to look at and listen to, but not much else";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;not sure how I feel about their next game though;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;I don't even remember anything about the story or any of the character names;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;It just looks like more of the same;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;Tokyo RPG could probably remake Chrono Trigger in that style;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;I didn't even finish it;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;Lost Sphear has a demo that I've been meaning to try;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;I don't even remember where I left off;;
Silverx1987#9781;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;Pilgrimage is all you need to remember.;;
Asura#5023;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;The demo is good;;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;"but yeah, looks like more of the same";;
Leon#9542;05-Jan-18 08:44 PM;I'll give it a shot tho;;
Silverx1987#9781;05-Jan-18 08:45 PM;Like Yuna's journey in Final Fantasy X.;;
Silverx1987#9781;05-Jan-18 08:46 PM;"Just that I Am Setsuna lacks depth and there isn't any emotional attachment that the player really feels towards the characters, atleast there weren't any for me. But the game still is pretty good and consider it much like an Indie title.";;
Seymour#0747;05-Jan-18 08:47 PM;what's I am Setsuna dev's next game called?;;
Silverx1987#9781;05-Jan-18 08:47 PM;Lost Sphere.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:52 PM;but;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:52 PM;It's just not a game that holds interest;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Jan-18 08:52 PM;it feels like you have to force yourself to play it;;
Zenkure#1365;06-Jan-18 04:29 AM;I was never hyped for that game. Game came and went and I didn’t even notice it;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Jan-18 05:23 PM;I'd consider that spamming.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Jan-18 05:29 PM;Could you please stop?;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:05 PM;@Kaizoku#9617 They NEVER would've gotten their memories back if Irvine didn't tell them.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:05 PM;"Yeah, but any character could have done that.";;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;No;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;That doesnt' tell me why he's a good character.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;"I mean, sure, I guess. If you change the story up.";;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;But the story as it is necessitates that it be Irvine that reminds  them.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;"Edea probably would've been taken out during the assassination attempt if they had a different sharpshooter, thus cutting almost everything in disc 2.";;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;Also getting rid of her redemption arc that spans into disc 3.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:06 PM;They literally could have labeled him asshat mcgee and had him grow up in Edea's house.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;And then remind the crew of their lost memories.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;And then left.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;And he would have accomplished just as much as Irvine.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;The only member of the main cast that wasn't really important was Zell tbh.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;Also;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;I'm pretty sure...Irvine never sniped Edea anyway;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;Failed to at the very least.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:07 PM;"He failed to, because he remembered her.";;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:08 PM;He couldn't kill the woman that was effectively his mother.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:08 PM;A different sharpshooter wouldn't have had that problem.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:08 PM;"As for Zell, his shining moment is in the D District Prison, just because he fought using his fists.";;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:08 PM;But Selphie or Quistis could have also done that.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:08 PM;There's no way they weren't trained in hand to hand combat.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:09 PM;Basically;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:09 PM;He's just some douche bag player archetype who aided them in remembering their past.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:09 PM;Which is actually kinda' bullshit.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:09 PM;Since the GF takes up that space in their brain.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:09 PM;So how could they remember it.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:09 PM;They literally say that they won't.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:10 PM;And that instead they'll start writing diaries and journals so that they remember.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:10 PM;"And I mean you're not inherently wrong but at the same time, Irvine spends most of his time in the game head over heels for Selphie.";;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:10 PM;So he's more of a subverted player archetyp.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:10 PM;Like Zidane is.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:10 PM;But really;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:11 PM;He just came across as more of a douchebag than Zidane.;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:11 PM;Or maybe that was because Zidane was MC;;
Kaizoku#9617;09-Jan-18 06:11 PM;not sure.;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 06:12 PM;It's because Zidane was the MC in a game where the entire cast was fleshed out beautifully apart from two of them.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Jan-18 06:24 PM;Irvine isn't a douche. Seifer is one though.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 07:01 PM;i liked Irvine;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 07:01 PM;and shot is a lovely alternative to Renzo spams;;
action warrior#8892;09-Jan-18 07:27 PM;Irvine was cool;;
action warrior#8892;09-Jan-18 07:33 PM;Seifer being a douhe was kinda the whole point of his character;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:33 PM;I mean he was a jerk even as a kid;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:34 PM;Kind of had to be punched to be better.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Jan-18 07:36 PM;*And his only two friends to leave him at the end* (They get better);;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Jan-18 07:36 PM;I feel sad for the guy really;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 07:37 PM;He got what was comin' to 'im.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:45 PM;all of those problems;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:45 PM;are solved with;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:46 PM;right?;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:46 PM;i mean even AP ammo is strangely self-satisfying;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 08:47 PM;My secondary team in Ultimecia castle was stupidly underleveled compared to the main team and even with the mob averages it sort of evened out;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 08:47 PM;as the mobs being stronger;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 08:47 PM;and then i would just wipe 'em out with pulse ammo;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:47 PM;almost everyone aside from the multiplae succesful playthrough crowd;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:47 PM;have a really bottom barrel 2nd team;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:48 PM;i mean i dont like to grind too much in that game;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:48 PM;because i dont like to hit the spell thresholds too early;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:49 PM;but irvine is in my party almost 100% of the time now;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:49 PM;i limit myself to what ammo i have;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:49 PM;usually because i get super bored and just card mod in disc 1 for like 6 hours;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 08:49 PM;If I ever replay again I may make my main team Squall/Irvine/Selphie;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;09-Jan-18 08:49 PM;and have a Lionheart before D2;;
Treble#5035;09-Jan-18 08:49 PM;Though it sorta feels weird not to have Rinoa there.;;

Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:17 PM;It actually feels like she was supposed to be part of the main cast.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:17 PM;But got cut.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:18 PM;I realized that when I was playing the game in December.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:18 PM;She has a slot in the party menu and everything. Seifer doesn't even get that.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;10-Jan-18 10:18 PM;thats where the distinction ends;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;10-Jan-18 10:18 PM;they can both equip gfs;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;10-Jan-18 10:18 PM;they both have limit breaks;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;10-Jan-18 10:19 PM;actually thats not true;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;10-Jan-18 10:20 PM;Why is Seifer such an asshole btw;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:20 PM;Also in the short time that you had her and she wasn't possessed she probably became the third most developed character in the game.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:20 PM;Behind Squall and Rinoa.;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;10-Jan-18 10:20 PM;that is true sir!;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:20 PM;(And after.);;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:20 PM;(Since we see her origin too);;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:21 PM;Seifer was an asshat because he was an asshat.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:21 PM;He's _always_ been an asshat.;;
Treble#5035;10-Jan-18 10:21 PM;It's not really dug into more than 'he used to always pick fights but Ellone stopped him';;

Chimpy#5375;16-Jan-18 04:44 PM;I think the specs are as high as they are due to Nividia wanting to push their latest line of cards. I really doubt this couldn't run on a 900 series card at 1080p easily enough. Yet alone needing a 1080ti for 4k.

Silverx1987#9781;16-Jan-18 05:07 PM;"Because what happened was, the fan died, I went to RMA it but was told something about the graphics card is no longer supported or something like that and that I could pay $100 with shipping for a newer model.

NerdintheNorth#2839;17-Jan-18 06:06 PM;What game?;;
Chimpy#5375;17-Jan-18 06:11 PM;Final Fantasy 1;;

Silverx1987#9781;17-Jan-18 06:36 PM;There's alot of hatred towards Final Fantasy II.;;
Deleted User#0000;17-Jan-18 06:36 PM;why?;;
Silverx1987#9781;17-Jan-18 06:37 PM;I believe it has to do with the way the leveling system works in that title.;;
Silverx1987#9781;17-Jan-18 06:37 PM;Or the way your character progresses rather.;;
Deleted User#0000;17-Jan-18 06:37 PM;how does it work?;;
Silverx1987#9781;17-Jan-18 06:39 PM;"I think it's something like, the more you use an abilitly or action, the stronger those become. So I guess it would be pretty 'grindy'.";;

Marcello#4574;17-Jan-18 06:42 PM;"Well, to be fair, emulating the PSP versions is good enough";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 04:15 PM;New theory in the works: IX shares the same world as XII/Tactics;;
action warrior#8892;18-Jan-18 04:19 PM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661 let me hear the evidence;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 04:20 PM;"Both deal with mist/mist is big part of the world/story, and the main source of travel is via airships. That's all I have at the moment. Again, this is still in the works, so I'm sure it can easily be debunked.";;
action warrior#8892;18-Jan-18 04:25 PM;12 would have to be set a few hundred years in the future;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 04:25 PM;Which is a possibility;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 04:25 PM;anything's possible with theories;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;18-Jan-18 04:58 PM;:D;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 04:59 PM;I guess that means it's time to go back to my ff8 and ff7 set in the same world theory;;

Chimpy#5375;18-Jan-18 05:04 PM;It probably was just an intentional reference 😛;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 05:31 PM;But if he wrote it why would he refer to the writing department when he references wall market;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 05:32 PM;And from someone who has written a rather large tome;;
NerdintheNorth#2839;18-Jan-18 05:32 PM;A game of that scope he didn't write it alone;;

BrunoBunno#1489;18-Jan-18 05:49 PM;But they are so far apart in time that it barely matters at all.;;
BrunoBunno#1489;18-Jan-18 05:49 PM;"Plus, back on the theme from before, opinions. Not everything is confirmed because of Kitase.";;
BrunoBunno#1489;18-Jan-18 05:50 PM;"I'm sorry, please take into consideration that I am a 15 year old with a short fuse and know a lot of people who love calling me stupid.";;
Marcello#4574;18-Jan-18 05:50 PM;TL:DR pls? why would X and VII be connected at all? Preferably without X spoilers;;

Aruu#2066;20-Jan-18 06:21 AM;Hi hi!;;
Miwagre The CombO QueeN#8804;20-Jan-18 06:43 AM;can someone explain ultimecias agenda im still confused;;
Aruu#2066;20-Jan-18 06:44 AM;@Dinoken2#0946 might be able to help;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 06:45 AM;Yes.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 06:53 AM;"So, Ultimecia is a sorceress from the future who medels in the past.  Her ultimate goal is to compress all of time into a single point, where she can then remake reality in her image.  The party lets her compress time so they can reach her in the future, but stop her before she can fully change reality., , Her motivation for why she wants to do this is a bit fuzzy and you have make a couple logical assumptions:, , 1.  The people of the present know that sometime in the future an evil sorceress named Ultimecia will take over the world, 2.  The people of the world are probably incredibly hostile to *any* sorceress after Rinoa., 3.  Ultimecia was a victim of this persecution, and is likely why she went bad., , There's a single point, early in the game where Ultimecia spells this out.  She's still pretending to be Edea though, so a lot of people forget about it.  It is her speech in Deling City., , ```...Lowlifes. ...Shameless filthy wretches. How you celebrate my ascension with such joy. Hailing the very one whom you have condemned for generations. Have you no shame? What happened to the evil, ruthless sorceress from your fantasies? The cold-blooded tyrant that slaughtered countless men and destroyed many nations? Where is she now? She stands before your very eyes to become your new ruler. HAHAHAHAHA! A new era has just begun. This is reality. No one can help you. Sit back and enjoy the show. Rest assured, you fools. Your time will come. This is only the beginning. Let us start a new reign of terror. I will let you live a fantasy beyond your imagination.```, , The irony in all of this, is that the terrible life that Ultimecia likely faced which turned her to evil was her own fault.  If she never went back to the past, the anti-sorceress sentiment likely would've never reached the point it did to create Ultimecia.  She's really a tragic character, but the game doesn't explore her too much.";;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 06:53 AM;@Miwagre The CombO QueeN#8804 hope that helps!;;
Aruu#2066;20-Jan-18 06:55 AM;"Goddamn, that's an excellent summary there Dino!";;
Miwagre The CombO QueeN#8804;20-Jan-18 06:55 AM;wow;;
Miwagre The CombO QueeN#8804;20-Jan-18 06:55 AM;i nvr thought of ultimecia that way;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 06:55 AM;I love FFVIII and think Ultimecia gets shit on way too much for being a lackluster villain.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 06:55 AM;Not the first time I've explained it lol.;;
Aruu#2066;20-Jan-18 06:57 AM;That's clever about the speech too.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 06:58 AM;"Yeah, it's one of those things you can pick up on when you replay knowing the twist.  VIII has a good story IMO, it just... doesn't tell it well.";;
Aruu#2066;20-Jan-18 07:00 AM;"I think that's the problem with a lot of FF games, especially on the first playthrough.";;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 07:01 AM;Yes.   It's a problem Square has had for a long time that no one likes to talk about.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 07:02 AM;"But Ultimecia specifically, people tend to think because she was revealed later in the game that she doesn't show up till later of the game.  But Ultimecia is there from the beginning, she's just pretending to be Edea.";;
Aruu#2066;20-Jan-18 07:02 AM;"Yeah that always confused me when I played, I kept getting them mixed up.";;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 07:04 AM;"Understandable.  The game tried to explain it, but it was a big exposition dump scene.  A scene where Squall isn't paying attention to the exposition because he's freaking out about Rinoa.";;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 07:04 AM;Bad story telling.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Jan-18 07:04 AM;"Anyway I'm out, have to drive to my aunts house.";;

Davkilla101#0932;20-Jan-18 09:49 PM;"Honestly, they were competing with the 3DS, which was already hugely popular";;

Thelitedragon#4507;20-Jan-18 09:50 PM;I think the issue stems from the expensive proprietary memory and sony practically dropping first party support in the first 3 years;;
Davkilla101#0932;20-Jan-18 09:50 PM;That too;;

Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:57 PM;"You just feel like disagreeing with me on anything now, Ultima \;)";;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:57 PM;Though you always said how you hated and doesn't give a fuck about emulation;;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:57 PM;So that's not surprising at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Jan-18 11:58 PM;You bring emulation into every conversation lol;;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:58 PM;So do me a favor then;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Jan-18 11:58 PM;"hey I like playing games on my handheld console, lol just play on PC via emulation";;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:58 PM;When people say they want to play FF VI;;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:58 PM;Tell them to buy the Steam version;;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:58 PM;Just so they don't emulate it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Jan-18 11:59 PM;I'd tell them not to play it at all before touching the Steam version;;
Marcello#4574;20-Jan-18 11:59 PM;"If you ever do it, and actually mean it, I'll never tell the word emulation ever again";;

Marcello#4574;21-Jan-18 12:00 AM;"But since you hate piracy and emulation so much, tell them to not play the game at all, unless they buy a SNES and an original cartridge";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jan-18 12:02 AM;It's moreso that I find it funny how you bring it into every conversation and try so hard prove why dedicated platforms that people would rather use are nothing compared to some community made emulator;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jan-18 12:02 AM;that's probably my issue;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;21-Jan-18 12:02 AM;🤔;;

Marcello#4574;21-Jan-18 12:03 AM;Because games can be a lot better using emulators instead of the original hardware?;;
Marcello#4574;21-Jan-18 12:04 AM;Also note that Virtual Console in Nintendo consoles aren't even as close as today's emulators;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;Ask Jecht;;
Mysterie#4433;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;would the child come out half dead;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;That'd make X-2 more interesting;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;"Also, Tidus and Jecht aren't Unsent, they're dreams";;
Mysterie#4433;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;These are the real questions nobody asks;;
Thelitedragon#4507;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;Ahh there you go;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;they're basically weak summons;;
Mysterie#4433;24-Jan-18 06:59 PM;Technically they are still unsent;;
Mysterie#4433;24-Jan-18 07:00 PM;since they lived in Zanarkand after it was destroied;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Jan-18 07:00 PM;Technically they're summons;;
Arie#6711;24-Jan-18 07:00 PM;No because they were never alive;;
Arie#6711;24-Jan-18 07:00 PM;"Dreams can reproduce, apparently";;
Arie#6711;24-Jan-18 07:00 PM;so that would explain how they exist;;

Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:04 PM;It has rooms that teleport you to the middle of it and you're basically forced to do an encounter before you can leave;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:04 PM;The thing is they put like;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:04 PM;four doors next to one another;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:04 PM;and three of them are these 'trap' rooms;;

NerdintheNorth#2839;25-Jan-18 07:35 PM;that being said though if someone were new to FF i wouldnt do the same dog and pony show;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:45 PM;hidden passages in FF games are fine as long as there's some in-game way of knowing they're there without trying to walk into every wall;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:45 PM;otherwise they're just poor game design;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:45 PM;I use walkthroughs so it doesn't really matter for me but for anyone who plays video games normally and not the way I do...;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:46 PM;FF V did it quite well;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:47 PM;It's possible to get all treasures and hidden paths without using walkthroughs;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:47 PM;yep;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:48 PM;the thief's see hidden passages ability;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:48 PM;that's *good* game design;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:48 PM;Well that was frustrating;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:48 PM;It makes me wanna put this game down already.;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:48 PM;Was put into a twenty minute session where I still lost due to having to rely on critical hits to damage the boss.;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:48 PM;Who then critical hit me through a few layers of blink level 5;;
action warrior#8892;25-Jan-18 07:49 PM;Hidden walls in ds2 lol;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:49 PM;FF IX has some of the worst game designs I've ever seen;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:49 PM;Most of the treasures are actually hidden;;
action warrior#8892;25-Jan-18 07:49 PM;Why;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:49 PM;You need to inspect every centimeter and find treasures;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:50 PM;shh if certain people hear you saying FFIX has flaws bad things will happen;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:50 PM;I don't care lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:50 PM;I'm kidding;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 07:50 PM;I shall protect you of course;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:50 PM;I hate the loot system and the soundtrack;;

Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:52 PM;"Oh, I forgot to mention the awful and highly missable ATEs";;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 07:53 PM;And the stupid Excalibur II challenge where you must reach the end of the game in under 12h;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:55 PM;Dunno what I should do differently;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:55 PM;"Maybe grind for more MP, but, that just sounds like a hassle.";;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:55 PM;Can't even run from most fights due to my low agility stat;;
Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 07:55 PM;Which would require more grinding;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:04 PM;"`but, that just sounds like a hassle`, , FFII gameplay in a nutshell tbh";;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:04 PM;"Most ff tbh, I went the wrong way in 6 oops";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:05 PM;"no FF game is as much of a hassle as FFII, except maybe FFIII";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Jan-18 08:11 PM;"As much as a chore it was to switch jobs and level them for certain situations, I think II is much more tedious";;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:21 PM;I'm not saying they are more of a hassle just that the games in general are like that;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:22 PM;maybe;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:22 PM;Every FF games have at least one mechanic you really hate;;

Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:23 PM;Materia :^);;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:24 PM;I can't say one from IV right away though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:24 PM;"well, IV had secret passages that you basically need a walkthrough to find";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:24 PM;so that;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:24 PM;hmm;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:24 PM;also Edward;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;I can't remember them very much;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;just Edward in general;;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;I enjoyed looking though;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;Nah;;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;I'd agree with Edward;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;mechanically;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;I like him as a character;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;Spoony Bard was just fine;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:25 PM;He leaves after a short period anyway;;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:26 PM;"Found my way in 6 I'm outs, forest here I comeeeeee";;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:26 PM;"I didn't like Tellah though, because he had a very low MP cap";;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:26 PM;So basically he becomes useless very quickly;;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:26 PM;Rydia best fuck tellah;;
moshi..mo#4014;25-Jan-18 08:26 PM;Ok now I'm out;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:26 PM;...that sentence doesn't sound very good lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:27 PM;5: Some of the later jobs feel far too niche and specific to actually be useful;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:27 PM;"eh, but that doesn't bother me that much";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:27 PM;and also Gilgamesh should appear in every scene but he doesn't;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:27 PM;^;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:27 PM;Now we're talking;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:28 PM;"I dare say I, IV and V are the least annoying I've played so far";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:28 PM;on a more serious note;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:28 PM;I think it would have been more narratively ... well-constructed? to introduce either Exdeath or Gilgamesh a tad earlier;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:29 PM;Maybe;;
Marcello#4574;25-Jan-18 08:29 PM;Just Exdeath;;
action warrior#8892;25-Jan-18 08:29 PM;4 is hard;;

Chimpy#5375;25-Jan-18 08:37 PM;II is infinitely more troublesome than III;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;25-Jan-18 08:41 PM;it makes up for it by having a better story and a villain with an actual personality >_>;;

Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:10 PM;time for my comeback with style and grace;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:10 PM;That entire segment of the game is just cringe because of Morgana;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:10 PM;(and copy pasted from Teddie);;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:10 PM;though Mona and Ryuji are just really badly written in that section;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:11 PM;Ryuji and mona are probably the best characters in the damn game as far as party members go;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:11 PM;>best;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:11 PM;*worst;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:11 PM;I will remind you guys taht I'm still playing through P4 for the first time;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:11 PM;Nah;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:11 PM;Makoto is worst;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;>makoto;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;Yusuke sucks too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;your opinion is wrong;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;I was so about to spoil the last boss of p4 lol then I remembered;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;"I like morgana, ryuji, ann";;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;you'll never guess who it is btw;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;Only party members i will consider using as of right now;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;"```, I will remind you guys taht I'm still playing through P4 for the first time, ```, well this is the spoiler channel so.....";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;should be a bit expected lol;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;Kinda can't put screenshots anywhere else;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:12 PM;Though I think the point is final fantasy spoilers;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:13 PM;I just finished palace four in p5 so i have a way to go;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:13 PM;"Oh, Futaba's palace was 👌";;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:13 PM;Yeah i loved it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:13 PM;Futaba's palace was the best written section of the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:13 PM;hands down;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;you can see the creative peak at that point of the game;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;I liked the design too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;unfortunately the one that comes next......;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;"Mhmm, not too sure about Virtue, tbh";https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/406663207344668672/20180127131400_1.jpg;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;is a huge dud;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;And the fact there are puzzles;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;The earlier palaces had no puzzles;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;"Yeah, 5th palace was my second least favorite";;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;What was your least favourite;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;7th palace;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:14 PM;"A: because Morgana is annoying, B: Because it takes so fucking long";;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;Because hallway puzzles;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;The bank was disappointing compared to the first two;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;x a billion;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;oh yeah 7th was kinda bad too;;
action warrior#8892;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;So the last palace is the worst;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;took way longer than it should;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;Yeah da *boat*;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:15 PM;"Here's this hallway puzzle you did in the last area, but longer this time.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;then they give you 3 boss fights back to back before the calling card;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;Did you like it? Because you're getting more of them.;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;Uh no;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;It was like 6 boss fights;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;3;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;"The 5 VIPs, and that one guy I can't say because Mona's in chat";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:16 PM;I'm speaking only of the last section of that dungeon where you can't leave;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;after the first boss;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;because after leaving starts the next one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;which then starts a third one;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;Wait;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;Do you mean the series of battles starting with the 5th VIP?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;yes;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:17 PM;Then the two shadows?;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;Then Gesundheit?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;the very last 3 fights before the calling card were all in one part;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;"Ah, ok";;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;I know what you mean now;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;there was space between the first and the next two;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;"Yeah, that was honestly brutal";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;but if you had no SP items;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;"Yes the y boss, a1 and a2";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;you were fucked;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:18 PM;because you can't leave;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:19 PM;"But it was more like 4 boss fights, since *that guy* had like two phases";;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:19 PM;After you went into the small crawlspace and fought that guy;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:19 PM;I suppose;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:19 PM;But the game gave you clear warning and there was a safe room like down the hall lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:19 PM;still bs;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:19 PM;The point being that you can't get back there;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;and what most people think is that just like the last 6 dungeons;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;you're safe to just walk back without danger;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;I mean it's the usual SMT bullshit;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;but still;;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;You can't expect people to know right?;;
Davkilla101#0932;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;"Surprise boss fight, motherfucker!";;
Thelitedragon#4507;26-Jan-18 10:20 PM;That's why it juked a lot of peole;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:21 PM;there is no way to know;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;26-Jan-18 10:21 PM;no signs to atleast stress the idea of preparation;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:32 AM;But at least his sister still cares for him.;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:32 AM;What's the deal with Berseria's ending though?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:32 AM;Zaveid indirectly protects him for a long amount of time;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:32 AM;Just the connection;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:33 AM;Zesty is the same world except 1000 years later;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:33 AM;But I mean;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:33 AM;Laphicet is referred to as someone else (forgot what they call him) but basically he's been demonized as well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:33 AM;which is really bad for the world because he was the one that kept shit in order;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;Hmm;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;game never states how it happened either;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;But what's the problem with Berseria's ending?;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;So I guess it isn't that major;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;Berseria's ending is fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:34 AM;what do you mean?;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;Don said it was ruined by Zestiria;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;But anyway;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;Eh;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;Not that big of a deal;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;It's because when you played Zestiria;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;you know that the happy ending doesn't last;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:35 AM;and takes a complete turn for the worst;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:36 AM;That's how Zesty ruins it;;

Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:37 AM;I'll just stay on Berseria;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:37 AM;And Velvet's quest for vengeance managed to set in motion something that'd become a circular series of events;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:37 AM;Maybe Symphonia one day;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:37 AM;oh yeah that;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:37 AM;Velvet is partly the reason why Zestiria's problems exist;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:37 AM;in a way;;

Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:38 AM;Very emotional;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:38 AM;anyway Symphonia is decent;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;no;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;With bonus stuff;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;but the PS3 version is better;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;much;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;better;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;Yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;but only in japanese;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:39 AM;The differences between the two is kinda disrespectful imo;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;Wtf;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;Welp;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;they added 2 characters and integrated them into the story;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;assloads of side content;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;I wonder if there's a fan translation out there.. Now that PS3 emulators are better;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;I could play it on my 360;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;There is;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:40 AM;Perhaps;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:41 AM;"Vesperia, even in its reduced state that we got in the West, was a great game";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:41 AM;glad I imported it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:41 AM;still have the game too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:41 AM;even though I don't have my PS3 anymore;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:42 AM;There's still hope;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:43 AM;probably;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:43 AM;in the distant future;;
Marcello#4574;27-Jan-18 01:43 AM;It will probably have another port;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:43 AM;but honestly I doubt it will happen;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:43 AM;if they gave Abyss precedence over it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Jan-18 01:43 AM;there's hardly any hope;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jan-18 01:44 AM;"I dunno.. As I understood it, Abyss was very popular";;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:45 AM;Bishop because they use magic lol;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:46 AM;Nu mou Time Mages make no difference to the moogle Time Mages;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:46 AM;Except they have more MP;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:47 AM;"Sages are VERY useful, with their magic";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:47 AM;"Alchemists are, hands down, a better solution to picking one job";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:48 AM;Why? Cause they can use items regardless of your second a-action;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:48 AM;"I chose the Alchemist+Sagacity part, cause the rest are just meh";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:48 AM;"Morpher is a good job too, but the sad part, is that you can't use them to make your Blue Mage learn the attacks of that enemy";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:49 AM;"And Morphers also require a Hunter, so you can Capture monsters";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-Jan-18 10:49 AM;"So the good jobs are just, Alchemist, Sage, and Beastmasters";;

I think I've had a more enjoyable time with some Action 52 games than I've had playing this so far.";;

Chimpy#5375;28-Jan-18 09:14 PM;Nothing mechanically in this game makes any fucking sense;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:14 AM;Got the Meryl ending because I rustled up a mashing technique that worked for me.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:15 AM;I'm watching moose and trees now.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:16 AM;I dunno how I'd rate it in the franchise.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:17 AM;"I feel like it was less refined than all the later games, and the story didn't grip me as hard emotionally.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:17 AM;"However, it had some of the best action sequences, and it's super impressive for a PSX game.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:18 AM;"Level design also felt super tight, without it feeling like it was on rails.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 11:18 AM;Which is how I felt for MGS 2 sometimes.;;
Driver#6666;29-Jan-18 02:26 PM;@Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140 You are pretty good;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:30 PM;Speaking of being good.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:31 PM;I felt like there were a lot of difficulty spikes sprinkled in.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:31 PM;That just sorta petered out quickly.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:32 PM;Like MG Rex was super climactic and then the Liquid boxing was actually pretty challenging.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:33 PM;And then you just weave a gun back and forth for a few minutes and *that's* the end of the game?;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:33 PM;"MGS 3 did it the other way, chase -> final boss.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:34 PM;Then a nice conclusion to the Ocelot subplot.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:37 PM;"MGS2 suffered from a similar thing, you've just been given the HF blade (with one short area to learn it) and Solidus has to be easy or it would be unfair.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:38 PM;Kind of a mood killer.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:38 PM;MGS 3+4 do it right IMO.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:39 PM;And MGR does late-game very well.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:39 PM;Armstrong is one of the most badass fights in video gaming.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:42 PM;And he comes *after* an awesome fight with a Metal Gear.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:45 PM;"One thing, I think the Meryl ending is shoehorned pretty hard.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:46 PM;Seems very much like ticking a box on a how to do Bond list.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:46 PM;"And given it's the true ending, it kinda sucks.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:47 PM;"Kojima apparently thought the same, it's backpedaled on hard in MGS 4.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:51 PM;"I've heard that the Big Boss fights in MG 1+2 are somewhat anticlimactic as well, so maybe it's just a series trope at this point.";;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:56 PM;"It's just a little unfortunate that Metal Gear has a few super well designed endings (from a gameplay standpoint, ending​ the gameplay before it trails off and such), but also some that very obviously could have been done better.";;
BlueHighwind#5448;29-Jan-18 02:56 PM;the only good final boss in a Metal Gear game is The Boss in MGS3;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:56 PM;You didn't like Ocelot boxing?;;

Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:57 PM;Surely you don't hate Armstrong?;;
BlueHighwind#5448;29-Jan-18 02:57 PM;"oh yeah, duh";;
BlueHighwind#5448;29-Jan-18 02:57 PM;Armstrong is like the best boss of the PS3 era;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:58 PM;MGR is one of the few games where I actively enjoy challenge.;;
Jolly Fruitpunchsamurai37#6140;29-Jan-18 02:59 PM;Because it's so dynamic that pulling of hard stuff well is super rewarding.;;
BlueHighwind#5448;29-Jan-18 03:05 PM;"you should play better games, challenge is one of the best parts of vidya garms";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Feb-18 12:48 AM;Okay so automod deleted my thread because lol automatic word filtering so I'm just going to post here;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Feb-18 12:49 AM;"Hi, yes I just finished Final Fantasy 8 and I have a few questions, first of all WHAT THE FUCK?!?!, , Okay, yeah, so we kill Ultimecia, she explodes which presumably leads into time decompressing. Sure, okay, I buy that, makes sense to me, great. But then we get what amounts to a Japanese version of the last ten minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey, which, okay, artistic license is great and all but you still need to explain some shit to me., * Why are we in this grey nowhere-space?, * Why is Rinoa in the dark flower field?, * Didn't they just have to think real hard about Edea's house and they'd end up there?, * Why is Squall DEAD and then suddenly okay at the end of the party scene?, * How did everyone get to Balamb in the first place?, * Why do we get to see the scene of Riona noticing Squall for the first time except in increasingly weird blur-o-vision, except for the one time she's in the Champs-d'Élysées in Deling?, Okay that last one I have a theory about, I was running under the assumption that since time was unwinding itself, the universe was replaying every conceivable variation of that moment in time that could ever possibly happen until the right one lined up with our current reality., Yeah I'm...confused. Also we never get to see Squall and Rinoa kiss on the balcony which makes sense for running manga series but not for a one-off game. C'mon Square, don't give me romance blue balls here.";;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Feb-18 01:13 AM;"So it's 2am and I'm pretty tired and about to go to bed, but I'll do my best here.  I approved your post on the sub, sorry automod got it.  , , Squall gets lost in time because he's unable to concentrate on Edea's house and his friends.  He wanders until he can't anymore and then he receives the visions/hallucinations/views of alternate timelines/whatever.  Not entirely sure what it is, and the game is over so there's no exposition scene to explain.  , , Everyone but Squall was able to return to Edea's house.  The rest of the party got back fine and were likely able to easily get back to Balamb Garden when they returned to the proper time., , How Rinoa ended up in the Void with Squall is unknown.  Likely it has something to do with her Sorceress powers, maybe Ellone helped.  It's not clear at all.  Squall is either A) just knocked out in that scene, or B) actually dead and again Rinoa's powers bring him back to life.";;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Feb-18 01:15 AM;Also Rinoa is running through the flower field before she ends up in the Void because she's looking for Squall.  Squall had promised her if they ever got seperated they would meet at the flower field.;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Feb-18 01:15 AM;"I hope that helps.  I'm off to bed myself, but any more questions feel free to leave them and I'll answer them when I wake up.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Feb-18 01:16 AM;Thanks. I appreciate it.;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Feb-18 01:18 AM;If I was more awake I'd be able to give a better description of the ending but most of it comes down to I dunno Rinoa is a sorceress?  Time compression?;;
Dinoken2#0946;01-Feb-18 01:18 AM;Never really cared for VIII's ending for that reason.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Feb-18 01:23 AM;Yeah I was kinda let down.;;

ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:54 AM;What dragoon time ? With emperor ?;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:54 AM;Or before ?;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:54 AM;Getting Ricard.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:54 AM;Oh ! Ok;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:54 AM;I really love Ricaro;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:55 AM;"Oh, it's Ricard in the English version ?";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:55 AM;I like him too. He's my most fond companion in FF2;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:55 AM;Yes.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:55 AM;His death was the only one that impacted me;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:56 AM;"Clearly my best too. Minnwu's death make me feel something too, even if he's not as développed as Ricard";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:57 AM;(It's so weird. Ricard is the name of an alchool drink here so... I guess that's why they change the name ahah);;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:58 AM;"Oh, where are you located? Minwu's death is a heroic one in its own sense too, but, Ricard's sacrifice is set on a  much grander stage.";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 09:59 AM;I'm in France. And i totally agree. It's like Joseph's death. Very heroic but not as powerful as ricard's one;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:00 AM;"(And in a totally other way, Leila is very strong and totally love her)";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:01 AM;"Ricard's death feels as if matters magnitudes more due to him being the last of his kind. While Kain, his son in Dist, is there to eventually become a dragoon Ricard is the last true dragoon from that period.";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:02 AM;Yes ! I was so sad for Kain and even the women.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:03 AM;II is really hard on that point. Lots of characters dies and it's a very sad and tragic ending to me;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:03 AM;"I believe the woman is his mother and Ricard's wife too, so it would be heartbreaking.";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:04 AM;"Yeah, but, a lot of the deaths held little impact to me due the length of time we spend with the characters as well.";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:04 AM;"In French trad, I think it's totally said it's his wife";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:04 AM;"Yes it is sad Josef dies because his daughter is now an orphan, but, I wasn't given enough time to bond with him.";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:05 AM;Minwu vanishes from the story for 20 something hours before being sent off to die.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:05 AM;That why I really enjoy the rebirth part;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:05 AM;"Yes, it's one of the best additions to the game.";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:06 AM;And plying Scott is kind of cool for me;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;"Yeah, but, Scott's death was probably one of the most disappointing.";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;We know nothing about him before he kicks the bucket.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;Cleanly;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;Clearly*;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;Clean;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;"It's expanded on in Rebirth, but, that's added much later";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:09 AM;But it may be one that set in motion things;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:10 AM;"Because without that, Gordon would be the character we know";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:11 AM;We needed to escape Phin as a gameplay thing.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:11 AM;So we could of interacted with Scott.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:11 AM;"If they do a real remake of II, I'm sure it would be a thing";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:11 AM;And that will be such an epic start for a game !;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:13 AM;I dunno how someone would even handle  a true remake of FF2.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:13 AM;They've changed it so much from the original game.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:13 AM;Mechanically I mean.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:14 AM;"Yeah... but in my idealistic mind, every old FF need a real remake (and for me, espacially V)";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:15 AM;III has one that I like. IV had one too (I enjoy it as well so.. that's ok);;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:16 AM;I am incredibly disappointed that FFV and FFVI did not receive remakes on the same tier as FFIV on PSP;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:16 AM;"I and II had lots of new things added, but in my opinion, they also need a real thing to them";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:17 AM;I'm so upset because they did a GBA remake of V... when the DS was out and one year before III DS.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:17 AM;And it's... i just don't get it;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:20 AM;"A lot easier to port to the GBA. Probably biggest issue was sound fidelity, which we saw what happened there.";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:22 AM;"In my opinion, they never try really hard to open V to western audience, and that quite sad";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:22 AM;Because V have so much to him.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:23 AM;I know they had a PC version in the works that was canceled.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:24 AM;Ted Woosley was going to translate it too;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:25 AM;"Hum... i may be a fool, but I'm still holding that hope that they will do V and VI remake one day.";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:25 AM;I imaging  they will eventually. Definitely VI sometime.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:26 AM;But it probably will end up like the FF7 remake;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:26 AM;"Yeah, VI is really a possibility, and I really don't care about the way they will do it";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:26 AM;As long as they do it and respect the original game;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:27 AM;"(By respect, I mean don't alter the story too much and respect characters)";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:27 AM;I know some will say the changing of mechanics is disrespect but that's another topic altogether;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:29 AM;"In my opinion, they can't do the same game. Change mechanics can be really a plus";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:29 AM;As long as it fit in the new game;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:29 AM;Well that's the difference between a remaster and remake.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:30 AM;Yep;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:30 AM;We will have to wait and see.;;

Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:49 AM;"If you want to have fun with it, play the gBA or higher version";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:49 AM;"No Zephyr, I am playing the NeS version";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:49 AM;Sorry for that confusion.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:49 AM;Well... I don't know. I'l so bad in English I don't know if I tell my things right or not ><;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 10:49 AM;"@Chimpy#5375 aah, gotcha";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:50 AM;"You are fine Zephyr, just didn't want to confuse you. I realize how I typed that out could be misconstrued.";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:50 AM;That's ok ^^ don't worry;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:51 AM;Farewell Aerith !;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:51 AM;I will probably go more in depth about my feelings after I finish it.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:51 AM;You... will not miss me so much !;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:51 AM;I need to do it for FF1 as well but I haven't had the time.;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 10:53 AM;"i've been playing III (DS) right after finishing V (GBA), trying to go as blind as i'm able to";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 10:53 AM;and choosing a job/class feels like a lot of commitment haha;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:53 AM;"I am going semi-blind into these, since it's been a long time.";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:54 AM;You shouldn't worry so much about it Soft.;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:54 AM;You can change willynilly;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 10:54 AM;"aah, haha thanks";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:55 AM;"Anyway, time for lunch";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 10:55 AM;I'll be back;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:55 AM;See you latter !;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 10:55 AM;later;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:56 AM;"Soft, choose job you want to play. It's the best way";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 10:56 AM;Even if some fight may become more difficult ahah;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:04 AM;aah;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:05 AM;Oh ! Disk one stop here ! Ok !;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:05 AM;"well, right now i have a white mage, black mage, geomancer, and viking";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:05 AM;Geomancer... i LOVÉ this job;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:05 AM;"they're...kinda the jobs i want to play with, but i think i'll definitely do another run of the game after i beat it because there's so many interesting jobs";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:06 AM;@ZephyrBoree#6389 yeah!;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:06 AM;It's quite a magic team;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:06 AM;geomancer does so much damage in this game;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:06 AM;"I must say... yeah, I find it a little bit overpowered";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:06 AM;But I like it anyways;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:07 AM;And don't be afraid to try jobs. I know it's kind of strange to not have a real healer on a team;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:07 AM;But it can had some interesting mechanics;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:07 AM;ooh;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:07 AM;"But as I said, the more important is to have a team you enjoy playing with";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:07 AM;i'll try to do another run without a dedicated healer next time definitely!;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:08 AM;cool 😃;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:08 AM;A thing I did in my last run was to only use job from the last crystal I get;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:09 AM;that's a neat idea;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:09 AM;It can be hard on some moment but you really have to think of what's your doing with your job repartition;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:10 AM;yeah;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:10 AM;"And it make me use job I never enjoy but as I was obliged to use them, I kind to learn to like thel";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:10 AM;Like viking !;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:10 AM;haha;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:11 AM;i just did the hover shoes dungeon/quest when you reactivate the flow of time in the surface world;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:12 AM;"and my viking was getting only 1 dmg hits, whereas the same attacks would deal 160+ to my other back row mages";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:12 AM;Ok ! I see exactly where you are !;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:13 AM;so i'm in love with the viking already;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:13 AM;"Yeah, during my last run, I learn that a Viking is so useful to protect this fragile Geomancer";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:13 AM;And i was a little sad when I had to change it;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:14 AM;"You just get Invoker, dragoon, black knight, bard, and two other jobs no ?";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:14 AM;(With the water crystal);;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:15 AM;yup!;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:16 AM;"I have to say... I really enjoy Bard, but it's not an easy job ahah";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:19 AM;it does seem a very interesting job. it was also a very neat tricky job on FFV;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:23 AM;I love bards. I don't know why but I always love to play them;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:30 AM;i think bards and dancers were pretty fun class to play in V;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 11:31 AM;but the class/job i found the most useful during the end game was time mage almost exclusively thanks to the Quick spell :p;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 11:37 AM;"Time mage is one of my favorite, in fact, I think I really enjoy support job/characters";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 12:24 PM;Freelancer/Mime 😛;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;01-Feb-18 12:25 PM;Mime is confusing;;
Malfred#1000;01-Feb-18 12:28 PM;Depends on the game;;
Malfred#1000;01-Feb-18 12:28 PM;"For the most part, they're pretty OP if you have more than one";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;01-Feb-18 12:29 PM;In fft tho;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;01-Feb-18 12:29 PM;They're pretty hard to use;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 12:56 PM;"I find mime always a hard job, but once you understand who it work in game, one of the best";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;01-Feb-18 12:56 PM;"(Best in term of possibility, but not personal best)";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:27 PM;"@Chimpy#5375 yeah, i've read freelancer is the way to go on V";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:27 PM;"i think i did use a freelancer with Dance and Time, equipo the things to make Sword Dance more likely and do a Quick before going for it. 9999x2";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 01:30 PM;Mimes are fun in FFT;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:32 PM;i love FFTA and A2 but i've actually never played Tactics! 😮;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:32 PM;is it on steam?;;
themockingguy#6969;01-Feb-18 01:33 PM;"Sadly, no";;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:33 PM;"apparently n--yeah, haha";;
themockingguy#6969;01-Feb-18 01:33 PM;"It's on mobile, but the controls suck";;
themockingguy#6969;01-Feb-18 01:34 PM;"The original is from PS1, but the better version is the port of the PSP";;
themockingguy#6969;01-Feb-18 01:34 PM;And that got ported to mobile;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:35 PM;i see. it's good to know!;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 01:35 PM;It's on PSN;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:35 PM;"FF3's PSP version is also very good, anyone knows if the steam version is the same?";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 01:35 PM;Both versions are .;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 01:36 PM;Steam is near the same as PSP;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:36 PM;neat;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:37 PM;i don't have a ps4. used to have a fat ps3 but it died;;
softdelete#2924;01-Feb-18 01:38 PM;hopefully SE ports FFT on steam too 😃;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Feb-18 04:42 PM;https://youtu.be/D842cwVZkbE I miss this version of Otherworld;;
La Justice#5521;01-Feb-18 06:55 PM;What's that;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Feb-18 06:57 PM;"In the PS2 version of X, when you go to fight BFA, that version of the song plays instead of the normal one";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Feb-18 06:57 PM;"For whatever reason, Square decided to replace it with the normal one in the HD version";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Feb-18 06:57 PM;and maybe the international version;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Feb-18 06:57 PM;"I can't say for sure, cause I haven't played the international version";;

Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:04 PM;It's nice;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:04 PM;I joined his discord;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:04 PM;It's okay;;
Silverx1987#9781;01-Feb-18 09:04 PM;"Yeah, I like their reviews. It's always well thoughtout.";;
Chimpy#5375;01-Feb-18 09:07 PM;"Mhm, not very active in his community though";;
Lime#6560;01-Feb-18 10:40 PM;"I can't remember if it was this way in the original but I feel like Kefka's personality is kinda ruined in Dissidia. He feels too silly and zany, and a lot of his blood thirsty, psychotic traits feel forced.";;
Lime#6560;01-Feb-18 10:43 PM;I'm not sure if it's just me or if he acted this way in the original Japanese version seeing as I played the SNES version of FFVI and maybe this juvenile personality is much more aligned to the original Japanese script.;;
ZephyrBoree#6389;02-Feb-18 12:41 AM;"I don't know how silly he is in Dissidia, but in the French version of VI, Kefka is not really depict as a blood thirsty character. He seem really childish and silly. And his psychotic mind just grow more and more during the game...";;
ZephyrBoree#6389;02-Feb-18 12:42 AM;Maybe it's more based on the original JP character yes;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 09:52 AM;he definitely has his goofy moments in FF6;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 09:53 AM;"but i've not played Dissidia, haha, so i can't really compare";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:24 AM;"he's especially pretty goofy pre-Floating Continent since Square was trying to hide the fact that he was the biggest bad until then, , which is now no longer relevant since even most people who haven't played FFVI know he's the main villain, but back in the day...";;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:25 AM;good point!;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:26 AM;in fact;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:26 AM;to Japanese players;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:27 AM;"who were playing FFVI, in an age without pervasive internet";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:27 AM;he likely would have been thought of as the game's version of Gilgamesh;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:27 AM;until the reveal;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:27 AM;"after all, he fits Gilgamesh's basic outline, as far as it seems in the early game:, goofy, subordinate to some evil king, keeps appearing";;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:29 AM;that would've been very cool to experience;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:30 AM;I'm really hoping the Final Every Fantasy guy doesn't know that Kefka is FFVI's villain so he can experience that feeling;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:31 AM;of course he's still working on getting the Floater in FFI so that's a long way away;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:40 AM;haha;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:43 AM;"he's not the best, though he's getting better, he still runs away too often, and still doesn't play quite often enough to always remember what he's supposed to do, but he has definitely improved in the year he has been playing";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;now the fun thing is;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;aah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;I'm pretty sure he basically went into the series knowing almost nothing about it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;so that's the fun part;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;but he's very;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;...slow;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;hahah;;
Deleted User#0000;02-Feb-18 10:47 AM;*casts slow*;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:48 AM;I advise him in the comments sometimes;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:48 AM;but I haven't actually watched his vids in a while;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:48 AM;maybe he's never played a Square RPG? i hadn't ever play a FF but still had some idea of what to expect thanks to chrono and mario rpg;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:48 AM;"I don't think he has, no";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;when he finishes FFI I'll probably tell him about how FFII works in advance so that he's not super confused;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;hahaha;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;he actually didn't know about the II/IV discrepancy;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;until I told him;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;oh;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;he's actually playing FFI on a physical NES;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;so it was important he was aware of that;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:49 AM;he'll probably have to emulate for II and III;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:50 AM;as blind as a run can get;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:50 AM;indeed;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:50 AM;he's trying to experience the series it would have been experienced back in the day;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:50 AM;problem is;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:50 AM;he never specified whether he meant for a Japanese player or for a Western player;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:50 AM;but I'll be doing what I can to help lol;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:51 AM;"might even suggest a romhack for IV that makes it the actual Japanese version of the game but in English, instead of the version that was released on the SNES in the West that was unnecessarily easy and different";;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:52 AM;is the IV GBA version ported from the West or JP?;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:52 AM;I'm pretty sure all versions of IV except SNES are based on the JP version;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:52 AM;but for GBA I'm certain of it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:52 AM;obviously the 3D versions are the exception;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:52 AM;aah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:53 AM;so yeah the GBA port is fine;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:53 AM;PSP port is basically the same as the GBA version but better looking and with better sound quality;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:54 AM;"well it also has the 3D version's arrangement, but it has the GBA's bonus content, unlike the 3D version";;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:54 AM;TIL;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:55 AM;"but man, as far as Final Every Fantasy goes, I'm not even sure he's aware there's anything in the series but fantasy elements, I can't wait to see how he reacts to there being an airship";;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:56 AM;from the sound of it watching him play is a test of patience;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:56 AM;he should stream it instead;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:56 AM;nah;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;then he wouldn't really be able to play at his own pace;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;I don't want to rush him;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;sure he'd be able to get advice from Stream chat;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;"but he wants to do this on his own, he plays like for 30 minutes every week because he's pretty busy irl";;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;i see;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;not ideal but hey it extends the experience;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;30 minutes;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;I guess;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;and he's enjoying it;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;so there's that;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:57 AM;i'm playing FF3 and spent like 20 minutes choosing between jobs;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:58 AM;"yeah haha, important thing is he's enjoying it";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 10:58 AM;when I played FFIII I sometimes spent 15 minutes wondering why I was playing FFIII;;
softdelete#2924;02-Feb-18 10:58 AM;hahahah;;

mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 11:03 AM;well tbh the Onion Knight isn't that great;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;02-Feb-18 11:03 AM;though it's nice against the superboss;;

Aruu#2066;02-Feb-18 01:52 PM;"They're talking about Tidus. Hornless refers to Kimahri, because they broke his horn during a previous fight, and Tidus, who obviously doesn't have a horn.";;

Chimpy#5375;05-Feb-18 08:46 PM;Which would be handy to have known hours ago where I could resonably grind it up while I was playing. Now I have to sit aside and grind. The most fun of any game that's ever existed. If I'm going to go through the effort of that I might as well just get Wall as well and beat the game that way so I never run into another roadblock.;;

Thelitedragon#4507;05-Feb-18 08:48 PM;The main problem is the fundemental way the game approaches leveling;;
Thelitedragon#4507;05-Feb-18 08:49 PM;It stresses grinding almost too much;;

beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:49 PM;kk;;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:50 PM;He is a confused Teenage boy who feels like the noble name has betrayed him.;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:50 PM;"from what I understand, part of his ruthless ways were";;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:50 PM;He doesn't agree with the rebellion and he doesn't agree with the kingdom.;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:50 PM;"Him framing someone for a crime that may not have even happened and summarily excecuting them, just to get ahead in the northern order";;

MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:51 PM;"I have interpreted him as caring for Ramza as a person, and hating who he works for.";;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:51 PM;"And him supposedly killing Yalmafra, or whatever her name is";;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:51 PM;Think of him more like an Anti Hero than a villain;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:51 PM;Definitely that;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:52 PM;I guess I do kinda have an idea on how he's a bad guy;;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:52 PM;"He's not a villain, hes like Anakin from the prequels";;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:52 PM;But how does he end up being king?;;

MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:52 PM;Yeah;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:53 PM;and ramza took care of the other major issue that woulda stood in his way;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:53 PM;so...;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:53 PM;"Basically, this coulda been a happy story";;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:53 PM;If Delita had condemned the church after becoming king;;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:53 PM;I don't view him as a bad guy. I view him as a confused boy after going through a lot of BS.;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:54 PM;I understand the BS. Algus is up there with Dolores Umbridge as most hated villians to me;;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:54 PM;Like they killed his sister because she was in the way.;;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:55 PM;You watched the Prequel StarWars?;;
beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:55 PM;yeah;;
MajorBroski#8359;08-Feb-18 03:55 PM;The Jedi order didn't care but to use Anakin;;

beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:57 PM;and did whatever nescesarry to change things;;

beebajazz#9174;08-Feb-18 03:57 PM;But he didn't really work with Ramza;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:47 PM;"Cloud in AC is dealing with all of the grief and trauma from VII.  The course of the story in VII takes place over *a single week*.  During that time Cloud meets a girl, starts to fall in love, and has her die in his arms.  He finds out that everything he thought he knew about himself is wrong.  He witnesses all this horror and loss at the hands of ShinRa and Sephiroth, but there's just no time to deal with it.  Meteor is coming, ShinRa is after them, they need to stop Sephiroth, etc.  AC is Cloud finally dealing with all the crap that he's gone through since Crisis Core.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:47 PM;This is no defense of the white washing of Aerith's character though;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:48 PM;Square has fucked with VII's story a lot through retcons and sequels.  Sephiroth has had so many different motivations and endgames at this point it can be hard to keep up.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:48 PM;But Cloud in AC actually makes sense.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:49 PM;"Is it a likable version of the character?  No, not at all.  Mopey depressed Cloud is the worst Cloud, but he's like that way for a reason.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:51 PM;"Also the PSP Dissidia games are really poor representations of *all* the characters.  The story was written to be simple, and to balance the large cast they dumbed down each character to their defining trait.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:51 PM;NT portrays the characters *much better* but there's nowhere near as much story content so it doesn't really matter.;;
Asura#5023;13-Feb-18 04:52 PM;I never interpret that Cloud was falling in love with Aerith.;;
Asura#5023;13-Feb-18 04:52 PM;I thought it was just a love triangle;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:52 PM;NT's supposed to get more story content via dlc and stuff so there's that to look forward to;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:53 PM;VII is like a love square;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:53 PM;Tidus isn't even real. And it's debatable whether he really existed at some  point;;
Shiro Kagura#3771;13-Feb-18 04:53 PM;HAHAHA;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:53 PM;To me he's just a bunch of pyreflies acting goofy.;;

Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:55 PM;"He has a consciousness, he feels and thinks";;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:55 PM;all of that is real;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:55 PM;There's no evidence that he thinks or feels;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:56 PM;That's not how that works.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:56 PM;Tidus is biologically human;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:56 PM;he isn't a robot piloted by the pyreflies themselves;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:56 PM;Just because his head got blown off in the prologue novel doesn't mean he's real;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:56 PM;they're just a conduit for his existence;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:56 PM;One of the creators or the Ultimania confirmed it.;;

Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:57 PM;Tidus obviously feels and thinks;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:57 PM;The game states dream zanarkand is a copy of the real zanarkand back then;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:57 PM;But it doesn't specificy whether Tidus is based on a real person from the past;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:57 PM;It's also a living breathing city;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;He's not;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;yes;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;He's a unique person;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;A descendent of someone who was based on the original Zanarkand.;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;"If he's unique and not based on a human, then he's completely artificial";;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;Thank you fro proving my point;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;You're unique from your great great grandparents;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;Doesn't mean you're artificial;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;I'm also not a dream;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;He's a summon.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;The summons are physical;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:58 PM;Real things;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;Debatable;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;No;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;It's not;;
Asura#5023;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;Didn’t Tidus come back to life;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;Summons like Shiva and Ifrit take many forms;;
Asura#5023;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;At the end of X-2;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;Not in X;;
Asura#5023;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;So he’s a real person now;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;On Spira they have one form;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;It's debatable whether two summoners can call the same aeon at the same time;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;And whether they can regain form after being defeated;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 04:59 PM;It's not up for debate;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:00 PM;There's duels between summoners *in the game*;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:00 PM;They can't summon at the same time;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:00 PM;"If you base that assumption on in-game duels, then also be prepared to explain how them being defeated in battle does not affect their existence";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:00 PM;Because the summons gain physical form by the summoners calling the pyreflies together and channeling the fayth into it;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;They have a physical form;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;Valefor saves Yuna;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;Then what stops pyreflies from multiplying their physical presence;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;Because there's only one fayth;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;That's no excuse;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;...;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;The fayth is the mind of the summon;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:01 PM;"While there's only one fayth, there are many pyreflies, i.e. the channeling method";;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;"I think there's a misunderstanding of the base mechanics of the world here. You brought up pyreflies a lot earlier, but pyreflies are essentially just the representation of life essence or energy in Spira, which can be manifested into other forms and creatures by the dreams of the fayth. Pyreflies are not some super intelligent creatures intentionally piloting Tidus and the summons";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;So?  The fayth can only be in one summon at a time;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;they are simply a conduit to bring the dreams into real physical existence;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;the things they manifest into are real;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;That doesn't mean Tidus is a real human;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;He's biologically the same as a real human;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;"he's not a human, he's a dream of the fayth";;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;but he is real;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;And he has his own thoughts and feelings;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;yes;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;He's real and not a human;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:02 PM;The whole point is that he *has to choose* to defeat Sin;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:03 PM;The fayth can't *make him*.  He's not a blind servant to the Pyreflies;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:03 PM;Or the fayth;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:03 PM;He's a human being with free will;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:03 PM;Aeons have free will too;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:03 PM;The Fayth have a will;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:04 PM;"Jecht has a will as well, when he holds on while in Sin form";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:04 PM;Yes;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:04 PM;"Jecht is also a human, until he dies and becomes Sin.";;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:04 PM;but you have no evidence that all these wills are not the will of nature;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:05 PM;You have no evidence that they are the will of nature.;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:05 PM;My evidence is that they are not based in human existence;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:05 PM;And I would argue that Tidus' character growth is evidence that he makes his choice.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:05 PM;But *they are human*;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:05 PM;Square has said so themselves;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:05 PM;The people of Dream Zanarkand are the *same* as human beings.;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:06 PM;this is true;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:06 PM;I see no source;;

Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:06 PM;No such quote in-game;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:06 PM;"Again, Tidus *develops and grows* as a person.";;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:07 PM;*In the game*;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:07 PM;I don't consider summons to be human;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:07 PM;The fayth are the souls of humans;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:07 PM;"I don't understand. There's no way you played FFX then? You go through the game as Tidus, as he literally *narrates what he feels* and has to *consciously make choices, including one that results in his own demise*";;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:07 PM;how in the world is he not a real character;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:07 PM;He's made up;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;"he's *dreamed* up, and given *real* and *physical* form";;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;he is a real being;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;Unless Yevon literally copy-pasted every single human from Zanarkand;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;"Again, there's nothing pointing to that";;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;except the entirety of FFX;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;We see Tidus as a child;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:08 PM;And he grows into an adult;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:09 PM;Unless he's based on Shuyin;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:09 PM;All within Dream Zanarkand.;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:09 PM;Hes' a descendent of Shuyin;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:09 PM;His growth does not imply he's based on a real Tidus from 1000 years ago;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:10 PM;He's not based on a real Tidus;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:10 PM;He's his own person;;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:10 PM;So the city itself is not based on the old city?;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:10 PM;"I'm not fully understanding the point anymore tbh. Your original point was that he was not real. Human or not, and regardless of being a dream, he is a real and physical being for as long as the fayth continue dreaming said dream, ergo he is a real person";;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:10 PM;Are you denying the whole purpose?;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:10 PM;"The city was made to be a copy, but it grew and evolved on it's own.";;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:11 PM;I don't consider a summoning to be human;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:11 PM;...;;
Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:11 PM;There's no arguing with you.;;

Dinoken2#0946;13-Feb-18 05:12 PM;So bye.;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:12 PM;"again, why does that matter? your original point was him being real or not, what is this about being human suddenly?";;
Kyrel#2632;13-Feb-18 05:12 PM;We get that he exists and all that crap. but how is he human?;;
Lillelaps#8753;13-Feb-18 05:12 PM;"technically he's not human, he is a dream, but he is also real and his own person";;

lilvon#5479;21-Feb-18 03:30 AM;"Yeah that's what im thinking. I was pretty disappointed in the end of the warring Triad Quest when the explained XIVs void, that being said multiple FF characters from other games have showed up in Eorzea so theirs some connection somehow.";;

He reasoned that the struggle to acquire it only to discover it's useless mirrors real life, and thus he was not going to fix the bug. Sakaguchi was irritated by the reply and tried to fix it himself, but the programmer had ciphered the source and Ultima was left the way it was.";;

Dinoken2#0946;09-Mar-18 12:17 PM;"In the Japanese version, Vivi speaks in a certain way that makes him seem more childish.  The ending text after the Mikoto bit is in the same unique way Vivi talks.";;
Dinoken2#0946;09-Mar-18 12:17 PM;It's as confirmed as Laguna being Squall's father IMO.;;

✘Claudio✘#1802;09-Mar-18 02:39 PM;With making games easy I'm moreso a fan of effort ( FF9's Dragon Crest/Thievery & FF8's Lionhart Disc 1 ).;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Mar-18 03:39 PM;You don't need to lower his HP.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;09-Mar-18 03:40 PM;"Also, if I'm not mistaken, you can junction Quistis's card for an item (forget what it's called), and junction *that* for 100 triples (or more, I'll have to check my list when I get home), and you can do that as early as disk 1, Timber.";;

Malfred#1000;12-Mar-18 12:50 PM;There's a decently large sub-plot in XIII-2 about Snow disappearing;;

Hecatia Lapislazuli#5752;12-Mar-18 05:09 PM;it's harder;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;12-Mar-18 05:35 PM;in the manner both @Malfred#1000 & @Lillelaps#8753 explain the plot it's makes sense me has my imagination running wild literally sounds like a complex Disney Adventure but does the game present its story in the same manner you speak of it? should I just wait for a Trilogy Bundle on the PS4 or is that unlikely to happen?;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:39 PM;"the game presents it like that, yeah, although it doesn't explain everything right away and leaves you wondering for a while";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:39 PM;"like for example, the Lightning thing, in XIII's ending she happily leaves with everyone else";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:41 PM;"XIII-2 starts, first thing you see is Lightning in a new realm named Valhalla fighting a certain person as a knight of Etro, that's all you get. Back in the main world with the rest of XIII's cast, everyone remembers Lightning dying/becoming one with Cocoon's pillar as Vanille and Fang did. Only Serah realizes something is amiss and not as it should be, and it's part of what starts her adventure";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:41 PM;and you don't learn the details til quite a ways in;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:42 PM;"also no clue if these games will get PS4 remasters, I have no idea";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:42 PM;if you have a PS3 get them on that;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:42 PM;they're also all on PC but XIII-2's port in particular is kind of ass;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;12-Mar-18 05:46 PM;alright I won't be touching the PC version then how much of a focus is the timer in Lightning Returns;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:47 PM;one of the main game mechanics and constantly there;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:47 PM;you can do some stuff with it like temporarily freeze it or even gain an extra day;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:47 PM;"if you run out of time and fail, you can restart with all of your stuff carrying over";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:47 PM;the game encourages multiple playthroughs;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:48 PM;"you can do ng+ when you win too, of course";;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;12-Mar-18 05:48 PM;oh how do i that any tips? are there multiple endings in these? games?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;12-Mar-18 05:48 PM;The timer in 13-3 is not that big a deal;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:48 PM;the game will teach you when you get to it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;12-Mar-18 05:49 PM;You can finish all the main bosses before day 6;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:49 PM;no multiple endings but XIII-2 has a short secret ending scene and a few non-canon paradox endings;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;12-Mar-18 05:49 PM;Also you can play 13-2 on PC but you have to fix it and I have a guide for that;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:50 PM;it's still not ideal;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:50 PM;it doesn't want to run at a decent framerate no matter what;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;12-Mar-18 05:50 PM;No but you do get all the DLC for free;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:50 PM;you can just buy the dlc bundle off psn too;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:50 PM;the game itself on PS3 can't cost that much;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;12-Mar-18 05:52 PM;"ah DLC you shouldn't of told me about the DLC did those final fantasy10 and 12 remaster, final fantasy type-0 sale well because if they did i think i'll hold out for the trilogy, I did order FF13 earlier today unsure if it has any DLC";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:53 PM;"nah, the original XIII has no dlc";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:53 PM;XIII-2 has three story episodes and a bunch of outfits and a few weapons and a bunch of fun arena boss fights;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:53 PM;Lighting Returns has outfits also;;
La Bête du Gévaudan#7425;12-Mar-18 05:56 PM;"oh okay i think i'll wait for the possible bundle, are you picking ff7 remake by the there been mentioned  more plans then a mention it will be split into parts like the ff13 saga.";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:59 PM;are you asking if I plan on picking up FF7R?;;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:59 PM;"I do, yeah";;
Lillelaps#8753;12-Mar-18 05:59 PM;I don't mind it being in parts;;

Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:16 AM;this;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:16 AM;was the hardest FF for me to beat;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:16 AM;because of how boring it is;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:20 AM;"i've played RPGs worse than this (like, Stargazer) but this thing is a bit aggravating with its purpose (and how bad it is as a tool to teach/get someone engaged into JRPG)";;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:24 AM;Super Mario RPG for snes is a way better game as someone's introduction;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:35 AM;the final boss is hilarious;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 08:35 AM;Cure to him is worse than cancer;;
IYNH#5142;17-Mar-18 08:37 AM;a few minutes into FFTA and I think the game is about gang wars;;
Silverx1987#9781;17-Mar-18 08:38 AM;Kids in gangs? Nonsense!;;
IYNH#5142;17-Mar-18 08:38 AM;I blame that asshat Montblanc;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 08:54 AM;Lol;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 08:54 AM;But I had a shitty theory once;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 08:54 AM;Where Marche and his friendos were on drugs;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 08:55 AM;And they were actually hurting real people;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 08:55 AM;Montblanc and the other sidekicks were probably accomplices or something;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 08:55 AM;The Judges are just policemen;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:01 AM;And Li-Grim was probably Mewts mom when was angry or something;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:02 AM;And they actually managed to kill her;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:06 AM;And as for the races;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:06 AM;Bangaas could be adults;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:06 AM;Nu mous could be old men;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:07 AM;Vieras are girls;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:07 AM;Moogles are Children;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:07 AM;Humes/Humans are just Marches age;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:07 AM;So fuck;;
IYNH#5142;17-Mar-18 09:07 AM;pretty sure Marche's gang is the mafia;;
IYNH#5142;17-Mar-18 09:08 AM;hell bent on liberating ivalice or something;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 09:08 AM;So who's the REAL mastermind behind all this;;
IYNH#5142;17-Mar-18 09:09 AM;Marche's gang also tries to slaughter other wandering gangs I think;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 09:12 AM;"WesleyB #FF 'thon MQ/15: oh my god, WesleyB #FF 'thon MQ/15: i realized something utterly horrible, WesleyB #FF 'thon MQ/15: Mystic Quest is so comparable to FFXIII its not funny, , i need more beer";;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:16 AM;Oh fuck;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:16 AM;But why;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 10:17 AM;he's *THUNDERHEAD*;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:17 AM;He's a pineapple;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:21 AM;I don't get this Marche is the true villain theory and it's backstory;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:21 AM;Can someone that knows this explain to me?;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;17-Mar-18 10:28 AM;his convictions and what he does throughout the game.. is pretty unlikeable;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:28 AM;Ah;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:29 AM;So his actions are just;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:29 AM;Bad;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:35 AM;But who made him do all this;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;17-Mar-18 10:35 AM;Or was it just him;;
Thelitedragon#4507;17-Mar-18 10:36 AM;It was... you!;;

Thelitedragon#4507;17-Mar-18 07:56 PM;Oh I wiped the last half of the game out of my memory;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;17-Mar-18 07:57 PM;At least I hope not;;

Thelitedragon#4507;17-Mar-18 08:00 PM;If you thought it was bad before then hoo boy;;

LittleBlessedVillain#0954;18-Mar-18 04:06 AM;So it's like a reverse XIII?;;
IYNH#5142;18-Mar-18 04:44 AM;a downward slope is arguably better than an upward one though;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;18-Mar-18 09:16 AM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Renko Usami#3990;18-Mar-18 10:06 AM;So I just thought of a question. How come Yuna can't perform any summons in X-2 But she can in the original X? There a lore detail I missed somehow?;;
Renko Usami#3990;18-Mar-18 10:06 AM;"And yes, I did post this here and not questions just in case it is a spoiler.";;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;18-Mar-18 10:07 AM;I assume because the Fayth removed their blessing for people to use summons?;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;18-Mar-18 10:08 AM;I don't remember if that ever explicitly happened but I figure that was part of ultimately defeating Sin.;;
Silverx1987#9781;18-Mar-18 10:09 AM;People lost Fayth in religion.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;18-Mar-18 10:10 AM;didn't all of the aeons die though?;;
LittleBlessedVillain#0954;18-Mar-18 10:10 AM;"Oh, that might have been part of it.";;

Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 04:32 PM;Great value;;
Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 04:33 PM;2.8 cost a bit much for what it was when it came out imo but eh;;
Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 04:33 PM;Dream Drop Distance best KH game so I had to buy;;

Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 04:58 PM;"probably the best of the KH remasters in that sense, they did some stuff";;
Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 04:59 PM;"2.8 has A Fragmentary Passage and Back Cover too but tbf one is like 4 hours long and the other is a movie so while neat, yeah";;
Socindwich#0753;21-Mar-18 05:00 PM;Fragmentary is 2 hours long;;
Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 05:01 PM;"it's definitely not 2 hours unless you're actually just rushing it, skipping everything possible";;
Lillelaps#8753;21-Mar-18 05:01 PM;"but yeah the point still remains that it's essentially just a demo, even if it's a story sequence that's not actually in KH3 itself";;

Socindwich#0753;22-Mar-18 03:25 PM;Remember to wait for shadow;;
Thelitedragon#4507;22-Mar-18 03:25 PM;Always wait for Shadow;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Mar-18 03:25 PM;"`Woahhhh i think i just found a ninja with a dlggo who does shadow stuff` I won't get into details but if you get him in your party either A) Save right before each battle/save very often or B) Go back to Narshe, and swap him out and 2) Wait for Shadow, way later in the game";;

TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:36 PM;It's not about speedrunning lol;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:37 PM;It's about the game having really slow walk animations;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:37 PM;Plus FF5 had a run button... and I think 4 did too;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:38 PM;Im aware;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:38 PM;"Well, there's no reason to not use the run button lol";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:38 PM;Who plays Ocarina of Time walking everywhere?;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:38 PM;Actually sliding everywhere;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:39 PM;"Exactly, everybody rolls in that game because there's no reason to go slow when you can go faster lol";;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:39 PM;No not rolling sliding two different things;;
Socindwich#0753;22-Mar-18 03:39 PM;V Snes didn't have a run button;;

TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:39 PM;You run and more enemies show up more often;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;22-Mar-18 03:39 PM;"`Psychotic Ninja knows you can't too, they're just not really paying attention to the conversation lol` Actually it's been a while, and I don't know 6 very well, I've only beaten it once.";;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:40 PM;Nope HESS aka Hyper Extended Super Slide;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:40 PM;Also your not crazy random encounters in the classic use a step counter system;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:41 PM;"Well I mean, HESS is speed running stuff lol";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;22-Mar-18 03:41 PM;Most people me included never even heard of it;;

pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:41 PM;Well it was more a joke if anything xD;;
Socindwich#0753;22-Mar-18 03:41 PM;I'm pretty sure every step has a fairly low chance of an encounter;;
Socindwich#0753;22-Mar-18 03:41 PM;And you just walk a lot;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:42 PM;Every step rerolls the seed to initiate an encounter. With a proper setup you can abuse this to avoid most encounters;;
Socindwich#0753;22-Mar-18 03:44 PM;My main issue with IV is the extremely high encounter rate;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:44 PM;That can be mitigated;;
Socindwich#0753;22-Mar-18 03:44 PM;meh;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-Mar-18 03:45 PM;Theres an easy way to avoid encounters without a setup by saving and resetting;;

IYNH#5142;24-Mar-18 10:48 AM;idk about abusing elemental affinities in FF games tbh;;
IYNH#5142;24-Mar-18 10:48 AM;it's kinda weird;;
IYNH#5142;24-Mar-18 10:50 AM;Scanning and viewing enemy affinity information is often not very easy I would say;;
IYNH#5142;24-Mar-18 10:51 AM;"and towards the end of the game, enemy seems to just come closer and closer to the I resist every element and status effects mark";;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 11:33 AM;There's a definite shift in most FF games where the best option is to spam nonelemental spells;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Mar-18 11:41 AM;I usually go with the tried and true hit them with the big stick until they bleed method;;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 11:44 AM;It's a hard stick to balance.;;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 11:44 AM;FF4 is the worst offender of this to be perfectly honest.;;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 11:44 AM;"There's a point where you start casting Bio, and then there's a point where you start casting Bahamut. There's really no in between.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Mar-18 11:46 AM;I almost never cast Bio. The only real status effect spell I use in 4 is Slow.;;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 12:03 PM;Bio is non elemental damage in 4;;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 12:12 PM;"It also does Sap, which can be useful";;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 12:12 PM;It's super useful for most of the game till you get end game summons.;;
Chimpy#5375;24-Mar-18 12:12 PM;Especially since it's also relatively cheap.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Mar-18 12:22 PM;"That may be true, but hitting enemies with a big stick hasn't failed me yet";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Mar-18 12:26 PM;"Hell, my first playthrough of FF4DS (not as a whole, just that version), I didn't bother with my augments, thinking they were useless.

Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Mar-18 12:28 PM;"Sure, Cecil lasted longer than Rydia, Edge, and Rosa (they normally would die by the first Big Bang), but Cecil usually died by the 2nd or 3rd Big Bang";;
pokemongenius#1474;24-Mar-18 12:28 PM;Yup everyone whos ever played FF4 DS will tell you its hard;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Mar-18 12:32 PM;"But yeah, normally I don't use/need to use spells and summons, even with Black/White, and Summoners in my party. At least, I didn't. I mean, I use them now, but only to change things up, not out of necessity.";;

Chimpy#5375;28-Mar-18 07:45 PM;Final Fantasy 3 might be the best game on the NES too.;;
Silverx1987#9781;28-Mar-18 07:45 PM;Especially the one where you have to get level 99 with all jobs.;;

Socindwich#0753;28-Mar-18 08:43 PM;Only for it to be ruined much later when they're okay I guess hahaha;;

Socindwich#0753;29-Mar-18 08:00 AM;I mean;;

Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;29-Mar-18 08:04 AM;Faris has boob armor in afterlife and that bothers me;;
Chimpy#5375;29-Mar-18 08:04 AM;A personal anecdote doesn't really stop it from ruining it for other people. I can bring up how my sister immediately recognized Faris as a woman due to the portrait. I find the less hints drawn to it the better.;;

TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:24 AM;15 is one of my more favorite games in the series at this point;;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:24 AM;which is your favourite;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:25 AM;I love how 15 manages to evoke feelings and little parts from every other game in the series;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:25 AM;Towards the beginning when you have to do that mission with the giant bird you have to sneak past?;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:25 AM;TOTALLY took me back to running into Bahamut towards the beginning of FF3 and having to GTFO of there asap;;

TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:27 AM;Several times lol;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:28 AM;That boss fight more than ever proved to me that they *REALLY* needed to do more work on Noctis' character;;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:28 AM;the yuou kill it;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:28 AM;If you try to actually fight it with weapons......;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:28 AM;A lot of the lockon points are buried deep in it's body;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;So Noct doesn't really want to combo them;;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;i was pussy so i just used the ring;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;But for some reason other characters had no problem;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;Iggy could combo them just fine;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;But noct would act like they were too far away;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;I mean;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:29 AM;There's nothing to be afraid of in that boss fight;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:30 AM;It's so big that it doesn't really have any potential to attack you lol;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:30 AM;It's attacks are so big and so slow and telegraphed;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:30 AM;I had more trouble with tiny enemies in this game lol;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:31 AM;Eventually I did use the ring too though because it just takes too damn long otherwise;;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:31 AM;i defeated ity before ardyn so the final dungeon was pretty easy;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:32 AM;I couldn't go back while the story was still going;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:32 AM;Not until I got to Insomnia;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:32 AM;I just couldn't bring myself to.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:33 AM;Was too worried about Prompto and then Noct lol;;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:33 AM;yeah i only returned before insomnia;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:33 AM;"Man, the story really threw me for a damn loop though";;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:33 AM;i cant bring myself to play it after the end knowing noctis is dead;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:33 AM;I could have sworn they were building up to every other character in the group dying for Noct and Noct living happily ever after with Lunafreya;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:34 AM;But then they kill her off early and turns out he's the one who has to die;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:34 AM;Somehow that made it worse;;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:34 AM;i didnt care musch for luna tbh;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:34 AM;"I mean, she was fine. You don't see enough of her to really get to know her like the main characters";;
Giorno Giovanna#3410;01-Apr-18 08:35 AM;i wouldve liked more regis;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:35 AM;But she was going around ahead of the team and setting things up so that the Aeons would join us;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:35 AM;Man lol;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:35 AM;The ending to this game though can lead to some hilarious memes;;

TheGreatMax6713#8880;01-Apr-18 08:38 AM;Noct is by far the most useless in the group;;

Laboom#4677;04-Apr-18 03:58 PM;If you are a sucker for romance and awesome stories get 9 and 10. If you love great graphics and don't mind drama and tragedy then get 15.;;
Laboom#4677;04-Apr-18 03:58 PM;Although I guess all ff have drama and tragedy;;
Laboom#4677;04-Apr-18 03:59 PM;Not sure how to describe it better in a nutshell;;
🅶🅰🅻🅰🅲🆃🅸🅲  Bambi#4955;04-Apr-18 03:59 PM;Yeah i beat 15 and it was the first game i cried to tbh xD 7 i came close but not quite;;

Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;05-Apr-18 01:02 AM;"After all, having our characters get sidetracked to do some other stuff other than their Focus would be really dissonant to the plot.";;

Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;05-Apr-18 01:03 AM;Pushing this game design for more than 2 hours is going to test the audience's patience.;;

pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:29 PM;Neither game has endgame content.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:41 PM;About to become a paladin.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:43 PM;Protect the weak;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:44 PM;I always wonder if Cecil never became a paladin what would the plot significance would be like.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:44 PM;Since I think the only time it's a factor is when he has to use the crystal against Zeromus.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:44 PM;He'd be stuck being an indecisive mess inable to conquer his inner conflicts;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:45 PM;"Well, in theory he'd have to find another way around it and come to terms. Could do a whole dark isn't evil type of story with that.";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:46 PM;Yes however the issue here is he was never evil in the first place he only was following orders;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:47 PM;I never implied he was evil as a dark knight. He thinks he's evil though. The story would be him finding a way to accept that his powers of darkness doesn't innately make him a bad person.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:49 PM;I see what your sayin. I think the problem with that is darkness poses him as evil to others but he'd rather be seen as a good person.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:52 PM;Literally every game after FF4 were Cecil appears in he does follow the darkness doesnt make him a bad person setup;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:54 PM;Yeah;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:54 PM;I'm thinking in terms when the game originally came out;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:54 PM;Especially after it was such a big deal that light and dark have a balance in FF3.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:55 PM;Well americans didnt get that memo till a decade later;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 08:56 PM;Still would of been interesting even without that though.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 08:57 PM;It'd be lost in translation with FF3 in mind. At least FF4 isnt a sequel to 3 that would make things more confusing;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:00 PM;Not particularly. It's not like FF4 would of been the first dark isn't evil story in media in the west.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:00 PM;It'd just be an introduction to it for a lot of children.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:01 PM;Not that I would want it gone. Cecil's journey to becoming a paladin is easily the best part of the game for me. It's all downhill after this.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:01 PM;True but being tied to FF3 like your earlier comment would get lost in transition;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:01 PM;Yes;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:02 PM;Also i disagree FF4 is solid the whole way imo;;
🅶🅰🅻🅰🅲🆃🅸🅲  Bambi#4955;05-Apr-18 09:03 PM;Yeah i just realized how dumb it was of me to even think about getting the royal edition full game on ps4 when i already have the game on x box one... All i need to do is put the dlc on x box one;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:03 PM;I just don't find anything as exciting after this point.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:03 PM;The only thing that kind of tickles me still is Rydia's return.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:03 PM;The moon doh;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:03 PM;To be honest.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:03 PM;Doesn't do anything for me.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:04 PM;"I dare say FF IV is the most polished game in the series, at least for the PSP version";;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:04 PM;"It has the least amount of reasons to hate it, tbh lol";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:04 PM;Id like to tell your wrong b4 the updates but yes PSP did good;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:05 PM;I don't really see it to be honest. The gameplay is really weak and the story doesn't really wow me nearly as much after the first opening hours.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:05 PM;The climax of the game for me is Cecil becoming a paladin.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:06 PM;The rest of it is just another 30/40 hours of prodding to beat in a space flea.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:06 PM;30/40? I beat it in 20h lol;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:06 PM;Well before 4 was a job game which is more interesting gameplay wise but 4 fixed alot which persists in every FF afterward;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:08 PM;Hopefully it's only 20hs.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:08 PM;I wanna get to the best mainline FF game.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:08 PM;"But I get you, @Chimpy#5375. I kinda felt the same with IX. I enjoyed it, but it didn't live up to the hype people put on me.";;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:09 PM;It's been only 10 years since I last played it all the way through.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:09 PM;FF4 I mean.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:09 PM;Which version are you playing right now?;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:09 PM;"I highly recommend playing the PSP version, or the DS one if you want a challenge";;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:09 PM;I played FF2 USA hard type last year;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:12 PM;SNES version since original versions for now.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:12 PM;When I hit FF7 I'll be doing PC releases for a bit.;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:12 PM;Could emulate PSX version though;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:12 PM;Not as big of a difference between PSX FF7 vs PC FF7 though these days.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:12 PM;There's an original graphics option for the PC version;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:13 PM;I think Magic Resistance working is the biggest change lol.;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:13 PM;Nope;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:13 PM;"Yeah, I also installed the mod that fixed mouths a while back";;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:13 PM;I'd probably recommend emulating VIII though;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:14 PM;Fixed the audio for that one too;;
Marcello#4574;05-Apr-18 09:14 PM;The PC version is just a pain. I modded it just to get the controller prompts right and better font (besides the music);;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:15 PM;Debating what I'll do with the side games in my A lot of FF playthroughs;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:15 PM;I don't think I'll be doing TAY after this;;
pokemongenius#1474;05-Apr-18 09:16 PM;Oh god TAY:hit:;;
Chimpy#5375;05-Apr-18 09:17 PM;I don't think I can stomach more FF4;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Apr-18 05:38 PM;"Well, 10 handles it in a unique way. First, there's the weapon itself. In some cases, getting the weapon is easy, others not so much. Then, you need to get their respective ~~Tags~~ Crests and Sigils. The crests are easy. The sigils are a pain in the ass. Probably the most frustrating things in all gaming history.";;

🅶🅰🅻🅰🅲🆃🅸🅲  Bambi#4955;07-Apr-18 05:49 PM;"also Ifrit is such a weak summon isn't he xD like in ff15 he was one of the last bosses, i wish i fought ramuh in that game that would have been so fun :0";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Apr-18 05:55 PM;"There are some reoccurring summons, like Ifrit and Shiva";;

assholemon#0823;13-Apr-18 12:20 AM;"also, who's your best character?";;
assholemon#0823;13-Apr-18 12:20 AM;or your favorite;;

Yukito#2049;14-Apr-18 02:25 PM;Since the enemy's level is determined by the average of your currenty party's levels;;

Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;14-Apr-18 02:44 PM;it came out a week before X.. let me look that up;;
Wesley Basil Crowen#3748;14-Apr-18 02:45 PM;over four years.. meaning that it started developing somewhere in 1997;;
Silverx1987#9781;14-Apr-18 02:45 PM;I do know that Spirit Within came out the summer when I graduated elementary school.;;
Silverx1987#9781;14-Apr-18 02:46 PM;Because I went to see it in theatres with three friends that were friends with my girlfriend who has just moved away.;;
Silverx1987#9781;14-Apr-18 02:47 PM;So it was probably July or August of 2001.;;
Yukito#2049;14-Apr-18 02:50 PM;"To think. If they hadn't made that movie, FFVIII could have spelled atmosphere correctly";;
Yukito#2049;14-Apr-18 02:51 PM;That's honestly a much better use of money by miles XD;;

Yukito#2049;14-Apr-18 02:53 PM;Since Atomos doesn't appear at all in FF8 and the context was they were trying to get back to their planet from spaaaaaaace;;

IYNH#5142;23-Apr-18 02:58 AM;How many spell charges have you drawn until this point;;
IYNH#5142;23-Apr-18 02:58 AM;Have you reached 1000 yet;;
Silver Haku#5279;23-Apr-18 03:02 AM;Isn't the Max 99?;;
IYNH#5142;23-Apr-18 03:13 AM;Max is 100;;
IYNH#5142;23-Apr-18 03:13 AM;And I'm asking about total amount of charges across all characters;;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Apr-18 07:13 AM;"Well assuming you have Fire, Esuna, Cure, Blizzard, Thunder, Blind, Water, Fira, Thundara, Cura, Bio, Silence, Demi, Break you should have 1600 magics stocked";;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Apr-18 07:16 AM;That is the most you can have on a single character before fighting Elvoret just multiply by each character available up to that point which is 4 including the temporary Seifer you get a grand total of 6400;;
CupcakeGamer#1065;23-Apr-18 07:36 AM;"Or, (if you’ve played this game so many times you don’t care any more) you use the magic booster from stream and start with 100 of every mid level Magic";;

XTale!Undyne (Rpggamer02)#8669;23-Apr-18 07:37 AM;But its really hard one;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 07:48 AM;I honestly don't know what to think of VIII so far;;
CarpeDiem#9076;23-Apr-18 12:46 PM;Ff viii is the best ff;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 01:07 PM;"OH GOD, I REALIZED:, Garland = Gaarando = Gallant, It's like, his name sounds like Gallant, BTW, i finished Final Fantasy II NES version right now ^_^, I love the Pandaemonium music, And Battle Theme of FFII is the one i sing along in battles ^_^, Many iconic FiFaMon got introduced there ^_^, Bombs, Flans (They were in FF1, but got their iconic style here), Imps, Adamantoise, Gigantoad, Coeurl, Lamia, Iron Giant... and, of course, The King of Beasts - BEHEMOTH, I don't even know which theme to associate with him... Battle Theme 2, Battle Theme A or OMNIS LACRIMA.(изменено), I would love a remake of FFII with expanded Story, Like, i found that there are 4 Great Demons in Pandameonium., Tiamat, Beelzebub, Astaroth and Emperor";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 01:25 PM;FF2 isn't goood though;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 01:26 PM;Lots of traditions and stuff were introduced yes but that doesn't excuse the horribly broken and unbalanced gameplay progression system;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 01:30 PM;The dungeon design is atrocious;;
XTale!Undyne (Rpggamer02)#8669;23-Apr-18 01:30 PM;i dont like 2 anything about the game only the story and the design is so strange;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 01:31 PM;The emperor is F tier in terms of interesting villains;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 01:34 PM;He does interesting things but that's really it;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:03 PM;"@Socindwich#0753 Ah, come on. Those dungeons are far better than the ones from FF1.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:04 PM;"And Dungeon design is good, ...Visually., , I love how Cyclone Fotress changes from a Solid Clouds to Castle., Or how Castle Pandaemonium becomes from a castle to a crystallized space";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:05 PM;"...Well, only in NES version, as in future re-releases they messed those designs up, and now Cyclone is just a castle, and Pandaemonium is a whole crystal";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:05 PM;"And... um... Emperor, in my opinion, is better than Kefka";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:05 PM;His actions speak for himself:;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:06 PM;Emperor destroyed 80% of the world's population (From beginning of the game to the end);;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:06 PM;As for writing...               We have to think for ourselves.        And he's more explained in the Novel.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:06 PM;"Just because the story is written in a few words doesn't mean that it's bad., That means that it's the story that you must think for yourself";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:07 PM;"It's like modern people want the stories to always explain everything with words..., , People say Show, Don't Tell but they still want everyone to tell them what is this story is.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:07 PM;"Final Fantasy II does a lot Show, Don't Tell but people dislike it... heh.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:10 PM;"Either way, it's not like i love FFII.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:10 PM;I just reworked my view of this game.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:10 PM;"If you can't enjoy it, then make yourself enjoy it ^_^";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:14 PM;I can't make myself enjoy it because it's so unbelievably boring;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:15 PM;It's not boring to me.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:15 PM;It's as boring as any other Final Fantasy.;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:15 PM;The dungeons are a giant fuck you choose a door or fight 3 worthless battles;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:15 PM;"Which means, if it's boring to you, then it's boring";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:16 PM;3 worthless battles? What?;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:16 PM;They never fight more than one time in those rooms;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:16 PM;Sometimes they don't even attack;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:16 PM;Literally my biggest problem is the progression system;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:16 PM;"Progression system is good...                ...If you use cheats., I divided the game in 16 story arcs, and in each story arc i raise my strength up one level ^_^";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:17 PM;"Progression system is okay, when you know what you WANT to level up. You need to choose";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:17 PM;"Either way, it's not like Sa-Ga series is bad, right? It has similar leveling system., And People of Yapan love it";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:18 PM;"There's only 3 good weapon types, leveling up spells is boring, you just grind and grind and grind for an hour before feeling a tangible difference";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:19 PM;"Ah, you don't need to overlevel.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:19 PM;"And GBA PSP versions have easier leveling system, as early levels are easy to aqcuire";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:19 PM;Sure just keep casting fire and blizzard and thunder over and over again on yourself;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:19 PM;"Well, so?             In other FF games just spam attack button ^_^";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:19 PM;No difference ^_^;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;"Dude, why are you making excuses? It's clear that you can't make coherent arguement here";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;Then don't hit yourself;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;Let the enemies do it ^_^;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;But you literally have to;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;You don't have to;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;If you don't grind you'll die;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:20 PM;If you grind you're overpowered;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;No in between;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;"Dude, 1000 HP is enough for even near-engame";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;Exactly;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;200 HP is enough at beginning;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;"There is between, silly";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;No there is not;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;level 3 is enough to get in Bafsk Cave;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;Level 4 is enough for Snow Cave;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;and 400 HP is enough for them;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:21 PM;You either destroy your enemies or they destroy you;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:22 PM;"Dude, are you created those lines yourself?, O";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:22 PM;Or are you just copying from other people?;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:22 PM;I heard those words already in many topics.;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:22 PM;You end up overleveling anyway to afford the stupidly expensive equipment;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:22 PM;You have no opinion of this game. You're just copying other people's opinion ^_^;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:23 PM;Oi.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:23 PM;"You see Everyone hates FFII, so i must too kek";;

Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:23 PM;I literally played this game;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:23 PM;And I hate it;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:23 PM;@Socindwich#0753 PFFT... you never played worse;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:23 PM;Respect other people's opinions;;

KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:24 PM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 I respect them. ^_^, It's just he tries to explain how this game is Horrible to me.";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Apr-18 02:24 PM;Didn't we boot this guy for this same kinda shit like two months ago;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:24 PM;"If it's horrible to him, then that's his opinion";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:24 PM;...Okay then.;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:24 PM;I wasn't even here 2 months ago;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:24 PM;But then why he doesn't like that this game is good to me?;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;@Socindwich#0753 They talk about me;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;Because he is trying to explain why he holds the opinion that he has;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;It doesn't need to be an argument;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;"I just said that this game is good, and he started to explain why this game is horrible ^_^";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;And you said he's just copying other peoples' opinions;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;You're in the wrong here;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 Well, i try to explain my opinion";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;Sit down;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:25 PM;"..Okay then, i decided to act edgy 😛";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:26 PM;Sorry;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:26 PM;~~Saying the dungeons are better than ff1 is objectively wrong though~~;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:26 PM;I will stop being edgy now;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:26 PM;@Socindwich#0753 Really? Visual Designs are much better;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:26 PM;"A lot of variety. Snow Cave, Jungle Cave, Castle, Airship, Cloud Castle, Crystal Castle... a lot of designs";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:27 PM;I felt such thrill as i explored Pandaemonium;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:27 PM;let me explain... i didn't cared much for FF2's gameplay;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:27 PM;"I heard about these other opinions yes, so I played the game for myself and thought the same things";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:27 PM;"I just love it's visuals and music... in the NES version., And it's design and atmosphere";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:27 PM;"@Socindwich#0753 YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE!, I did the same thing too when i first played it";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:28 PM;"When i first played it, i heard negative reviews, so i had negative opinion of this game too.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:28 PM;And used the same arguements as you;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:28 PM;But don't you find it interesting how i changed my views on this game?;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:28 PM;I didn't;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:29 PM;Okay then;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:29 PM;"...Really, though?, A person who had the same views as you, now thinks differently..., Don't you find that interesting?";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:29 PM;Sure;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;Okay then.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;"Either way, FFII has a lot of great music";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;Finale is one of the best Credits songs of FF games;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;Rebel Army Theme is gorgeous;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;Pandaemonium is epic;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;Not a single remaster fixed the chocobo theme however;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:30 PM;And i always humm Battle themes;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:31 PM;"@Socindwich#0753 ...Because if they would fix Chocobo theme, then it would be a remake";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:31 PM;"But look at it from 1989 eyes., There was no other Chocobo theme at the time";;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:31 PM;4 bars of music is repetitive no matter what;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:31 PM;They could have done much better;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:32 PM;@Thelitedragon#4507 It's like you have to ride a Chocobo for 5 minutes;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:32 PM;Plenty of time to go insane;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:34 PM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 They?, Who they? Uematsu?";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:34 PM;I also don't like constantly back tracking to the same town;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:34 PM;Yes Uematsu;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:34 PM;@Socindwich#0753 There was no other way to prolong this game;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:35 PM;Backtracking was the way for those games to be long enough to be fair of it's price in 1980's;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:35 PM;"Those games costed big, so they need to have a lot of time to be infested.";;

Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:35 PM;But FF1 did that better in that regard however;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Apr-18 02:35 PM;Quite so;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;@Socindwich#0753 Ohh... yeeeeeah... riiight...           Like Marsh Cave and Terra Cave?;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;Where you have to come into Marsh Cave two times to get new weapons with a key?;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;What;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;It's literally just 2 times;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;"And Terra Cave where you go inside 3 floors, then go back to the entrance, then again 3 floors deep plus 2 floors";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;FFII has no such things;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:36 PM;And you don't even have to do it;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:37 PM;"With Terra cave, YOU HAVE.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:37 PM;"Terra Cave is one of most annoying aspects of FF1..., ...Though, FF1 still remains my msot played FF game ^_^ I finished it for more than 10 times ^_^";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:38 PM;"While FFII, you get Warp and Teleport early on (If you visit Bafks)";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:38 PM;"And you can do it in every dungeon., EVEN PANDAEMONIUM";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:38 PM;"Yes, you can teleport from Pandaemonium";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:38 PM;...Same with Chaos Shrine in FF1. You can go all the way to Final Boss... and go back.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:39 PM;"And then go again, but now with Masamune already.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:39 PM;Same with Pandaemonium in FFII.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:39 PM;"I do believe, you can warp from Crystal Tower in FFIII too.. let me check";;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:39 PM;I don't see much of a reason to play either games when ff3 exists;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:40 PM;Not from the dark world but the crystal tower yes;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:40 PM;But you need to go through the labyrinth again;;
Socindwich#0753;23-Apr-18 02:42 PM;But at that point you're practically done with the game anyway so what's the point;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:46 PM;"Huh, you can't cast Exit in Crystal Tower...";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:47 PM;"Yeah, but...";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:47 PM;After you reach the room with Dragons... you can just go back outside and save;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:47 PM;"More than that, you can go to Eureka, and then go back to save, and then start exploring Cyrcus Tower";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:48 PM;And Warp doesn't work either...;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:49 PM;"Still, after you go up Crystal Tower, you can go back and exit Crystal Tower. And then save";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:49 PM;This way you will get stronger every time you enter.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:49 PM;That's how old RPG worked.;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:50 PM;I played and finished Megami Tensei 1...;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:50 PM;"The original, NES version.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:51 PM;"And it worked like this. You go to dungeon, make some progress, and then return. Then refight your way in, explore a little more, and then return when you get weaker... and so on.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:51 PM;"This way, you always explore more and more.";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:51 PM;Modern RPGs are letting you to finish the dungeon in one go... but old RPGs weren't like that;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:54 PM;"BTW, playing FFXV...";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:54 PM;"Right now, it's more enjoyable PERSONALLY TO ME that Zelda Breath of the Wild...";;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:54 PM;Because FFXV has DUNGEONS! ^_^;;
KT1#1210;23-Apr-18 02:55 PM;"I explored Costlemark Tower today, and it was GODLY. , I love dungeons in games! ^_^";;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;24-Apr-18 07:20 PM;"Oh I didn't have dual wield, and I was a blue mage";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;24-Apr-18 07:20 PM;Maybe that's why I lost;;
IYNH#5142;24-Apr-18 07:20 PM;The main point with the battle is that you have to use jugglers to help putting your melee fighter of choice in position;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;24-Apr-18 07:21 PM;The only juggle person I have is montcunt;;
IYNH#5142;24-Apr-18 07:21 PM;I used montblanc + 1 generic moogle;;

Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:16 AM;"I love how in a lot of cutscenes, they just show Lulu from the waist up so they don't have to worry about what to do with all those damn belts.";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:17 AM;But what about all those shots that just show her cleavage and nothing else while talking about something completely unrelated;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 02:18 AM;One of the cutscene animators was probably horny when they made them;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:19 AM;"Well, the main demographic is young men.";;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 02:19 AM;Maybe the horny animator was a woman;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 02:19 AM;"Either way, they were feeling a bit randy";;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:19 AM;very possible;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:19 AM;Fujoshi's exist;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 02:20 AM;Interfered with their work;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:20 AM;Actually a lot of the camera work was just sloppy;;

Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:22 AM;Sloppy indeed;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:23 AM;ughhh i hate Lulu so much for the reasons above;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:23 AM;i've been really annoyed this playthrough with all the boob shots and close-ups;;

Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 02:24 AM;Okay I'm done.;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:24 AM;That's really not on Lulu's character though;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:24 AM;"it'd be at least make a bit of sense if her character was flirtatious or light-headed, but she's a super taciturn, no-bullshit character so it's just weird";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:25 AM;Whoever's job it was to handle the camera fucked up;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:25 AM;Most of those shots are pretty *sloppy*;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:25 AM;"i'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it's kind of a japanese/anime cinematic trope";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:25 AM;And all over the place;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:25 AM;"yeah, that is true";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:25 AM;Not in the way they did it;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:26 AM;That was just boob shots in the middle of a normal convo;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:26 AM;Or weird scroll shots;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:26 AM;As I'm playing VII right now the closest thing I can relate it to is that;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:27 AM;"The use of Dutch shots is perfect, only using it when Sephiroth goes insane adding a bit of dread and it always shows what's going on fully, always in frame";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:28 AM;While the opposite is true for x;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:28 AM;"Just a nitpick i have, x is still my favorite ff";;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:28 AM;I have a lot of love for X;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:28 AM;"and surprisingly, a lot of love for X-2";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:29 AM;Ehhh;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:29 AM;Not a fan of x-2 but I can see why someone would like it;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:29 AM;"agreed, silver. also, good eye on the dutch angles: FFVII is the only FF to have adequately used them";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:29 AM;Its serviceable in my books;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:29 AM;"VIII kind of did also, but it was weird in IX and beyond";;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:29 AM;"Like, if you filter the bullshit from X-2, the actual plot feels like a natural extension of Yuna's character to me.";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:30 AM;X-2 was when SE dropped the ball on gratuitousness to me. the whole damn thing is unncessary;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:31 AM;"even if it were good--which it isn't, apart from the battle system and some character bits--i wouldve still been annoyed with it";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:32 AM;Agreed it was unnecessary;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:34 AM;--will-- and x-2.5 are still dumpster fires that shouldn't exist and purposely go out of its way to try and ruin x;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:35 AM;Where as x just felt like a weird spinoff I could just deal with;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:35 AM;Don't consider that cannon;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:35 AM;X ended perfectly;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:35 AM;And I'm fine with that;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:36 AM;Can I actually just rant for abit;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:37 AM;Did you see --will-- and x-2.5;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:37 AM;Because oh boy;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:37 AM;"sadly, I did";;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:37 AM;I try to forget;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:37 AM;And think of better times.;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:38 AM;I wish I could forget;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:38 AM;But now every time I think about how much I love x;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:38 AM;I can't help but think of how much I despise *those*;;

Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:40 AM;"But yeah, I heard that theory Carmine.";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:40 AM;maybe im just unsent;;

Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:41 AM;"I don't support that theory either, but it is intresting";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:41 AM;"yeah, same here, but it's a neat little theory";;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:41 AM;Better then 7 and 10 being connected;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:41 AM;Fight me;;

Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:41 AM;HA;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:41 AM;"yeah, i'll admit the VII-X connection is a stretch";;

Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:42 AM;"X is very left up to interpretation, one of the reasons I love it";;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:42 AM;and after seeing the wall of people...;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:42 AM;"same here, that's why i thought X's ending is great";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;in desolated Zanarkand;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;it's literally a wall of people trying to keep Zanarkand alive;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;The wall of people was on Gagazet.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;and their will is so strong that;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;yea but it was leading to the Zanarkand ruins;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;it was the border;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;I love X-2;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;!!!!!;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;it was the aftermath of Sin's destruction;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;So why Tidus?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 AM;he was a famous celebrity;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;strong memories in everyone's mind;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;Tidus was never a real person.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;"i'll always hate tidus as a person, though. he's relatively effective at what he does, but i just hate his dweeby-ass personality so much";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;that's why he was brough back as a pyrefly formation;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;because he was in the most people's memories;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;so...;;
Silver Haku#5279;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;"See, we all see it differently and that's why I love this game.";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:44 AM;"yeah, i've always seen tidus' celebrity status as the reason why he sort of persisted";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;there's a lot in the game's lore about memories binding you to the waking world;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;"Tidus was needed for X's plot. Someone not steeped in Yevon's 1,000 year dogma to childishly demand why? and persist when he didn't find an answer good enough.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;he's a literal memory given solid form;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;because of the will of the lost people of Zanarkand;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;pyreflies man;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;"trying to keep their desolated city, their dreams alive";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;after Sin wrought destruction on them;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:45 AM;"true, but one thing i didnt like is how only the dead people are the ones to actually challenge yevon";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;well no one living can challenge a god;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;because god is dead;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;B^);;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;"like, you know wakka's zealot ass be pulling a cain and abel on chappu if yevon asked him politely enough";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;"err *god, not a god";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;idk;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;Wakka kinda grew;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;"yeah, but only because people around him pushed him";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;he became less of a zealot;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:46 AM;at least tidus wa a bit of a free-thinker;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 AM;he even was okay with the hunters using machina to hunt sinspawn Gui;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 AM;and eventually stopped hating Al Bhed;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 AM;and even fought Yu;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 AM;so I guess you can say he grew a lot;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:47 AM;The way he stopped hating the Al Bhed was kind of weird.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:47 AM;but only because of a weird loophole. it took him a whole lot to challenge himself;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;It was way too fast and too sudden for someone who had such strong views and beliefs.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;"which is fine, but it's just odd that it had to take two ghosts (auron and tidus) to do it";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;yeahhh but that's final fantasy for ya;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;"and developmental limitations, prob";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;final fantasy is just a bunch of weird death dreams;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;Best ff stories imo;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:48 AM;"1. 6, 2. 10, 3. Tactics";;

Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:49 AM;Nah;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:49 AM;I’ve beaten RPGs i couldn’t stand;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:49 AM;Tactics is my #1;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:49 AM;I NEED A SEQUEL;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:49 AM;Like Suikoden IV or FF13;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;"Well, that's for me anyway. I won't play a game past a certain point if I really hate it.";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;solid list. i think it goes VI - Tactics - VIII;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;"I played Suikoden IV, I didn't think it was that bad";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;but probably anime boobs kept me playing it idk;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;"i'm pretty critical of almost everything, so don't attach emotion behind most of what i say hah";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;plot;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;Sometimes a game is so average that you keep playing to see when it gets good;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;I remember fighting a giant tree;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;as the last boss?;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;i did that with star ocean integrit and faithlessness;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;Yes;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;and it just kind of never happened;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:50 AM;"FF13 was terrible *for a Final Fantasy*, and mediocre for a jrpg in general. I didn't hate it.";;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;Same;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;agreed;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;i loved 13's battle system at the time;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;"yea, weird huh";;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;I like the battle system but that’s it;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;"i felt like it was actualy challenging, albeit it took you playing through 90% of the story to get to that point";;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;13 is easily the lowest point for the series for me;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;it's name;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;it's funny how people shit on 13's linearity when it's less linear than x;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;was literally fkcing;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;GIANT TREE;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 AM;AHAHAH WOW;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;my memory of the game is so accurate;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;"The battle system was interesting BUT I disliked how it gave you the feeling of freedom, but actually had a specific way it expected you to play.";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;"right, i can see that. ikind of like debuff, heal, attack kind of style";;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;especially during the Eidolon fights. Those were hell if you didn't know what to do.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;you mean like;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;"XIII-2 fixed some of that, but that game is the lowest point of the series to me";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;every Persona/SMT game ever?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;STACK DEBUFFS;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;PRAY THE ENEMY DOESNT HAVE DEKAJA DEKUNDA;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;FOCUS;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 AM;BIG ATTACK;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:53 AM;it resonated with me a bit because that's how i usually play JRPGs anyway;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:53 AM;You had to analyze the how the character was behaving that caused the Eidolon to show up and from that figure out what the battle wanted you to do.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:54 AM;13's story is like a shitty 90s dystopian action movie with anime gloss;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:54 AM;~~or use a guide but I don't like doing that on a first playthrough~~;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:54 AM;and it had pretty awful characters and dialogue;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:54 AM;i used a guide for gran pulse/sidequest stuff and treasure chests (i'm pretty blind) but that's it;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:54 AM;The characters were bland but not hate-able. They were too bland to be hated.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:55 AM;"true, except Snow";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:55 AM;fuck snow;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:55 AM;i really liked Sazh and Fang ruled too;;
Space Lion#9691;28-Apr-18 02:55 AM;@Carmine#9363 13 doesn’t have anything going for it like 10 and 10 is more non linear at the end of it;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:55 AM;I find it funny that Snow is a gender inversion of every love interest whose entire being focuses around her boyfriend.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:56 AM;"yeah, but inverting a gender role doesn't mean it's good or interesting";;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:56 AM;Oh not at all. It's still as annoying as when it's a girl.;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:56 AM;I just found it funny.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:56 AM;why you guys mentioning me in 13;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:56 AM;"word, same";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:56 AM;I didn't bring up 13;;

Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 02:58 AM;I am still not sure how to feel about 15 tbh;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:58 AM;"ooo it's on sale right now, too";;

Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 02:59 AM;nice!;;

Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:00 AM;i even like the MAJOR change of pace during the later chapters;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 03:00 AM;The story was fine besides for feeling... weirdly paced in a lot of places and like they cut out too much that should have been present.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:01 AM;i havent played since the first week it came out (plat'd it and then put it down) so i thought some things couldve used more fleshing out;;
Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 03:01 AM;The ending is nice. I actually like the ending.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:01 AM;heard it got better;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:01 AM;"use a veil before battle, debuff both legs, stagger one leg, break, stagger next leg, break, debuff head, stagger, get to 970% stagger, switch to com com com dps until 1.8mil hp left, use Highwind";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:01 AM;"i like the disjointed pace, but my major issue was the fucking uselessness of luna";;

Gae#5724;28-Apr-18 03:02 AM;Luna felt like she should have had a bigger part. She could have been a lot more interesting than she ended up being.;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:02 AM;her whole arc was so formulaic;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:31 AM;a perfect FFIX save file is so hard;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:31 AM;oh god i know;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:31 AM;it fucks with the anal-retentive perfectionist in me so hard;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;"there's so many missable synthesis items, you can screw your stats up by leveling up with the wrong gear";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;and marcus to level 99....;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;well;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;"if you do that, kiss the excalibur 2 goodbye";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;"yeah, that's true";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;wait wait;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;unless you use a booster;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:32 AM;you mean a gameshark >_>;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;then just hax in the excal 2 and the rest of the run will be easy;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;but i dont know if that would be legit;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;the only difficult thing about excal 2 run is the time constraint;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;not like;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;you're going to be arrested...;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;on ps4/steam it's not bad at all;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;lmao;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;there's no competitive FFIX circuit;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;I have a hacked FFIX file;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;99 of every item at the beginning of the game;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:33 AM;because I got sick of resetting excalibur 2 circuits;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;I got to...uhhh;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;Dali?;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;"with the speed option always on, you could do it with hours to spare";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;and I was 1 minute off target time;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;and it just got too hard;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;PSP there's no FMV skip;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;ah;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;which adds up time;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;"the game moves slower on PSP, which adds up time";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;"yeah, i can see that";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:34 AM;the fact that I was 1 minute off meant I was actually 1 minute ahead of my circuit;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:35 AM;which meant I was doing REALLY WELL;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:35 AM;but the PSP was just TOO SLOW;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:35 AM;tell it to grow up;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:35 AM;"can't you leave the game on for,  what";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:35 AM;2 years?;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:35 AM;or whatever it is;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:36 AM;lmao;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:36 AM;I think so;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:36 AM;not sure;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:37 AM;"man, i cant imagine leaving my PSX on for logner than, like, 6 hours";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:37 AM;that shit used to freeze so often;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:37 AM;it's like 3 years LOL;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 03:37 AM;I can't believe someone KNOWS that from experience;;

Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:38 AM;"HAH i mean, like";;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:38 AM;it had to have been datamined;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:38 AM;...right?;;
Joie#2226;28-Apr-18 03:40 AM;i remember reading about it in the shitty IX guide that basically told you to go to playonline.com for the most basic shit;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:00 AM;yea;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:00 AM;good luck landing it near pitoss;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:00 AM;How upgrade car to fly;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:00 AM;took me 6 tries man;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:00 AM;SIX TRIES;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;it's automatic;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;Like I've killed Ardyn so I assume I'm postgame :LUL:;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;ask Cindy to modify it;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;DID NOCTIS BECOME LESS OF A BITCH?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;OUT OF MY THRONE JESTER!;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;*rams several etheral swords up ass*;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;Yeah? But my issue is that he just kinda...stopped being a bitch.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;lmao;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;Like out of nowhere.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;that was your ONE complaint about him;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;it only took;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;Lunafreya dying;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;him dying;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;I'm like okay great you don't suck anymore;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:01 AM;his friends falling to ruin;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:02 AM;and being stuck in Angelgard for 10 years;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:02 AM;was it 10 years?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:02 AM;i don't remember;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:02 AM;Okay hang on I actually wanna talk about Angelgard;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;wow it was 10 years exactly my memory is better than i thought;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;anyways noctis has a 10 year respawn;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;he slept inside the crystal;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;The scene just ships him there but then makes out like he's got ten full years of downtime;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;he was asleep;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;it took him 10 years to commune with Bahamut;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;That's...kinda weak.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:03 AM;"in that time, Ardyn became a more successful villain than Kefka";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:04 AM;well he died;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:04 AM;it takes time to resurrect a king;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:04 AM;he literally melted into the crystal;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:04 AM;And that may very well be but my point is that the game doesn't do a great job of communicating that to me.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;It kinda assumes we're already on board.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;well;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;It's all very slapdash;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;kind of;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;it's mostly symbolism;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;i had a death dream once;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;after I got beat and tased by the police;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:05 AM;and then beat again and tased again while in custody;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:06 AM;and it was similar to melting into a crystal;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:06 AM;and I woke up in a jail cell too lmao;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:06 AM;and when I left my jail cell...;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:06 AM;MAN;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:06 AM;the world looked different;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:06 AM;all for shoplifting a $3 energy drink LOL;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;I got hit with two tasers;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;Ramuh smited me;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;my life might be FFXV;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;Homie what the fuck;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;right?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;I wish I was lying;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;my life parallelled FFXV for that period;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;I had a dream that I was strapped to a guillotine while I was unconscious;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;and they cut my head off;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;but it grew back;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:07 AM;and I woke up in this blue room;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;with a 6 inch thick door;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;this part wasn't the dream;;
Lukethekiddo#6436;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;was igor there?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;I don't know why they put me in a room like that;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;"no, but I could hear someone whispering through the door";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;that said can you hear me?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;and also I hear voices constantly now;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;Okay I'm  gonna  go back to xv now;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;get those car parts;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;do;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;PITOSS DUNGEON;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;it is;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:08 AM;amazing;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:09 AM;and horrifying;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:09 AM;I'm getting my airship first;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:09 AM;carship sir;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:09 AM;there's also a fucking off-roader;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 04:09 AM;but it eats gas so fast;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:53 AM;Okay let me level with you for a sec;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:53 AM;I don't know if I've ever had less fun in an airship;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:53 AM;This fuckin thing SUCKS;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:54 AM;I might be in the sky but it still tries to nail itself to roadways;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:54 AM;There's very little freedom so I can't go places that aren't already places I could get to by road;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Apr-18 04:54 AM;What is the actual point of this;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:14 AM;"no there's a few places you can get to, like Pitoss Ruins";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:14 AM;which are VERY lucrative to explore;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:15 AM;"it is honestly one of the coolest dungeons in Final Fantasy history, hands down the coolest actually";;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:17 AM;"That's like, your opinion man.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;have you actually played it though;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;it's incredible;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;it's creative;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;"it's out of place, a bit, but I mean damn";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;like...wow;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;they put so much work into it;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;and the pitoss speedruns are hilarious;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:19 AM;I can beat it in 5 minutes;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:20 AM;"some people spend 4 hours in there and get stuck, it's just fun";;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:23 AM;"I have, and no matter the environment, the combat system takes me right out of it.";;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:23 AM;"Eventually I'll complete XV, but not any time soon.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:32 AM;but Pitoss is like;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:32 AM;i dunno;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:32 AM;also the combat is fluid once you get used to it;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:32 AM;especially once you start link striking and combo linking;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:33 AM;and getting those blindsides and shit;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:33 AM;it looks so cinematic once you do things right;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:35 AM;"not that this is anything special, but just here Prompto made me love him even more";;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:35 AM;"My issue with the combat is that it is floaty.. No real force behind any of the strikes, except Gladio/two-handed swords";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:35 AM;and if you do all the stuff the battles look really cinematic;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:35 AM;well considering their weapons are ethereal;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:36 AM;imagine they're just hitting them with magic more or less;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:36 AM;I can fight a monster 10 levels below my characters and do exactly as much damage to them (visually) as to a monster 10 levels above me.;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;"All in all, feels like I'm less of a threat, and more of an annoyance";;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;There's no power fantasy in there at all;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;eh?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;there are monsters that kick my ass at Lv99;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;wait nvm;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;that's just in fucking Costlemark Menace dungeon;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:37 AM;and that's because item crutch is disabled;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:38 AM;That I'm less of a threat.. Me/You being the party.;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:38 AM;"Albeit that the game is easy enough, the party doesn't feel powerful.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:39 AM;D:;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:39 AM;"You did fight the moving mountain, did you not?";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:39 AM;Did that not make you feel powerful once you beat it? lol;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:42 AM;this is a meme to me;;

Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:43 AM;It is hard to compare action combat and turn-based-esque combat;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:44 AM;"In turn-based combat planning -> execution -> success, makes you feel powerful.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:46 AM;well in action combat execution in the way of spacing and action management make you feel powerful;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:46 AM;like I feel like a noob when I miss a giant flashing BLOCK prompt;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:46 AM;it happens;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:46 AM;but I feel powerful when I nail that window and get a riposte;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:47 AM;like nailing a parry riposte in Dark Souls;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:47 AM;"In action combat, increased speed of combat against common enemies, and visual feedback on attacks, makes you feel powerful.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:47 AM;*o*;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:49 AM;"For Dark Souls, part of the feeling of power, comes from repetition - you become able to predict the movements of the enemies/bosses, and thus able to respond in turn.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:50 AM;FFXVs feeling of power comes from playing a pinball minigame for 2 hours to get an Elemancy fusion material that allows you to craft Limit Break magic and one shot Red Giants;;
Malfred#1000;28-Apr-18 08:51 AM;I'm not even going to get into the magic system of XV.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:51 AM;it's weird but it's balanced because magic is so powerful;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:51 AM;"in the beginning of the game, you'll be smacking stuff for 200-400";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:51 AM;while your spells will be nuking things for 2000-4000;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 08:52 AM;"and it follows that curve for awhile until the damage caps, and then you can craft quint cast stuff that can sometimes nuke out 5 hits really fast...or just 1. Which is sadness";;

Sclipzer#0168;28-Apr-18 02:22 PM;That does sound possible;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:22 PM;the entire story;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:37 PM;and Cid had exerpts on it in his library;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:37 PM;even though NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN IT BEFORE;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:37 PM;oh wait it NEVER happens!;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:38 PM;Is any of this supposed to make necron more effective as a plot device or as a character?;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:38 PM;Necron isn't a character;;

Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:38 PM;I'm sorry your symbol didn't have character development and a lenghty introduction detailing its origins;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:38 PM;because literally no one in their universe had EVER SEEN IT;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:38 PM;What you don't understand is that just because it means something doesn't make it effective;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:38 PM;how WOULD YOU INTRODUCE IT?!;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;"there's literally no other way to do it, come on";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;story writing 101;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;Necron is a symbol of Kujas desire to bring an end to all life;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;None of what you are saying changes a thing. Everyone understands necron. The game explains enough about it;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;then why are you complaining LOL;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;Because it sucks;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;that is literally the opposite of what you complained about;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;why;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;you say it sucks;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:39 PM;give a reason;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;"Because it doesn't have any impact. Comes out of nowhere for the final fight and is then gone, it's not thought provoking or interesting. just a weird final boss";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;it's not thought provoking ?;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;???;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;No it's not;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;so you didn't ask what is this thing;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;No;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;of course you didn't;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:41 PM;because you knew everything about it;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;I just thought what a stupid final boss;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;because it had no introduction or development;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;Same reaction i had to like venom in spiderman 3 or whatever. Just a lame final enemy to pad it out.;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;okay so;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;you're saying;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;so many conflicting things that I can't continue this conversation;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:42 PM;I am saying necron sucked;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;The end;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;it came out of nowhere;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;Yup;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;"so it came out of nowhere, but you knew everything about it";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;it introduced itself well enough;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;"It comes out of nowhere, says a load of crap to explain its nature then you fight it";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;so fighting a symbol as a last boss is lame;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:43 PM;In this case yeah;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:44 PM;I mean it worked in 7 and 10 where the very last bosses weren't even bosses;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:44 PM;7's last boss was the antagonist;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:44 PM;10s last boss was the antagonist;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:45 PM;You didn't rly fight them;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 PM;9s 2nd to last boss was the antagonist;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:45 PM;They were impossible to lose;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:45 PM;"the last boss in 9 was a symbol of the antagonist refusing to die, and desiring to end all life";;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:45 PM;I get that is your interpretation of it;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;"if you wanna complain about stupid last bosses, how about Ultimecia and time compression";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;that's a very close to real interpretation;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;it also makes sense because it follows the plot;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;and ties everything up;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;"Memoria, the Lifa Tree, Gaia";;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;"Why do people even complain about the Sephrioth fight, it's literally a cutscene following the actual final boss you just faced.";;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:46 PM;the Lifa Tree linking the two;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;I don't think it ties anything up;;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;It's an *Interactive cutscene*;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;"Kuja used a massive amount of energy to link Memoria (where the Crystal was, which is the key to all life on Gaia) so he could destroy the crystal and end all life on Gaia";;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;@Socindwich#0753 agreed and i believe it wasn't meant to be a literal fight but rather cloud mentally destroying sephiroth;;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;Safer is the real final boss;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;did you know;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:47 PM;if you don't Omnislash;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;you just counter attack;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;it's so lame;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;and even if you only do 1 damage;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;he dies;;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;So?;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;Yeah because it isn't a physical fight;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:48 PM;It was cloud in his own head ridding himself of sephiroth;;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:49 PM;smh;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:49 PM;You are talking about symbolism a lot  @Carmine#9363 yet you don't seem to understand the most obvious example of symbolism in the entire series;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:49 PM;um;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:49 PM;you have no evidence of that;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:49 PM;you're making an assumption out of thin air;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:49 PM;lol;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;Nah it is a pretty widely accepted thing;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;I don't think you have any idea what you're talking about;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;The last physical fight with sephiroth was safer sephiroth;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;okay I'm not arguing with you;;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;Why do you even need evidence for an actual scene that plays out in the game;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;You can think what you want about me;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;no;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:50 PM;I'm talking about his attack on me lol;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;ou are talking about symbolism a lot  @Carmine#9363 yet you don't seem to understand the most obvious example of symbolism in the entire series;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;he has no evidence of that;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;I've never met you;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;you've never talked to me before this;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;Interesting  @Carmine#9363;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;you're making an assumption about me out of thin air;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;I know I am;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;so;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;that makes you a dumbass;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;I see;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;you realize that making an assumption about someone;;
Socindwich#0753;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;????????????;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;based on no evidence;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:51 PM;makes you a complete moron;;
Carmine#9363;28-Apr-18 02:52 PM;That would be like me assuming you can't change a tire;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:52 PM;So what you were doing to me earlier makes you a complete moron? Got it;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:52 PM;Glad we cleared that up;;
action warrior#8892;28-Apr-18 02:52 PM;Let's move on;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:07 AM;"The FNC universe has four (five?) gods; Pulse, Etro, Lindzei, Bhunivelze. (Mwynn?)";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:08 AM;"Take care not to confuse Pulse with Gran Pulse. The game will use Pulse and Gran Pulse interchangeably when referring to the planet below. Pulse is also the name of a God, so be aware of that.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:09 AM;"Gran Pulse is largely Pulse's creation (natch), while Cocoon was the work of Lindzei.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:10 AM;Each of those gods then made their own Fal'Cie for their own worlds.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:10 AM;This is the reason for the game using the terms Pulse Fal'Cie and Cocoon Fal'Cie.;;
NapoLeon S78#5523;29-Apr-18 03:10 AM;ohh there are 2 fal'cie;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:11 AM;"For Example, Phoenix, who lights up the sky in Cocoon, is a Cocoon Fal'Cie. Atomos, who carves paths into the tunnels on the lowerworld, is a Pulse Fal'Cie.";;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:20 AM;"Okay, back to your first question; yes this plot point was revealed before the Cid Raines fight, so I'll explain it simply here.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:23 AM;"Barthandelus' ultimate goal has been to fill Cocoon with humans, and once he is satisfied with the population, he wants to destroy Cocoon, killing everyone inside., , The reason for this is; when a person dies, their soul returns to the Chaos through Etro's Gate. A single death will only open the Gate a small amount, but if a massive loss of life, tens or hundreds of millions, were to occur all at once, Etro's Gate would be thrown open to awake the Gods. Barthandelus hopes the Gods will then imbue the Fal'Cie with free will, that they might remake the world in their image.";;
NapoLeon S78#5523;29-Apr-18 03:27 AM;ohh i see;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:39 AM;Just stop with the unnecessary spoilers. Just because you're in the spoilers room doesn't mean it's fair game to just ruin shit for everyone who hasn't finished the game yet.;;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 03:41 AM;But why should I assume that it ruin shit for everyone who hasn't finished the game yet?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:41 AM;@Mods Can you arbitrate this one for me please.;;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 03:42 AM;Or perhaps a better way of wording it would be: Why should I assume that someone who thinks spoilers would ruin their experience of any piece of media - would visit a channel called spoilers?;;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 03:42 AM;"I realise that this one isn't game specific, and not everyone has played every Final Fantasy game out there - but still.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:43 AM;You know damn well why that person is here and I will not be dragged down to that level.;;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 03:45 AM;"They asked questions the answers to which contain minor spoilers for the story of XIII, but when you mentioned such they didn't seem to change their mind about getting into it.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;29-Apr-18 03:46 AM;I will not sit here and be trolled by you. I'll wait for the mods to wake up and they can handle this.;;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 03:47 AM;Trolled?;;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 03:48 AM;Now you're the one trying to drag me down.;;
NapoLeon S78#5523;29-Apr-18 03:57 AM;thank you for the all information;;

Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 05:13 AM;"Just madmen in general, probably.";;
Joie#2226;29-Apr-18 05:29 AM;"for a completely useless reward, too. it just holds a button down for you";;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 06:39 AM;5 hours is about average for a first run. Now watch a speedrunner do it in 5 minutes lmao;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 07:03 AM;the real reward are all the oracle coins that you can turn into delicious ribbons;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 09:50 AM;"Ah, good morning";;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 09:52 AM;good morning;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 09:52 AM;I guess you waking up is a spoiler;;

Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 09:53 AM;Beep boop?;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 09:54 AM;blip beeeee bleep beep boooop bo bo blim;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 09:55 AM;Why do late night arguments only happen on days where I don't do allnighters?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 09:56 AM;I guess we really need a mod from UTC 8;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:06 AM;we aren't allowed to argue?;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:07 AM;"and a mod was on, they just didn't care";;
Malfred#1000;29-Apr-18 10:13 AM;I would certainly have been surprised if they were.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 10:14 AM;Some mods are here just so they have a platform to discuss the FF subreddit;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 10:15 AM;Not all of them are committed to moderating the community;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:16 AM;whats the point in having a community if you prevent debate?;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:16 AM;that's borderline thought policing;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:17 AM;one should be able to disagree with a popular opinion freely;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 10:17 AM;Are you saying that you don't want us to stop any arguments?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 10:18 AM;"You're allowed to freely disagree with one another, not insult each other over who you think is right";;
Thelitedragon#4507;29-Apr-18 10:18 AM;There's a difference between an argument and a disagreement;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:19 AM;oh;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:20 AM;"yea well I was disagreeing and stating a point, the other guy was just saying you're wrong without actually providing a point and then proceeded to say you don't know how to analyze a plot device";;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:20 AM;he was just complaining about something he thought was lame without even saying why;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:21 AM;and making an assumption about someone who you've never met/talked to before makes you kind of a dumbass;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 10:35 AM;I finally fucking did it;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 10:35 AM;I beat li-grim;;

Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:40 AM;oh right;;
Carmine#9363;29-Apr-18 10:40 AM;Remedi is the last boss of A1;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 10:40 AM;Lols... Li Grim wasn't really that hard;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 10:41 AM;But perhaps you were unlucky?;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 10:41 AM;Going to do the quests only available after beating her?;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 10:50 AM;Yep;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 10:50 AM;Including that gay bride one;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 11:19 AM;Lols.... It's fun;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 11:20 AM;Did you start A2 yet or want any help with that....?;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 11:20 AM;"It should be fairly easy, to start with, at least....";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 11:24 AM;I didn't start yet;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 11:27 AM;"OK, how many of the FFTA quests you got left?";;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 11:28 AM;Can't remember exactly how many are only after the final boss.... But 1 requires you to have done every other quest;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 11:31 AM;Let's see;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-Apr-18 11:31 AM;About 126;;
Bruce#0080;29-Apr-18 11:32 AM;"Oh, quite a few left, then.... That was probably part of your difficulty with li grim";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;30-Apr-18 01:49 PM;When I said I beat li-grim;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;30-Apr-18 01:49 PM;"I lied, I'm in denial";;
Bruce#0080;30-Apr-18 02:04 PM;Uh huh.... I'd recommend doing as many quests as possible before that;;
Bruce#0080;30-Apr-18 02:09 PM;"IIRC, there's 300 in total & only about 10 that you have to be in New game + to do....";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;30-Apr-18 02:16 PM;Why am I in denial;;
Bruce#0080;30-Apr-18 03:20 PM;Dunno?;;

Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:08 PM;x-2.5 is the novel where tidus and yuna go to and island and tidus gets blown up by a bomb after a fight;;
Joie#2226;01-May-18 09:09 PM;oh yeah lmao;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:09 PM;and --will-- was that bullshit audio drama;;
Joie#2226;01-May-18 09:09 PM;that one is such fucking trash;;
Joie#2226;01-May-18 09:09 PM;the audio drama is really bad too;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:09 PM;where sin comes back and yuna loves someone else;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:09 PM;i despise those both and wish i never seen them;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:09 PM;im fine with just loving x;;
Diabetus#1452;01-May-18 09:09 PM;how many x spin offs are there?;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:09 PM;4;;
Joie#2226;01-May-18 09:09 PM;"counting X-2, there's 4";;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:09 PM;but i mean;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:10 PM;at least x-2 is serviceable at best;;
Joie#2226;01-May-18 09:10 PM;"agreed. at least it's an actual game you can play, too";;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:10 PM;i'm fine with that existing and i dont really consider it cannon;;
Silver Haku#5279;01-May-18 09:10 PM;but the other two shouldn't exist;;
Joie#2226;01-May-18 09:11 PM;that's my head-canon too;;
Zenkure#1365;02-May-18 05:47 PM;The only good headcanon is the one where X-2 is all that matters;;
Zenkure#1365;02-May-18 05:47 PM;X is serviceable at best;;
Zenkure#1365;02-May-18 05:47 PM;:HAHAHAHAHA:;;
Silver Haku#5279;02-May-18 05:54 PM;The only true head cannon is crystal defenders;;
Joie#2226;02-May-18 11:04 PM;lmao i played so much crystal defenders;;
Joie#2226;02-May-18 11:05 PM;"not proud of it, damnit";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:21 PM;Alma being the vessel for altima;;

Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:22 PM;well what's weird is in the final fight she's a separate entity;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:22 PM;Altima or Ultima;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:22 PM;Altima;;

Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:22 PM;"i like altima personally, but what can ya do";;

Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:24 PM;"like, remember this is a time before soap";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:24 PM;Was St Ajora originally a guy or a woman;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:24 PM;and that demon taint is pretty wily;;

Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:24 PM;they bathe and stuff;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:24 PM;there's even lipstick and makeup in FFT;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:24 PM;and perfume;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:25 PM;why would they not have soap you dingus;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:25 PM;lipstick and make-up doesn't stop the clap;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:25 PM;O;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:25 PM;Well I mean;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:25 PM;He DID use Alma's body;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:25 PM;ahaha i guess i mean more modern soap;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:25 PM;So technically;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:25 PM;Uhhh nah;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:25 PM;I mean;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:27 PM;"did yall ever play any of the Ogre Battle games, by the way?";;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:27 PM;it's not like they're all stuck on pirate ships with no running water;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:27 PM;Nope;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:27 PM;I played Ogre Battle 64;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:27 PM;Nope;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:27 PM;Tactics Ogre Knight of Lodis;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:27 PM;Let Us Cling Together;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:27 PM;and that's it;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:27 PM;they're all so fucking good;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:27 PM;I named Dio Dickhead;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:28 PM;Why;;
Bruce#0080;04-May-18 01:28 PM;"Yep, I played Tactics Ogre KoL....";;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:28 PM;self description;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:28 PM;but the TO games are basically like FFT carbon-copies--for better or worse;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:28 PM;i think ogre battle 64 is my favorite tactics-style game ever. i loved the class system in that;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 01:29 PM;I haven't played any of them;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:29 PM;really recommend it;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:29 PM;I liked how they fought as a unit;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:30 PM;even march of the black queen for SNES is hot fire;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:30 PM;but independently;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:30 PM;like you couldn't give them exact commands;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:30 PM;you just put a party together and hoped they synergized;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:30 PM;"yeah, there's definitely that random element that's hit-or-miss";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:30 PM;but it's part of how the game plays;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:31 PM;"the AI improves as you level up and advance in class, which i think is pretty interesting";;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:33 PM;only thing I thought was kinda weird was;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:33 PM;alignment grinding but meh;;
Carmine#9363;04-May-18 01:33 PM;like you needed certain alignment to use certain equipment or get certain characters or have certain units in your squad;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:34 PM;"yeah, it was definitely weird";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:34 PM;but also pretty unique;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:35 PM;"i liked how dragoons could only be chaotic, priness as lawful, etc.";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 01:35 PM;it made it so you could have a bunch of varied parties;;
Silver Haku#5279;04-May-18 02:17 PM;Should I get cloud back from Sephiroth before I do side quests?;;
Silver Haku#5279;04-May-18 02:17 PM;I just got the airship;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:22 PM;Get Cloud back asap;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:22 PM;He's one of the only 2 good characters;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:26 PM;"i usually do, yeah. and get omnislash as fast as you can";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:27 PM;I really connect with Shadow;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:27 PM;@Space Lion#9691 i like how Shadow essentially forfeited all of his emotions because he didnt want to accept responsibility;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:27 PM;He's a man who can't forgive himself;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:28 PM;"for his past crimes, for not killing his friend to save him the misery of being tortured";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:28 PM;"he didnt want to raise a kid, he didn't want to be held accountable for being an assassin or taking bad assignments, etc";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:28 PM;he's a guy who thinks everything he touches turns to ash;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:28 PM;I like how that plot point is forgotten completely in the Wor though;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:28 PM;which it kind of does haha;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:28 PM;and when his wife died during childbirth he has an other reason to partially blame himself;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:28 PM;I find him so relatable and realistic;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:29 PM;"and when he does see Relm and the life he could have had, he doesn't get misty-eyed about it; he just does what he needs to be done and stays detached";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;"and in the end, he still never forgives himself";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;but he manages to stop running;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;and dies in kefka's tower;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:29 PM;yupppp;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;what a character;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:29 PM;"fuck, that scene with him telling interceptor to go away";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:29 PM;DESTROYS me;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;the flashback or in the ending;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:29 PM;in the ending;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;and then his MUSIC;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:29 PM;in the ending;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:30 PM;and it's triumphant;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:30 PM;but really he's just staying there to die;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:30 PM;ughhh it gets me so good;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:30 PM;that whole ending theme is insane;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:30 PM;to do that on the SNES soundtrack;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:30 PM;@Socindwich#0753 what is forgotten?;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:30 PM;with so many key and tempo changes and also stay consistent with the scene itself;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:31 PM;imo shadow was fine raising a kid;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:31 PM;i think the shadow stuff is stil very apparent in WoR;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:31 PM;the problem is that he blames himself for everything;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:31 PM;"right, and he didnt want to be reminded of that";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:31 PM;and he thinks he'll burn her too;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:31 PM;my interpretation of shadow is a man who cannot see anything he does as good;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:31 PM;so he fights so he can die;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:32 PM;but he can't recognize that he has brought innocence into the world too;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:32 PM;and the direction of his dreams is HAUNTING.;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:32 PM;for a Super Nintendo rpg;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:32 PM;"the music, the sound effects";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:33 PM;that SCREECHING noise;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:33 PM;"clyyyyde, how dare you?!";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:33 PM;holy shit;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:33 PM;oh totally. his nightmares gave ME nightmares;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:33 PM;they did?;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:33 PM;"as a kid, yeah";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:34 PM;"i played FFVI when it first came out, so i tihnk i was like...6?";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:34 PM;scary;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:34 PM;"oh wow, 5 actually";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:36 PM;i feel like the 90s just did dream sequences really well haha;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:36 PM;Shadows story;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:36 PM;or maybe it's just that the trope didn't get as tired;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:37 PM;Shadow's story definitely could use more work in WoR;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:37 PM;But I think it works as intended;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:37 PM;"yeah, i think the whole game could have used more story in WoR";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:37 PM;agreed;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:37 PM;but it works out;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:37 PM;WoR feels so...detached;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:37 PM;IDK;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:37 PM;and i think that's almost the point;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:37 PM;yeah;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:38 PM;form follow function really well in it as well;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:38 PM;I feel like it has the right amount and also for selfish reasons could use a little more haha;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:38 PM;haha same here;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:38 PM;LIke how did Strago become entwined with the Fanatics;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:38 PM;yeah! that plot point seems so glossed over;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:38 PM;"i mean, he kind of just fell into despair and thought relm was dead, right?";;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:39 PM;That's all she wrote;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:39 PM;"one thing i've always found interesting in WoR is how there's what, 1 returner npc? and no one even talks about or mentions banon";;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:39 PM;Relm is so much better than Strago however;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:40 PM;Probably because he's dead probably;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:40 PM;maybe;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:40 PM;?;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:40 PM;what do you mean;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:40 PM;Probably not actually;;
Socindwich#0753;04-May-18 02:40 PM;idfk;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:40 PM;"and the concept of the empire is really interesting in WoR because it's crazy to think about how so many people felt secure and safe in the empire, but then it's destroyed from within and all of that safety and security is thrown otu the window with kefka's whole i can roast ya azz at any time schtick";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:41 PM;I think it's strongly hinted that Banon and Arvis or whatever dies;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:41 PM;during thamasa;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:41 PM;"remember, there was a peace";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:41 PM;but when you go to the empire after that it's totally vacant;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:41 PM;"oh yeah, that's what i've always assumed";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:41 PM;i figured they were murdered;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:41 PM;"i really like how the game dosn't overtly say it, though";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:41 PM;leads you to put the pieces together yourself;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:41 PM;but after WoR it makes sense no one would mention banon;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:42 PM;"it's like, who tf is that guy at that piont?";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:42 PM;when you've got demons running around and kefka destroying towns;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:42 PM;haha yup;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:42 PM;they do mention that both the returners and the empire are gone though;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:43 PM;i like the idea of the figureheads of both sides (gestahl of the empire and banonthe returners) dying;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:44 PM;i think it's hinted both factions died;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:44 PM;and in the wake came kefka;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:44 PM;"i just replayed VI too, and one thing i noticed is how the game doesnt truly paint the returners as the good guys as much as i thought it did";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:44 PM;i really like how in VI you can piece together things without the game shoving stuff in your face;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:44 PM;it really treats the player with respect;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:44 PM;"yupp, something that's kind of lost in modern gaming";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:45 PM;even games like VII and up;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:45 PM;XV's ending kind of did too;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:45 PM;although VIII has flirting with stuff like that;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:45 PM;which is why i like it haha;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:45 PM;same;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:46 PM;From Kotaku article on FFVI;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:46 PM;Chrono Trigger kind of does that too;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:46 PM;xenosaga also;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:46 PM;funny how those are some of the best games from that era;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:47 PM;"That’s not what’s remarkable about Final Fantasy VI, though. What’s remarkable are moments like this:, , https://youtu.be/uvxoIcgdpio, , This scene—which is optional and only triggered when you put the brothers Edgar and Sabin in your party and bring them to Figaro Castle—reveals the tragic backstory of two characters who have, until now, seemed sort of like jokes. Sabin is a feeble-minded musclehead; Edgar is a lecherous engineer.";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:47 PM;"As you learn in the flashback, however, they’ve been through some shit. Their father died a decade before the events of Final Fantasy VI, and in his dying wishes, he asked both Figaro brothers to rule over the country in his stead. But neither Sabin nor Edgar want to be king. Sabin tries to talk Edgar into abandoning Figaro, but Edgar points out how cowardly that would be. Their father, whose shadow looms large over both of them, would be disappointed if they fled the country. So Edgar makes a proposition., , “Let’s settle this with the toss of a coin,” Edgar says (according to the Game Boy Advance translation, which trumps the garbled SNES version). “If it’s heads, you win. Tails, I win. The winner chooses whatever path he wants… no regrets, no hard feelings.”, , Sabin agrees, and then the camera follows the coin up in the air for a few seconds before fading to black. We know what happens, of course. Edgar rules Figaro for nearly ten years. Sabin, meanwhile, spends the next decade training to be a martial artist. In the present, they share a few sweet words, take a drink, and then carry on with the adventure., , A little later, this happens:, , In an attempt to convince the wandering gambler Setzer to help their crew fight the Empire, Edgar pulls out the coin once again, proposing that if he flips heads, Setzer joins them. The coin lands on heads, Edgar wins, and Setzer immediately notices that it was a trick. Edgar is using a double-headed coin. Outside of a quick throwaway line that you’ll only see if Sabin is in the party (“That coin…”), Final Fantasy VI lets you put the pieces together yourself: Edgar let his brother win that life-altering bet all those years ago. Edgar, a character who until now was best summed up as a horny creep, intentionally threw away his entire life for Sabin. And Sabin never knew.";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:47 PM;Edgar ❤;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:47 PM;"yesss, i love that scene";;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:48 PM;"i wish edgar and sabin had a bit more to their stories, too";;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:48 PM;same;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:48 PM;but what's there works;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:48 PM;sabin gets it better than edgar i think;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:49 PM;story-wise;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:49 PM;definitely;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:49 PM;this is why i'll always advocate a VI remake: so we could have just a bit more backstory;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:51 PM;VI NEEDS a remake;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:51 PM;YES;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:51 PM;WAY MORE than VII;;
Space Lion#9691;04-May-18 02:51 PM;it DESERVES it!;;
Nieran#1297;04-May-18 02:51 PM;... which one is 6 again?;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:51 PM;6;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:52 PM;Is 6;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:52 PM;The one before VII;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:52 PM;And the one after V;;
Nieran#1297;04-May-18 02:52 PM;Can I get an answer from someone OTHER than the Jojo-high elitist?;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:52 PM;"agreed! but if VI's battle system as much as VII's is apparently being changed, i'd be furious";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:52 PM;Uhh;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:52 PM;I gave you the answer;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:53 PM;That anyone else would've gave you;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:53 PM;Why would anyone want the same answer from a different person;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:53 PM;There's no logic in that;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:53 PM;Smh;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:53 PM;VI was the one released as Final Fantasy III for the SNES in NA/EUI;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:54 PM;That too;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:54 PM;But that 3 = 6 stuff is done now;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:54 PM;i assume that's what he was asking;;
Nieran#1297;04-May-18 02:55 PM;"Sorry, I identify games by their main villain";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:55 PM;Either that or he knows nothing;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:55 PM;Lol;;
Joie#2226;04-May-18 02:55 PM;"i figured like 99.9% of the people who would like FF enough to join a discord would know that, but alas";;
Nieran#1297;04-May-18 02:55 PM;Sadly the only real FF I played was 10;;
Nieran#1297;04-May-18 02:55 PM;or the only one I owned and got the CHANCE to play.;;
Nieran#1297;04-May-18 02:56 PM;and only did extensive research on most others.;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-May-18 02:56 PM;Prolly the latter;;

Joie#2226;11-May-18 11:08 PM;"Yeah, remastered character sprites are pretty stinky";;
Joie#2226;11-May-18 11:09 PM;I love how kefka just tosses around the espers like it Ain't no thing. Always wondered which espers the ones who get smoked are;;
assholemon#0823;11-May-18 11:14 PM;ifriti and shiva;;
assholemon#0823;11-May-18 11:14 PM;I recall it because it happened 2 days ago when i played it;;
assholemon#0823;11-May-18 11:15 PM;And they won't do the chrono trigger thing on steam due to not having enough pressure;;
assholemon#0823;11-May-18 11:15 PM;"I mean, the collective effort of downrating chrono trigger on steam had them to listen hard and do something";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 12:07 AM;"Yeah, that was dope. I streamed a playthrough of it when it dropped on steam and crticiized the fuck out of it. Wish I would've waited a few weeks";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;13-May-18 01:19 PM;Yeah it’s Ifrit and Shiva. I just played through that part a couple days ago too.;;

Joie#2226;14-May-18 03:49 PM;"i still prefer kefka because he's more iconic to me. and also love how he's a villain without motive, agent of chaos a la TDK Joker, etc etc.";;
Joie#2226;14-May-18 03:50 PM;"also, nothing is scarier than an impossibly strong man wearing a fedora. he literally m'lady-d the world to death";;
Carmine#9363;14-May-18 04:52 PM;he has a motive though;;
Carmine#9363;14-May-18 04:53 PM;"he wanted to control the empire, and when that failed because Ghestal decided to turn on him, he just used espers to ruin the world of balance";;
Carmine#9363;14-May-18 04:53 PM;Ardyn was written better in my opinion because he was somewhat sympathetic;;
pokemongenius#1474;14-May-18 04:55 PM;Kefka is also weirdly lovable because of just how crazy he is. His dialogue is top notch;;
Joie#2226;14-May-18 05:07 PM;"yeah, that's true. i guess i should have said sympathetic, because apart from kefka being driven insane by magitek experimentation, there isn't a whole lot";;

Illixir#6703;22-May-18 04:19 PM;If the aeons were there before The Fayth how come they disappeared after The Fayth stopped dreaming?;;
pokemongenius#1474;22-May-18 04:29 PM;Magic 👀;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 05:16 PM;I have a theory.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 05:17 PM;What if I told you that Sephiroth intentionally loses all his fights to Cloud?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;22-May-18 06:16 PM;"Out with it, then";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:21 PM;"So when Sephiroth was defeated the first time, it was noted that Sephiroth survived within the lifestream.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:21 PM;Or not necessarily the first time but first time as in before the events in Advent Children.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:21 PM;Because technically he was beat multiple times.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:22 PM;So he goes into the lifestream and apparently part of why he survived was through his hatred for Cloud.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:23 PM;"It doesn't go into detail as to *why* his hatred for Cloud allows him to sustain himself within the lifestream, but it does, and then as we know, the way he becomes fully resurrected are through those vessels ( like Kadaj for instance ).";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:23 PM;"Anyway, the reason this is important is because Sephiroth also has a god complex.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:26 PM;"As Sephiroth described to Cloud, his goal is to sail the cosmos with this planet ( Gaia ) as his vessel, just as his Mother did long ago.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:27 PM;"At any rate, part of being a God is obviously being immortal, which means either never being able to die or being able to easily just come right back after you do die.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:27 PM;"So this is the first part of the theory. Just establishing Sephiroth's character a bit, and how he's able to come back after being killed.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:28 PM;"The second part of the theory is that Sephiroth is the strongest character in the FF7 universe, according to the people who created it.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:30 PM;"Cloud should never actually be able to kill Sephiroth. And even when you observe their battle in Advent Children, Sephiroth maintains a calm demeanor throughout the entirety of it and never really seems too worried. He shows a slight bit of surprise at the end when Cloud finally uses his strongest attack, but that's about it, at the end of which Sephiroth confidently states I'll never be a memory - hinting at the fact that he's just going to eventually reappear.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:31 PM;"Also, take note of the fact that nearing the end of their battle, Sephiroth asks Cloud to tell him what he cherishes the most.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:32 PM;"This is SUPER important, as it shows that Sephiroth wants to defeat Cloud MENTALLY. Taking away what he cherishes most would give Cloud a reason to stop fighting.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:32 PM;Without him actually having to physically destroy Cloud.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:33 PM;"Ok, so now we put all this information together.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:33 PM;"My theory is that because Sephiroth, to some extent, relies upon Cloud for his immortality, Sephiroth doesn't actually want to kill Cloud.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:34 PM;"Instead, he'd just like for Cloud to exist, but to stop getting in his way.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:34 PM;"Which would explain why despite being more powerful than Cloud, Cloud is able to keep winning against him.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:35 PM;There is also a cutscene in Dissidia which has something interesting.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:36 PM;;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/448630209395294218/26167462_10212684481559312_3707248267672018424_n.png;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:36 PM;"This is Sephiroth speaking iirc. Again, it's hinting at the fact that Sephiroth can keep coming back because of Cloud.";;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:37 PM;So he's stuck in this interesting situation where the one person who poses any real threat to him is also the person that he needs to stay alive.;;
Neo, Dodger of Bullets#2621;22-May-18 06:38 PM;"And he'll always keep losing because he's forced to hold back in every fight against Cloud, otherwise he could destroy him.";;
Illixir#6703;22-May-18 06:43 PM;Cloud is just a puppet to Sephiroth. Nothing more nothing less. Atleast at first;;

Illixir#6703;26-May-18 03:42 AM;:/;;
Illixir#6703;26-May-18 03:44 AM;Ah i found out;;
Illixir#6703;26-May-18 03:45 AM;His mother became the final summon for seymour;;
Illixir#6703;26-May-18 03:45 AM;Yunalesca made her a fayth for the final summoning;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;26-May-18 03:46 AM;"but for  that to happen, the chosen person needs to be of some importance to the summoner";;
Illixir#6703;26-May-18 03:47 AM;Yeah...its his mother;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;26-May-18 03:47 AM;hence power of love;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;26-May-18 12:23 PM;Does daggers name ever change back to garnet;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:24 PM;nope;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:24 PM;but when she finds out about her past they refer to her as garnet once more;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:24 PM;i think Brahne does right before she dies;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;26-May-18 12:24 PM;Umm im on disc 3 so yeah;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;26-May-18 12:25 PM;Brahne already dead;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:25 PM;"yeah, i think that's the only time";;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;26-May-18 12:25 PM;What was your team when u played;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:27 PM;i used everyone pretty equally;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:27 PM;but Eiko was definitely my MVP;;
Joie#2226;26-May-18 12:28 PM;then probably Quina. i did the marcus glitch and also got 101 frogs super early;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;26-May-18 12:28 PM;I gtg ill stalk to ya later;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;26-May-18 12:28 PM;Talk lol;;

Doctor_Vile#6548;26-May-18 11:54 PM;>watching an audio drama;;
Yukito#2049;27-May-18 05:36 PM;">Ah i found out, His mother became the final summon for seymour, , I believe it's the same for the Magus Sisters, too. Not sure why THREE fayths were made for that one, though";;
Yukito#2049;27-May-18 05:37 PM;"Though it's odd that summoning Anima doesn't kill the summoner, so I guess they only die when Yu Yevon possesses the Aeon?";;
Yukito#2049;27-May-18 05:38 PM;I wonder if a summoner that beat Sin has ever stuck around as an unsent to see if Sin stays dead?;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-May-18 11:12 PM;Time to listen;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-May-18 11:12 PM;To two audio drama videos;;

assholemon#0823;28-May-18 08:12 AM;So I'm now going to tackle the temple of the ancients;;
assholemon#0823;28-May-18 08:13 AM;In ff7;;
assholemon#0823;28-May-18 08:13 AM;I already have aeris to a 38 iirc and have a date with her in the gold saucer;;
assholemon#0823;28-May-18 08:14 AM;My only question is;;
assholemon#0823;28-May-18 08:15 AM;Does that famous scene occurs at the end of disc 1 (where I'm going right now) or in disc 2 (which will take a while)?;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:23 AM;idr but DON'T FORGET TO GRAB THE RIBBON FROM TEMPLE OF THE ANCIENTS;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:23 AM;that is especially important if you want to get Omnislash on Disk 1;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 10:54 AM;A shame I never did that in my run of 7;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:54 AM;early ribbon brek the gaem;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 10:54 AM;I feel bad now cause I never got to using Omnislash;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 10:54 AM;Idk about the ribbon;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 10:54 AM;I got it but I never equipped it;;

Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:56 AM;or do you just equip stuff with COOL NAMES;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 10:56 AM;I equip stuff with the most slots for Materia;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 10:56 AM;Cause I'm a loser;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 10:56 AM;ACCESSORIES;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:00 AM;But;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:00 AM;I'm sorry fictional characters;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:00 AM;there;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:00 AM;I remember uh;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:01 AM;Clouds health was over 2000 at the northern crater;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:01 AM;i would HOPE so;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:02 AM;Do you know how low that is;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:02 AM;It could've been over 6k;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:02 AM;Or 8;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:02 AM;But nah;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:02 AM;At disc 3 it was at 2k;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:02 AM;The final part of the game;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:03 AM;<_<;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:04 AM;I had random encounters off;;

Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:07 AM;idk you have to answer that question yourself;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:07 AM;if you were able to beat the game then I guess not;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:07 AM;then again the final boss scales with your level so;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:09 AM;I mean;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:09 AM;I did beat him;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:10 AM;Just barely;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:14 AM;I'm sad;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:16 AM;y u sad;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:17 AM;Cause i barely beat the game;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:19 AM;yea but you beat it at least;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:19 AM;im guessing you didn't beat the weapons though;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:20 AM;You're right I didn't lol;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:24 AM;Just diamond;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:55 AM;that doesn't count because it's part of the plot >_>;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:55 AM;and that thing can be beaten with a lv10 cloud;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:56 AM;Let me live my life;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:56 AM;Knowing that I beat a WEAPON;;

Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:58 AM;yea no beating diamond literally doesn't count;;
Carmine#9363;28-May-18 11:58 AM;you didn't even beat Ultima Weapon;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;28-May-18 11:59 AM;Diamond weapon;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;29-May-18 11:56 PM;Where's the blood;;
assholemon#0823;29-May-18 11:59 PM;i dunno;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;30-May-18 12:03 AM;That's MEEEEEEEN;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;30-May-18 12:03 AM;Maybe Square didn't have experience with FMV effects back then;;
assholemon#0823;30-May-18 12:05 AM;"the only thing about the aerith scene is that it's pretty much ruined by it being the most well know spoiler, it is a very sad scene, where cloud loses one of him most significant friends and potential GF, but because it's meme status";;
assholemon#0823;30-May-18 12:05 AM;"I mean, i was expecting it instead of being shocked";;
assholemon#0823;30-May-18 12:15 AM;and thus disc 1 is completed;;
assholemon#0823;30-May-18 12:15 AM;people are telling me that the rest of the discs don't take that long;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;30-May-18 01:57 AM;Disc 2 takes a while;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;30-May-18 01:57 AM;Disc 3 is short;;
Carmine#9363;30-May-18 05:03 AM;there's no blood because back then it would have bumped it up to an M rating;;
Carmine#9363;30-May-18 05:03 AM;"which would have excluded a lot of us from playing it back in 1997, myself in cluded";;

Carmine#9363;30-May-18 01:15 PM;Well long story short I was a latchkey kid;;
Carmine#9363;30-May-18 01:15 PM;I played Resident Evil when it was released;;

Joie#2226;30-May-18 03:14 PM;we're probably around the same age. i got resident evil within a few months of release and i think i was 8 or so;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:26 AM;Necron is Kuja's will to destroy all living things;;

Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:27 AM;"which begins the destruction of Memoria and wakes up Necron, barely leaving the party alive to confront this new entity";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:28 AM;"Necron is the physical embodiement of all of Kuja's desires to end all life, because of his selfishness. He was cursed with a short life as a genome and as such was jealous of all normal living things that could live long meaningful lives";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:28 AM;"So as his final act of jealousy, he blew up the crystal that linked Memoria to the Lifa tree";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:29 AM;@Marcello#4574;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:30 AM;sorry Necron wasn't given character development;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-May-18 02:30 AM;I wonder how that holds up in Japanese;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-May-18 02:30 AM;Sure the name Necron is based on the word for Death Necro;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:30 AM;or an introduction prior to being the last boss;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-May-18 02:30 AM;But in Japanese he's called Eternal Darkness;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:30 AM;right;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:30 AM;the idea that there is no life after death;;

Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:30 AM;Kuja's ultimate fear;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;31-May-18 02:30 AM;I don't really mind its existence anyway 👀;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:30 AM;Kuja was terrified of dying;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:31 AM;that's where Necron came from;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:32 AM;it's not a stretch though;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:33 AM;Saying something like Necron is Garland would be a stretch;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:33 AM;or Necron is really Zidane and all the genomes creator;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 02:33 AM;that's a stretch;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 08:59 AM;"Word. I've never understood why people complained about Necron when the whole theme of IX is life and death. Necron's being what is essentially death incarnate gives everyone—including kuja—something to fight against. Even Necron didn't quite understand why people rebelled against death, so it could be said that the entire party's journey is thematically just that.";;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 09:00 AM;"Also interesting to note that Hades was originally the intended to be the final boss (same thing conceptually as Necron, basically)";;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 09:02 AM;"Necron doesn't need character development because his character (death) is prominent in all themes and avenues of the story. Always seemed like Kuja was an immature, narcissistic child who couldn't bear the thought of his own death, so in a way confronting death itself and shutting it down is almost like redemption";;
Yukito#2049;31-May-18 11:20 AM;Final boss should've been Baku;;
Yukito#2049;31-May-18 11:20 AM;"It was me all along, Zidane! GWA! HA! HA! HA! HA!";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;31-May-18 11:21 AM;KONO DIO DA;;
Yukito#2049;31-May-18 11:22 AM;Or Cinna. He remembered what Zidane said about his face;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 11:27 AM;the whole tantalus crew are just hideous monsters;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:05 PM;Yea I mean at least Baku has a backstory right?;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:05 PM;that's the requirement for a final boss;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:05 PM;but what if the final boss didn't exist until the events right before it? 🤔;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:05 PM;How would something like that EVEN HAVE A BACKSTORY?!;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:05 PM;Oh right it couldn't;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:08 PM;i've kind of learned to love the out-of-nowhere final boss;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:09 PM;I guess Necro only makes sense to me;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:09 PM;it's weird;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:10 PM;it's like I understand what it represents and why it's there but everyone else says it's out of place;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:10 PM;"When Kuja destroyed the link between Lifa and Memoria, Necro was awakened, or brought into existence";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:11 PM;"it sensed something's desire to end all life, and was thusly born";;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:11 PM;yup;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:11 PM;i feel like it was also a bit of a throwback to Chaos;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:12 PM;I know Kuja isn't a summoner but he did control Deathgaze?;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:12 PM;err Deathguise;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:12 PM;so maybe Necro was summoned by him similarly idk;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:13 PM;now -that's- a stretch;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:13 PM;I think Kuja casting Ultima and destroying the crystal is what woke Necron up;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:13 PM;it's more like the first thing you said: he's the essence of death and kuja's actions (as the angel of death) brought about his appearance;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:13 PM;"Necron was like welp someone wants to destroy all life, time for me to do my work";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:13 PM;yea;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:14 PM;because kuja's ultima essentially killed everyone;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:14 PM;yea;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:15 PM;including most of Memoria;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:15 PM;"yup. man, people can talk whatever shit they want--necron rules";;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:15 PM;and i think it was ballsy to make him the final boss;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:17 PM;"yea because as a lot of people say, it's not something they expected for a last boss";;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:17 PM;the necron fight is also like 10x tougher than kuja;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:17 PM;I can't think of a lot of other final bosses that are as symbolic to the main antagonists goals as Necron;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:17 PM;Which makes Necron unique;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:18 PM;"Now, Yu Yevon as a final boss was expected but weird";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:18 PM;also the fact that it was a giant tick;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:18 PM;o_0;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:18 PM;YUP;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:18 PM;i think yu yevon fucking sucks;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:18 PM;"oh yeah, we have to fight him now";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;I was just hoping Jecht would be the final boss;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;in the heart of Sin or something;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;and then they're like;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;no you have to fight our god now;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:19 PM;"it's not just yu yevon that stinks, though--it's the fact that you have to fight the aeons AGAIN";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;and then it's like;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;Oh wait Yu Yevon is Sin;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;Yu Yevon created Sin;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:19 PM;or something idk;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:19 PM;the whole last part of X is really rushed and poorly done imo;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:20 PM;i like most of the ending but the final dungeon really sucks. the game just loses steam after yunalesca imo;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:20 PM;ye;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:21 PM;i guess VIII has a bit of a wtf final boss with Griever;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:22 PM;You mean Mr. Kitty;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:23 PM;"Mr. Kitty, make them bleed!";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:23 PM;Here Squallyyyy name ur keychain :3c;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:23 PM;Me: Uhhh... *Mr. Kitty*;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:23 PM;8 hours later;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:24 PM;Ultimecia: The most powerful GF... Mr. Kitty!;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:24 PM;Me: Well fuck;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:25 PM;Ultimecia kinda makes sense but what makes less sense is Rinoa?;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:25 PM;I mean she's supposed to be a sorceress;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:25 PM;And Ultimecia i- oh wait never mind I answered my own question;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:25 PM;Ultimecia is an amalgamation of all the sorceresses throughout the timelines;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:25 PM;And I think she was controlling Adel in Squall's timeline;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:26 PM;and she tried to get Adel to absorb Rinoa to increase her powers;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:27 PM;Squall stopped Adel from absorbing Rinoa;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:43 PM;"ooo yeah, true";;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 12:43 PM;"man, i need to replay VIII";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 12:52 PM;8 had the best card game;;
Yukito#2049;31-May-18 01:01 PM;"9 had the best card game*, , FTFY";;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:10 PM;ew;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:10 PM;no;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:10 PM;in reality;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:10 PM;cards in a card game should not level up or change stats;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:10 PM;like;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:11 PM;can you imagine playing pokemon tcg;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:11 PM;and someone brings in a deck that is exactly like yours;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:11 PM;except they have higher leveled cards?;;
Carmine#9363;31-May-18 01:11 PM;like how does that even make sense;;
Joie#2226;31-May-18 01:35 PM;i've never understood why anyone would ever like tetra master more than triple triad;;

assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:40 PM;wait;;
assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:41 PM;"so, profesor gast and lucrecia made sephiroth";;
assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:43 PM;and gast with ifelna made aerith;;
assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:43 PM;so;;
assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:43 PM;does that mean that sephiroth and aerith are brothers?;;
assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:45 PM;im confused;;
assholemon#0823;02-Jun-18 07:45 PM;because i don't know if it's gast or hojo;;
IYNH#5142;02-Jun-18 08:42 PM;That line of dialogue reminds me of teedus for some reason;;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 01:05 PM;"well, i beat the game";https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/452895725269942282/20180603130301_1.jpg;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 01:06 PM;and it's quite the contrast;;
Nezar 凶#5027;03-Jun-18 01:57 PM;"Professor Hojo is Sephiroth's Father, not Professor Gast.";;
Brentleton#1020;03-Jun-18 02:22 PM;Actually it's professor oak;;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 02:46 PM;cloud's identity;;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 02:46 PM;and how in a certain part sephiroth shows cloud that part of his memory interpretations is zack's;;
Carmine#9363;03-Jun-18 02:47 PM;Crisis Core covers that part nicely;;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 02:47 PM;and when you see cloud's interpretation you see how you think one thing but it's really another thing;;
Carmine#9363;03-Jun-18 02:47 PM;Including the weird scratches on the inside of the tanks;;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 02:47 PM;though in crisis core i imagine is how it's actually like;;
Carmine#9363;03-Jun-18 02:47 PM;"in the bottom of Shin Ra mansion, aka the Resident Evil mansion";;
assholemon#0823;03-Jun-18 02:47 PM;and in a bigger detail;;

assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:40 AM;and lowkey to have revenge on shinra;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:40 AM;"but yeah, it explains more things about the modified solders";;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:40 AM;and how sephiroth got the best treatment instead of angeal and genesis;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:41 AM;It does tie certain things well;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:42 AM;though some are clearly made to give more story about things unrelated of main ff7 canon;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:42 AM;"still, those are enjoyable too";;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:42 AM;though they retconed the part of zack and seph entereing the reactor;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:43 AM;but i do like how they expanded the story of zack;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:43 AM;it helped a lot;;
assholemon#0823;10-Jun-18 02:45 AM;and this only cements the idea that hojo is the main villain;;

Bounty#0474;10-Jun-18 05:58 AM;Seems rather arbitrary;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 05:59 AM;"The chocobo race had balloons on the track, each balloon you get reduces your final time by some seconds (I think it was 2 seconds)";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 05:59 AM;So you had to get the balloons and reach the finish in a good time frame;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 05:59 AM;BUT !;;
Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:00 AM;THERE'S A BUT;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:00 AM;There were small birds programmed like homing missiles coming from the opposite of the track;;
Bounty#0474;10-Jun-18 06:00 AM;~~Is it a big but?~~;;
Bounty#0474;10-Jun-18 06:00 AM;Oh god;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:00 AM;"Each time you got hit by a bird, you get a 2 secs penalty";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:01 AM;"So it ends up being often RNG, and luck based";;
Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:01 AM;Oh damn;;
Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:01 AM;Congrats on doing it 😄;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:01 AM;You can somewhat understand the rythm of the birds appearing and how they'll fly;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:01 AM;But it's still a pain;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:02 AM;"You can still finish the main story without bothering with the ultimate weapons, though";;
Bounty#0474;10-Jun-18 06:02 AM;I don't think I've gotten anyone's ultimate weapon in a game where you aren't just given them.;;
Bounty#0474;10-Jun-18 06:02 AM;"Oh wait, no, I got everyone's weapon in FFIV DS";;
Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:04 AM;Haha XD;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:07 AM;@Baguette Cat#6233 since you're here;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:07 AM;I just got to the Calm Lands;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:07 AM;Can I skip all this chocobo shenanigans for the time being? lol;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:07 AM;Just want to move on with the story for now tbh.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:07 AM;"The GBA and PSP remakes of FF4 were better in most of ways, you could keep all the characters for the last part, and the bonus dungeon Lunar Ruins had some accessories that upgraded each characters exclusive commands";;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:08 AM;...should've worded that better;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:08 AM;"Yeah, you can dodge that for now, it's not like you won't get access to the ultimate weapons for a bit of time";;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:08 AM;Is there anything missable there that I need to complete right now?;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:08 AM;oh okay then;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:09 AM;"It's not sarcastic, I mean it. The ultimate weapons have another requirement that'll be available once you have the flying ship";;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:09 AM;Some special magic mirror key item;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:10 AM;So you can just drop the chocobo race for now;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:10 AM;tbh I'll probably never get back to them anyway;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:11 AM;I still have my FF I save file hanging for when I want to do the extra dungeons lol;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:11 AM;(I finished FF I exactly one year ago);;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:11 AM;More so that winning the chocobo race actually move an npc that is currently barring you from reaching the sealed Ultimate Tidus weapon;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:12 AM;"If you don't have the mirror, you can't get the weapon, so even if you win twice the race with 0 sec, you'll have then to win once again after getting the mirror";;
Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:12 AM;...;;
Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:12 AM;These requirements XD;;

Taistealai#2608;10-Jun-18 06:22 AM;Some of those requirements got me crying;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:25 AM;I can pinpoint the exact time I started questioning my existence;;
Marcello#4574;10-Jun-18 06:25 AM;And that was when I decided to do the Chocobo Hot and Cold minigame in IX;;
Baguette Cat#6233;10-Jun-18 06:25 AM;"If you enjoy grinding in Blitzball, Wakka's ultimate isn't so hard to get, but it's still RNG relying -__-";;

Neon_#1876;18-Jun-18 10:05 PM;Yeah this is from the Dawn of Souls version. I read it was a playful jab at Nintendo since Squaresoft was competing mainly against tloz and dragon quest at the time;;

Brentleton#1020;19-Jun-18 01:25 AM;also @Illixir#6703  for fighting seymour the 3rd time should I just keep spamming my summons? I have all their overdrives built up for it or is there some kind of strategy bc eventually his cleave move just one shots my party;;

Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 01:47 AM;Should protect you from Cleave;;
Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 01:51 AM;Use Yunas Null spells too;;
Brentleton#1020;19-Jun-18 02:30 AM;okay so right off the bat he used full life on yuna and then used cross cleave to kill riku and then used full life on my last character all in the first fucking turn;;
Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 02:47 AM;Do you have any holy waters;;
Brentleton#1020;19-Jun-18 02:48 AM;yeah;;

Brentleton#1020;19-Jun-18 03:09 AM;but he used total annihilation and one shoted the whole party;;

Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 03:17 AM;Apparently the trick is to not use overdrives;;
Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 03:17 AM;Because he counters it with Ultima and then uses his next turn;;
Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 03:18 AM;So i just spammed quick hit and hyper mighty guard;;
Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 03:18 AM;And had yuna cast auto life on whoever died that wasnt a group kill;;
Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 03:19 AM;Another reason i consider Rikku the best character is because theres almost no way to beat these super bosses without her Mix overdrive;;

Illixir#6703;19-Jun-18 04:43 PM;Aerith is highly under rated. She understood what was happening to Cloud better than he did by then. As she was an Ancient she was probably able to sense that he was poisoned by Mako to an extreme level. This could also be why she asks if he can help the man with the tattoo at the entrance to the sector 6 slums. Because if he had found a way to maintain his sanity perhaps he could help the tattooed man at the entrance;;

RazorBlack#8566;21-Jun-18 05:01 PM;It's like they're adding in pieces to make the story better. Point being why not release the fully realized story at once;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 02:17 AM;Equipment's worth in FFX is only  in their abilities;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 02:18 AM;"So unless you want to keep a certain ability, be it because it's unique, useful to you or hard to come by, you can probably sell them";;

Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:19 AM;"Just you - he's a decent choice, in part for his accuracy against small fliers, but his strength is mostly down to how you've traversed the Sphere Grid by that point.";;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:19 AM;"Admittedly, there are a lot of enemies in the Calm Lands that he does well against.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:19 AM;Him and lulu just obliterate everything;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:20 AM;Lulu does that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:20 AM;Kimahri is useless and Tidus and Auron do sub-1k damage;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:21 AM;"Auron should do more - but again, the Sphere Grid and the paths you take in it, can fuck you over.";;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:22 AM;"If you've gotten to the Monster Arena yet, you could try and see if you can get Tidus' sword with capture + death touch/strike there";;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:22 AM;"Helps a ton with capturing, and for weaker enemies it helps making him feel useful if he's doing low damage";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 03:23 AM;What's the difference between -strike and -touch abilities ? Activation rate ?;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:25 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:26 AM;"If I recall correctly, -touch is the low chance (at 30% or so), and -strike is the high chance (at 70% or so).";;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:26 AM;I should probably look those up;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:30 AM;Ah -touch is 50% and -strike is 100% and it is possible to have both on one weapon.;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:30 AM;Which helps against enemies with partial resistance to certain status effects.;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 03:31 AM;Neat;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 03:31 AM;Is the chance calculated multiplicatively or additively with the enemy's resistance ?;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:32 AM;Additively... I believe;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 03:35 AM;I see;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;27-Jun-18 03:35 AM;"So if you stack both, then any enemy with less than 50% resistance gets hit 100% of the time ?";;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:35 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:36 AM;In the case of Death - that is particularly useful since a lot of the larger enemies have partial resistance to it;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:43 AM;Stonetouch is fucking busted btw;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:44 AM;For random encounters anyway;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:46 AM;Yup;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:46 AM;It is basically the best way to get something similar to Deathtouch early on;;
Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:47 AM;Because few of the early enemies have petrification resistance;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:47 AM;"Oh speaking of which, about how far am I through the game, percentage-wise? I just beat the huge stone golem thing and now I'm in a dungeon where Lulu's first summoner died";;

Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:53 AM;Full-Life is the X one;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:53 AM;Alright;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;27-Jun-18 03:54 AM;Perhaps taking the expert sphere grid was not the best choice;;

Malfred#1000;27-Jun-18 03:59 AM;Oh Rikku's expert path has quite a few magic nodes;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:13 PM;Orphan was Cocoon's power supply;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:13 PM;The only thing keeping it in the sky;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;The L'cie got bamboozled by Barthandelus into destroying it;;
action warrior#8892;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;So why did they seek it out and destroy it;;
action warrior#8892;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;How;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;Bambooooozled;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;Yeah that's kinda where 13 falls apart;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;There really isn't a reason;;
action warrior#8892;01-Jul-18 01:14 PM;So how come everything ends up fine once orphan is destroyed;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:15 PM;So;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;Etro;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;"Since the L'cie completed their focus (which is weird, considering Etro removed their brands), Fang turns into Ragnarok, then she and fang bring up a towering pillar of lava from the world below, followed by crystallizing it when they turn into crystal and holding up the world";;
action warrior#8892;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;What is etro;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;Etro is one of the actual Gods of the world;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;"Along with Pulse, Bhunivelze and Mwynn";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;She lives in valhalla;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:16 PM;Her changing the outcome in the real world is how the plot for ff13-2 starts;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;Chaos and such;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;"Yeah, basically";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;Isn’t lindzei one too?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;"Oh right, and Lindzei";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;I thought I was forgetting one;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;That was the one who made cocoon I think;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;Correct;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:17 PM;And the falcie;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:18 PM;Lindzei and Pulse both made their own Fal'cie;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:18 PM;Oh yeah there’s the pulse ones too;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:19 PM;I just wish 13 ended better because there really is no good reason for the party to kill Orphan;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:19 PM;Other than generic anime We live to make the impossible possible! nonsense;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:20 PM;"Well I mean you’re right, I still don’t really know besides it was orphan or them";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:20 PM;Also we overreach you haHAA;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:20 PM;Considering orphan was trying to kill them;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:20 PM;Barty mentioned that if they didn't do it then he'd find someone else who will;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:20 PM;But Barty was dead;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:20 PM;"Most likely bluff, tho";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;"At the time he was immortal, he literally could do that";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;"His plan hinged on having a Pulse Fal'Cie at his disposal, and Anima is dead";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;:thonkung:;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;Well Barty was immortal so given time he could do it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;But by this point we killed the Barthandelus/Orphan hybrid;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;Once he was dead there was no reason to fight Orphan;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:21 PM;"Probably, but it would take very, very long until a Pulse Fal'Cie would wind up on Cocoon";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:22 PM;"Yeah, but still. Time is apparently not a problem for the Fal'cie";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:22 PM;"Anima got there during the War of Transgression. With no Pulse inhabitants, there was not going to be a way";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:22 PM;The only way that would be feasible again would be if the Pulse and Cocoon fal'cie were in cahoots;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:22 PM;Which is a point left ambiguous;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:22 PM;The reason wouldn't have to make sense. The population of Cocoon are stupid and easily manipulated by design.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:23 PM;They could initiate some kind of recovery effort;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:23 PM;"But yeah, nothing says it would be completely impossible";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:23 PM;But it wouldn't be as easy as he implies;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:23 PM;Or early;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:24 PM;"It would just take time, something the Fal'Cie have in abundance";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:24 PM;Too much time on their hands 👀;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:26 PM;My problem is that everything *after* Barthandelus dies makes no sense;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:26 PM;The fal'Cie cannot self-terminate.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:26 PM;Barty is dead;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:26 PM;There is no reason to kill Orphan;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:27 PM;"I remember reading something about that on the Reddit, but I can't remember exactly what it was";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:27 PM;"Sure it might live in endless self-inflicted agony, but it probably won't ever take a l'cie because nobody ever sees it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:27 PM;"I know someone who does, but I don't have their Discord nick, so I can't summon them here";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:28 PM;Not even sure they're on the Discord;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:28 PM;Yeah I'm trying to recall that reddit post too;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:28 PM;Hang on I upboated it so I should be able to find it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:36 PM;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/7pjbbe/ffxiii_qa_batch_2_cid_raines_barthandelus_orphan?sort=top found it;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:39 PM;Wish it was in XII;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:40 PM;It's in XIII but it might as fuckin well not be considering how long it takes;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Jul-18 01:40 PM;They just put you on training wheels for 10 chapters instead;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:40 PM;Yeah seeing tutorials two-thirds through the game is not my idea of good game design;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:41 PM;The last *actual* tutorial in XIII is in Chapter 4;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:41 PM;Only a few primers after that;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:41 PM;It's more akin to an obstacle course past that last Tutorial;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:42 PM;"Also, not 10 Chapter, but 8.75";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:42 PM;"The point is, they're still introducing new concepts late in the game";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:42 PM;Like what ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:42 PM;We can say the tutorial lasts until Chapter 12 with that logic;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:42 PM;Since you get Full-ATB skills at the earliest in Chapter 12;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:42 PM;The worst example is unlocking the entire crystarium for everyone;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:43 PM;It's such a trap;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:43 PM;How is it a trap ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:43 PM;There's some worthwhile early investment in it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:43 PM;"If you think it's exclusive to post-game, you're mistaken";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:43 PM;I think they should have locked it until post-game;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;The benefits you get early are minimal and they burn a TON of cp;;
Chimpy#5375;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;I don't really think FF13 gives you all the options till at least Grand Pulse right? You're still stuck with 2 party members for a good chunk of the game and when you do get 3 it's still the 3 your'e forced to use right?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;No you get party management at the end of Ch 9;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;One thing at a time;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;Secondary roles do burn quite a lot of CP;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;But some investments can be *definitely* worth it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;The stats ? No;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:44 PM;The abilities and access to roles ? Heck yeah;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:45 PM;Having access to SEN on all characters doesn't cost much;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:45 PM;Getting Hope's COM is vital to his viability;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:45 PM;"Getting Fang's RAV, too, similarly";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:45 PM;These are all fairly cheap for what benefit they give you;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:45 PM;"Then you have slightly deeper abilities, which cost more (which is scary to invest) but are still worth it";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:46 PM;"Fang's Bravera, Sazh's Poison and Imperil";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:46 PM;"i didn't mind the secondary's being so expensive they were practically end game, it lets you use any character you want to have similiar teams (some fights it's different albeit)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:46 PM;"So no, opening the 6 Roles to everyone isn't post-game only";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:46 PM;"Thing is, that's all entirely optional and can be countered with good paradigm setups";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;yeah that's true;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;"Once again, not exactly";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;Some teams *might* have the same Role composition you're aiming for as another;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;i just liked being able to hold onto my favourite characters for the duration of the game;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;"And think about it this way: If you're playing blind, you have no fuckin idea what you're doing. So you dump points into something useless and get fuck-all out of it.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;But not the same ability access;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;Sazh/Snow/Fang has *no way* to inflict Imperil or Poison in Chapter 11 unless you get some of Sazh's SAB;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:47 PM;"Yeah, you have no idea what you're doing because the game explains shit poorly";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;But that doesn't mean it's absurd to think one would invest in such things;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;"No, I'm saying they *will*";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;"And without guidance, they'll fuck it up";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;Well maybe they should think it through a bit more;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;You vastly overestimate your average dumbfuck;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;"If the game explained Role Bonuses, maybe they'd realise how good SEN/SEN/SEN can be";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;And would try to get it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:48 PM;People are stupid as hell;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:49 PM;"Or if maybe 90% of the players didn't think COM dealt Physical damage, they'd get Hope's COM";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:49 PM;"Yeah, but that's not on the game if the player is a mouth-breathing lobotomized moron";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:49 PM;i think they expected players to assume they werent supposed to instantyl cash into secondaries cuz they were so damn expensive;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:49 PM;Except you get massive amounts of CP in Chapter 11;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:49 PM;"btw I just want to make it clear, I'm not defending this game in any way, I think the whole tutorial system and crystarium needs to be overhauled";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;even then;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;Because it's dumb;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;I've also seen plenty of casual players invest in the secondaries;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;And sets the player up for failure;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;"even when farming, you got very little stat upgrades out of secondaries";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;Stats are useless in this game;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;Except HP;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:50 PM;A combination of 4buff/debuffs multiplies your damage output by 5.3;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;No amount of stats can compensate that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;"Look, like";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;Strats > Stats;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;That's all very good and all;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;The game just doesn't explain how to play it properly;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;well i mean getting +50 strength from a class vs 10 should at least let the player know this isnt waht they should be building for their offensive characters;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;But your average casual player isn't gonna know that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;They just want to get the game over with so they can go see the doctor for the massive tumor it created;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;Then it's not the game for them;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;It's not the game for a lot of people let's be real here;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:51 PM;"They might not know the number, but they could see the synergy";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:52 PM;I'm not saying it is;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:52 PM;Game is straight trash;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:52 PM;It's definitely a niche game in a mainstream series;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:52 PM;i just think someone who got that far without realizing where they have a leveled up com hope in chapter 9 wont like the game or get it anyways;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:52 PM;"They'll put points into something stupid, realize how much CP they're wasting and then go back to leveling their main roles";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:52 PM;With any luck;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:53 PM;I've seen plenty of casual players invest in Secondary roles and actually use them;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:53 PM;"They're not gonna look at Hope, the game's primary magic user, and think Hey maybe I should put some points into COM on this guy";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:53 PM;Yeah;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:53 PM;That's because they're too stupid to READ;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:53 PM;The game tells you the COM deals physical AND magic damage;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;"well, i mean they're useful for some of the end game fights...all characters having sen and com is good. but idk what to tell someone who has level 3 com hope in chapter 9";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;Most people will just mash auto-battle and let Light spam Ruin without even noticing;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;they're just being difficult;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;"Also, his literal first COM crystal is Ruin";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;"I think you mean Chapter 10 or 11, Sir Tonberry";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;You can't get Hope's COM before;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;then yes i meant 10 😂;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:54 PM;"Well if you invest so far into his COM that he gets to Level 3, then maybe there's an issue";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;When you get to 60k CP nodes;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;And you keep going;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;It's just so poorly tutorialized that I think the game as it stands would be better served by locking the crystarium until post-game when the player might have an idea of what they're doing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;"Which never happens, honestly";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;They don't know what they're doing;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;"If the entire system was overhauled, then sure I can see it being unlocked from the start";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;They can just more easily fix their mistakes by grinding more easily than before;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:55 PM;But that's magical christmas land;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;I don't think the system needs an overhaul;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;I think the game needs tutorials that aren't misleading;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;i just think a player who's enjoying it and taking their time with the system can easily acknowledge they shouldnt be putting cp  in secondaries until being profficient in their main classes;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;You just think people need to be less stupid;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;That too;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;Literally *read* spell descriptions;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;List of things that will never happen: 1) People getting smarter;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;I've seen players not read them for the longest time;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:56 PM;I can understand What does Vigilance do exactly as a question;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;As much as I hate game design for the lowest common denominator that's just a thing you have to do these days;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;But What is Deshell is pretty idiotic;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;that hurts;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;Yeah well the game did that;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;The game should have done it more;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;Except the game is actually boring when you're bad at it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;And the game never brings you to being better at it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:57 PM;Because tutorials and information scare players;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;I'm willing to bet that a good amount of dumbfucks hit the Barthandelus 1 wall and dropped the game right there;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;(and some of the few tutorials are misleading or incomplete);;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;That boss.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;I can understand dropping the game at Odin;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;oh man;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;Eidolon fights are fucking stupid;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:58 PM;yeah they're a hassle;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;Yet another example of the game *not telling you fucking anything*;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;Actually;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;The game tells you too much for Eidolons;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;Which is equally misleading;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;Yeah in cryptic double-speak;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;l i b r a;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;also...trial and error;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;"It tells you to use all your Roles, it tells you to do what your character can do";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;When actually;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;They're Chaining contests;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 01:59 PM;Nothing matters nearly as much as chaining against them;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;The way the game implemented them is just awful;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;They're *universally* un-fun;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;Eh;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;And only hard because the game punishes you for not knowing instantly what to do;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;there's a few I liked;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;I think the three-man parties one are fine;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;And Odin with the Swag Strat;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;Brynhildr can go fuck itself;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:00 PM;Hecatoncheir wasn't much better;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;Hecaton is the one fight I actually hate in the game;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;"So long after abandoning two-man parties, you get a fight with such a party";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;Hecaton was the only one (when I played blind) that I immediately knew what to do;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;Blegh;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;I actually beat it first try;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;hecaton was a nightmare in my first run in like 2010;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;I don't think it's hard;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;But I don't think it's fun either;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;It's not fun at all;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:01 PM;the party was just;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:02 PM;i hated it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:02 PM;"I like the *idea* of non-standard fights, but 13 implemented them so poorly";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:02 PM;I actually did something similar in my DnD campaign (oh boy I get to gush about this shit too);;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:02 PM;"The others I'm biased, because I know strats that beat them fairly easily no matter the setup";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:02 PM;"For example: My first eidolon fight was Ishboldig, and it was the party healer's eidolon";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:03 PM;"ishboldig starts the fight by grabbing every other party member, rendering them Inactive, and starts draining their health every turn";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:03 PM;"Ishboldig isn't targetable, so how 2 win?";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:03 PM;Well it's not fuckin hard considering it's the first fight and the introduction to the concept;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:04 PM;See that kind of thing is what I wanted more out of those fights;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:04 PM;Less figure out what we mean by this libra text and more why am I testing you like this?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:05 PM;Each fight is supposed to teach the character something;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;Let's translate this into 13's shit;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;First eidolon fight: Shiva;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;I just beat the bartandulus 1 wall and i beat him;;

Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;I still love ff13;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;Snow sucks;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;Lighr hope fang;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;That lets the player realize oh okay Snow is this game's tank character;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:06 PM;Light*;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:07 PM;And also reminds Snow Oh shit people are depending on me;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:07 PM;That would have been fucking *amazing!*;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:07 PM;Dont worry about snow he sucks anyways;;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:07 PM;Use fang;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:07 PM;"Dude no I'm talking about eidolon fight design, not how good snow is as a character";;
Annoying Dragoon *FUN*#9812;01-Jul-18 02:07 PM;O ok;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:08 PM;Snow is good;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:08 PM;"And for the part of the game you're in, Light/Hope/Fang is probably the second worst team possible";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:08 PM;And the most popular;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:08 PM;And the worst if the goal if Get all Roles in the team;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;"light, snow, vanil was always my go to early game";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;"If you have access to Sazh, you take Sazh";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;Because Sazh has haste;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;Pretty true until Hope gets Haste;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;sab was my favourite class throughout the game;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;Also if you're a speedrunner Sazh is the best character in the game;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;true;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;"Sazh is the best character in the speedrun, but not the game";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:09 PM;Because his Blitz is a cone and it does a ton of damage;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:10 PM;aka it's a shotgun;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:10 PM;The reaason he's good in the speedrun  is because he's good at low-to-mid level development;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:10 PM;"Which is what the speedruns, which dodges all-bar-two fights, is";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:10 PM;"He gets *rapidly* outclassed as you reach higher stats, and his spells aren't exclusive to him anymore";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:11 PM;"He's always a formidable RAV tho, thanks to Cold Blood";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:11 PM;end game i have him just to insta stagger gigantuar with cold blood 😮;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:11 PM;"But Light/Hope/Fang, in Chapter 10 to late 11 is the worsts team";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:11 PM;"it has *no* offensive multiplier available, can get two *situational* ones fairly early";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:12 PM;And takes ages to get some non-situational ones;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:12 PM;"It's thus a slow, overly defensive team";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:12 PM;Light/Fang/Vanille is the troll comp :OMEGALUL:;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:12 PM;That struggles to beat anything is less than 5 minutes;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:12 PM;Light/Fang/Vanille is a good comp;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:12 PM;aw no my nitro expired;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:13 PM;I know but it's just hilarious watching one of the game's three superbosses get cheesed to death like that;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:13 PM;literally;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;Not as hilarious as watching the entire post-game of FFX get cheesed by 8 gil Zanmatos;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;I still need to finish that game;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;I'm getting close to the end of the story I hear;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;You can't farm with a Summon;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;"Or rather, you make your farm loop suboptimal";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;^;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;"So much so, that other farm spots become better";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:14 PM;i had a loop;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 02:15 PM;"You know what i'm gonna do that, I'll launch FFX once I hit Lv50 here in a sec and get something to eat";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:15 PM;"So until you can kill turtles without Summoning, you're better off farming any other farm spot";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:15 PM;i remember doing it for adamantite;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:15 PM;had to get that platinum trophy;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:15 PM;"Oh if you're farming for the Adamantite, not much choice";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:15 PM;It's not worth it *at all* to buy them;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;n e v e r;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;Wait;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;You can't drop Adamantite;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;You have to buy them;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;I think you mean Trapezohedron;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;OOOH;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;yes that is what i meant;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;"Those are even less worth it to buy, considering not only the price";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:16 PM;But the fact you can duplicate them for the same cost (IIRC);;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:18 PM;"Triplicate, even";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:18 PM;that platinum took me forever...;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:18 PM;getting every item in the game?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;"With a guide, you can do it in an afternoon";;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;considering there were items you could easily miss throughout the story that you could never get again;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;no    way    jose;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;Not exactly true;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;it was the farming to upgrade everything;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;The items you could miss during the story;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;there were a few;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;that you couldnt buy after;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:19 PM;You can obtain again by Dismantling equipment found on the Archylte Steppe;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:20 PM;And that makes *every* equipment available *and* unmissable;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:20 PM;could you get them all through that;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:20 PM;hmm;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:20 PM;never knew that;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:20 PM;Yeah;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:20 PM;"For example, you can miss a Spark Ring in Ch3, 4 and 9";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:21 PM;"Miss them all, and the Archylte Steppe has a Lightning Charm";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:21 PM;Dismantling that item gives you a Spark Ring;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:21 PM;Every elemental ring can be obtained by dismantling the corresponding Charm;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:21 PM;And only Elemental rings are missable;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:21 PM;All elemental charms are available in Chapter 11;;
Dech#1756;01-Jul-18 02:21 PM;that would've been nice to know when starting a new file to get everything buuuut;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 02:23 PM;I can imagine 👀;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 02:50 PM;"You can farm turtles with summoning pretty early on, and the one you can fight on Cocoon provides the most lucrative way to farm gil and trapezos long after you're maxed out. I can drop it in 2 minutes and you can make a massive amount of money or if your lucky get all the trapezos you'll ever need.";;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 02:52 PM;"Dropping it by summons and employing massive damage shaves a lot of time off your farming, even when you don't need to summon.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 03:18 PM;"Well that's if you Summon when you have the TP, but don't use it when you don't";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;01-Jul-18 03:18 PM;"If your loop includes Summoning every fight, it's inefficient, because you then need to refill your TP, and no method exists that is fast enough to compensate";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:37 PM;OH GREAT;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:37 PM;THERE'S A KIMAHRI GATEKEEPER;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:37 PM;TO SEE IF YOU'VE BEEN LEVELING KIMAHRI PROPERLY;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:37 PM;AAAAA;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:43 PM;And then I forgot to lancet things to learn skills;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:43 PM;fuck;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:44 PM;Okay this fight isn't hard but I need to lancet shit;;
Trickster#9840;01-Jul-18 03:47 PM;Yeah that fight's bosses stats scales to kimahri's stats;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 03:48 PM;"Kimahri is a BEAST tho, both literally and figuratively";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 03:48 PM;He can one shot Sinspawn Gui;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 03:49 PM;"Wait nvm, not really but I did get him to do 9999 damage with Self Destruct xD and he somehow lived with 1 hp after overkilling the boss. I don't remember how that happened";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:50 PM;I just cast haste on kimahri and spam lancet;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:57 PM;Oh yay I got instantly obliterated by a random encounter without getting a chance to act;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:57 PM;Fun;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;01-Jul-18 03:58 PM;Now I get to listen to the ronso song again;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:15 PM;"@NijiBashira/虹柱#7292 the area with the turtle on Cocoon has beasts to refill your TP afterwords, or in my case, just save the game with 5 TP, battle and use 3, and simply reload your save of you don't get a drop. Even normally, it only takes 2 or 3 fights from normals to refill TP, so it is in fact the most efficient method.";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:16 PM;wait;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:16 PM;Almost my entire inventory is at max from using this method at only 250 hours and I have everything possible to obtain;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:16 PM;people use summons to beat the turtles?;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:16 PM;o_O;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:16 PM;isn't that way slower?;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:16 PM;Yeah but the trick is to not use gestalt mode;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:18 PM;"Nah I can drop it in 2 minutes by buffing party to max, summon, he drops, debuff the head, wait till the summon timer runs out (ignore gestalt so the gauge sustains), party comes back, debuff more, switch to all commandos then boom 100k+ damage every strike with everyone";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:18 PM;"pop shrouds, debuff both legs, stagger and eliminate both legs, debuff head, stagger, build up to 980% stagger, switch to COM COM COM and unleash until about 2/5ths hp, and use Highwind with Fang it should do 999,999 x 2";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:18 PM;I can do it in 1:15;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:18 PM;I'm pretty sure;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:18 PM;maybe faster;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:20 PM;"You're wasting your money buying shrouds that way,  so any extra money you use to repurchase is kinda counter productive";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:20 PM;not really;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:20 PM;if you're farming specifically for an item and it doesn't drop you just reload;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:20 PM;and your shroud isn't wasted;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:20 PM;since 1 shroud = 1 item;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:22 PM;"I never felt the need to bother using shrouds with my method, plus when you debuff legs you gotta deal with tortoise switching in between the process which after awhile can be annoying. With my way you only have to guard one time";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:23 PM;I don't ever use Sentinel during the fight;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:23 PM;I usually win with critical HP though;;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:23 PM;just need earth damage reduction and physical damage reduction accessories;;
dohburman#3419;01-Jul-18 04:25 PM;"I mean you could, but I use auto haste, bravery, faith along with genji gloves on all members because there's no need to reduce base damage if 3 sentinels will basically nullify the attack at the beginning";;
Carmine#9363;01-Jul-18 04:49 PM;"Without shroud 1:30~1:29, with shroud 1:04";;

AbroadKew#1016;02-Jul-18 03:16 PM;"Noct and his bros (Ignis, Prompto, Gladious) leave Insomnia by the bidding Noct father, the King. They're to road trip to another area for a politically beneficial marriage of Noct and the Oracle, Luna., , The Oracle has the power to speak to the Gods. Noct and Luna have history, so the marriage isn’t as bleak as it sounds. This is not important yet., , We don't know why they're sent on this road trip instead of doing everything in Insomnia but if you watch Kingsglaive (movie), you'll learn why. I recommend it. Also, you should watch Brotherhood, the anime. It really helps in the attachment to the four bros., , The car breaks down early and you meet Cindy and Cid, mechanics who help you with your car. Cid has history with the King, but it isn't relevant yet. Cindy is wearing weird clothes for being a mechanic. This being outside the capital city, you’re generally not known to be the Prince., , Add typical side quests., , Your destination is the docks to go to Altissa. It's where you're to be married. The docks are closed due to the Empire, your fathers and your kingdoms enemies. You meet a reporter who knows who you are. If you find a stone for him, he'll get you a boat AND not tell anybody who you are., , Surprisingly, he makes good on his deal. You spend the night at the hotel waiting for the boat. Unfortunately, when you awake is when you find out the kingdom has fallen, and your father is dead. (watch Kingsglaive)";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Jul-18 03:16 PM;"You decide to skip the boat and go back to Insomnia. You see the destruction with your own eyes. Thankfully though some have made it out alive. The captain of the Kingsguard, Cor and Gladiolus little sister, Iris., , You first meet with Cor. He brings you to a tomb that holds one of your ancestors. You take his kingly powers and can now call upon his weapon. Cor tells you that you need to find them all if you're to take back your home., , Add some quests about taking down Empire strongholds and various side quests., , You finally yourself to the town that Iris is now a refugee in. You find her with an older man in service of the king as a sort of historian and his grandson., , As you all explore the city and catch up, the grandson casually mentions a myth of a hidden weapon behind a waterfall. To you and your bros this sounds like a tomb., , It's time to find out.";;
AbroadKew#1016;02-Jul-18 03:16 PM;"One last note I added:, , When the King was killed, the Crystal that gives the King and City power that was granted by the Gods was stolen by the Empire. There is a ring that is needed in conjunction with the crystal that the Empire was unable to find. The Empire announced that you and the Oracle, Luna were dead but you know at this point that neither of you is.";;

Timothy#5317;06-Jul-18 12:22 AM;"kk so some questions about ff3 endgame (world of darkness). I have the best items/gear in the game (afaik) and own every encounter in WoD easily (except bosses) and killed Xande in 2 turns. Yet I am still dying to the two-headed dragon., , 1) How many shurkain should I get before WoD? I have 10, should I go for 15-20 and spam them on the bosses?, , 2) What lvl do you think is safe to grind to for the win? That is, what lvl should I be before CoD?, , 3) my team is devout monk warrior ninja... should i change the monk or is this okay? also is getting job level 99 a big deal?";;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:26 AM;Job lvl 99 is a really big deal for physical class;;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:27 AM;Not so much for magical classes because they are still going to suck anyway;;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:31 AM;"For the final boss, I remember beating in in the low 40s or something, but I would say most people beat it in the 50s";;
Timothy#5317;06-Jul-18 12:34 AM;ill get job lvl 99 then. If you did it in the 40s then I should be fine if i get to the mid 50s since I have the best items.... hm this game paralyzes me bcus I don't want to die in WoD again lol;;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:34 AM;Good xp/money grinding spot is in the bahamut lair floor 1 with a bunch of drakes;;

Timothy#5317;06-Jul-18 12:43 AM;"i think ill lvl a viking and a blackbelt on the same character, use the blackbelt to get to WoD bosses and then viking to tank them";;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:43 AM;"Viking does alright atk wise; not spectacular but enough for non boss battles";;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:44 AM;"Grinding to job lvl99 is boring because it involves meditating for hours in the first cave, so might as well save the trouble and not grind 2 classes";;
Timothy#5317;06-Jul-18 12:46 AM;"lol, so viking is not best for bosses? I only will have trouble on the last bosses, so I guess I'll go for blackbelt";;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:46 AM;"Viking's job in boss battles is to sit in back row, hold 2 shields and taunt the boss to waste all physical atks on him";;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:48 AM;"This should synergize well with Warrior's advance, since the def reduction is meaningless without something to hit it";;
Timothy#5317;06-Jul-18 12:49 AM;"ah okay, so a viking can actually tank a boss then.. I didn't know because I haven't really used them yet";;
Timothy#5317;06-Jul-18 12:50 AM;"then I will juts level a viking over my monk, and then use the viking on boss battles";;
IYNH#5142;06-Jul-18 12:52 AM;"Also the quicksave is not very well designed, so you can just reset boss fights or evade random encounters by quitting the game mid battle";;

GrandGTO#7538;11-Jul-18 10:00 AM;"What do you think about this view of FFVII Remake  :, , Part 1 -> FFVII from the beginning of the story to the moment when Cloud falls into a post traumatic coma. It's a good introduction for all characters, the world and its environmental issues (the planet, the Mako energy, the Shinra and its influence on the world, etc.), , Part 2 -> Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, to explain why Cloud is so distubed in his mind and to better understand who Zack is for Cloud. Learn where the famous sword comes from and the relationship Zack, Aeris and Cloud. Also to explain the madness of Sephiroth. This is also the time to introduce the Genesis character and boosted soldiers by Mako. Understand why Sephiroth sometimes appears with angel wings like Genesis and Angeal (Zack's mentor)., , Part 3 -> We find Cloud in FFVII who tries to save himself from his coma with the help of his friends. Part 2 really helps us to understand why Cloud was so traumatized. We also know all the issues of the battle that will await us at the North crater., , What do you think of this configuration? Do you have another opinion?";;

Bounty#0474;12-Jul-18 02:47 PM;"For me, the hardest boss I've fought was Zeromus. Technically, I only died once, but that's because when I realized what I was up against I ground levels up and above 90.";;

Expanding Storm III#7924;12-Jul-18 02:48 PM;I came to the conclusion that i need atleast 5 levels on each char;;
Bounty#0474;12-Jul-18 02:48 PM;Who are you fighting?;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;12-Jul-18 02:49 PM;Gizamaluke a boss;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;12-Jul-18 02:49 PM;i'm just grinding outside now;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;12-Jul-18 02:49 PM;Need so many levels i guess;;

Trickster#9840;12-Jul-18 03:22 PM;Could've used the tent trick on gizamaluke;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Jul-18 03:40 PM;"The tent trick never worked in my favor. Like the game knows what's up, and the boss wrecks me";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Jul-18 03:40 PM;I've been conditioned to not use the tent trick;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;12-Jul-18 04:55 PM;What is the tent trick;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;12-Jul-18 04:57 PM;"Basically, you can use tents in battle, but they give a number of different negative status aliments (not sure why). You can use them on enemies/bosses.";;
Trickster#9840;12-Jul-18 05:43 PM;When you use a tent battle it heals the target and has a chance to be bitten by a poison/blind/silence snake. Its useful to use in a few boss battles that can be hit with those ailments.;;

AbroadKew#1016;14-Jul-18 04:26 AM;How are there still ifrits and shivas?;;
AbroadKew#1016;14-Jul-18 04:26 AM;Are they not already magicite?;;
AbroadKew#1016;14-Jul-18 04:26 AM;"Or is Ifrit, the esper a species of esper?";;
AbroadKew#1016;14-Jul-18 04:26 AM;And each one is an individual?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 05:17 AM;It can be attributed to lazyness;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 05:17 AM;It's easier to simply color swap existing sprites for temporary espers than create completely new ones;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 05:19 AM;"If you pay attention to when the door of espers open, you can see dupes of espers you're already owning as magicites";;
✦ 𝕍𝕖𝕣𝕚𝕥𝕪 ✦#4657;14-Jul-18 08:19 AM;hello the spoiler;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:09 AM;They are all espers in 6;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:09 AM;Shiva and Ifrit were just the ones not turned into magicites at the time;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 11:15 AM;"That's not what he asked for. Despite getting Shiva and Ifrit as magicites after fighting them in the Magitek Factory, you still see another one, but with different colors, fighting against Kefka. Same goes with a Shiva getting out of the Esper world door.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:16 AM;Simple solution;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:16 AM;There never was a confirmation there's only one of each esper;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 11:16 AM;"So his question was if they were a species, since they were 2 individuals appearing in game.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Jul-18 11:17 AM;It was the Shiva in FF5 :P;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:17 AM;Species or lazy developers I want to believe the latter;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 11:17 AM;"And I said that it can be explained with lazyness, or, to be less harsh, on practicality";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Jul-18 11:17 AM;"I wouldn't say lazyness, but more of hardware limitations";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;14-Jul-18 11:18 AM;Square was already pushing the SNES/Super Famicom to it's limits at it was;;
Baguette Cat#6233;14-Jul-18 11:18 AM;Why bothering making an all new sprite for something that appears for barely 2 seconds on screen (that other Shiva) or something you wouldn't be able to get (that other Ifrit fighting Kefka);;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:18 AM;True;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:18 AM;But let's be real;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:19 AM;Phoenix as a magicite is useful;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:19 AM;Also true;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;14-Jul-18 11:20 AM;For a 2 second scene with them it ain't worth;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 03:49 PM;"A few tips: Things aren't as random as you think. The birds attack by a pattern alternating between Tidus, and the Trainer. At the start, you want a set up of 6-7 balloons at the right. Angle *slightly* towards them, and you *should* get all of them. This **will** give you a fighting chance. For every bird you hit, you'll need at least 2 more balloons to break even, on time loss.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:54 PM;"Crap, I'm gonna be drunk and high again by the end of the night.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:54 PM;I was in FINE final fantasy form last night though so maybe it'll work again;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:55 PM;Working in the cannabis industry has been great in making me drink less... but last night and tonight I've chosen to drink and get high...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:55 PM;bad combo;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:55 PM;although i wasn't really hung over this morning;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 07:55 PM;"Here's the thing about Ultima in 7, he'll be randomly flying around the Overworld, so you'll have to chase him until he stops. There are some fixed locations where he *can* show up. You'll know it's safe to fight him when he has stopped and is preparing an attack. You'll get into battle, deal enough damage, and he'll fly away. My recommendation is to chase him, and when he stops, land, heal, save, and then fight him. You'll know you've got him when he's near Cosmo Canyon. You'll first spot him near that one crater (not to be confused with Northern Crater). Also, do note he *can* show up near Cosmo Canyon before, so it's not a fool proof method, just his final resting place.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 07:56 PM;"As for my favorite FF, it's 9.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 07:56 PM;"Top three would probably be 9, 6, 10";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:57 PM;VI is one of my favorite games of all time.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;26-Jul-18 07:57 PM;which is why I decided to play VII. I love VII too but not as much as VI (as of right now at the beginning of disc 2).;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 08:02 PM;"But yeah, I would recommend going back to Nibelheim, once you've reached Disc 3. Go back to the basement, near the test tubes. Fighting Ultima Weapon, Sunken Ship (watch out for Emerald Weapon), Ancient Forest (requires Black or Gold Chocobo, or the defeat of Ultima Weapon), Wutai (two sidequests there), and if you're up for it, get Omnislash";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;26-Jul-18 08:03 PM;"For Emerald and Ruby, it's more about your setup, and many of the different strats require you to have a Gold Chocobo";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 01:48 PM;Can I get Omnislash at my level?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 01:49 PM;Yes;;
Perrydice#9311;01-Aug-18 01:52 PM;"You should.  I think you buy it at the Battle Arena, if I am not mistaken. I haven't played through FF7 in a few years..";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 01:53 PM;Battle Arena;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 01:55 PM;"You'll need to do the Battle Arena, in Gold Saucer, for a shit ton of Battle Points. Also. If you leave the area, you'll lose all your Battle Points";;
Perrydice#9311;01-Aug-18 01:56 PM;"Right. It takes time to get the Battle Points, and you gotta be really good in the arena. Sometimes, it's a matter of luck.";;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 02:20 PM;You can cheese the roulette but its only worth cheesing it if you have a Ribbon;;
Perrydice#9311;01-Aug-18 04:14 PM;"@pokemongenius#1474 Yeah, I cheese it too.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:48 PM;I have a ribbon.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:49 PM;"And I’ll have a ziedrich, ultima weapon, and whatever spells and summons I need (except for the super endgame stuff like Kotr)";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:50 PM;I also want the w-summon so I can cast bahamut zero twice in a row and laugh my way through the end of the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:53 PM;End of the game for me will be Seph;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:57 PM;I have 2x slash now... that shit is fun. Beats mobs in one hit. Game is a lot more fun when you can breeze through the random battles. The assault on midgar was a little rough as mobs had a huge uptick in difficulty. Still not that tough but it took me by surprise that I would have to do a little more than smash the physical attack button.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 04:58 PM;"Level up 2x Cut, and you get 4x Cut";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:58 PM;Yeah. I know. Haha.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:58 PM;I’m trying.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 04:58 PM;The 4x cut is interesting but it selects targets randomly;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 04:58 PM;Unless you only have 1 opponent;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 04:58 PM;I mistakenly had it on a weapon that had no materia upgrading for a while... oops.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:00 PM;"I’ve beaten ultimate weapon twice. The first was part of the story, then ran into him again and he rolled away. How many total times do I need to find/defeat him?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 05:01 PM;"You can find Magic Pots in the final dungeon (one specific room, looks like a swamp). Give them elixirs, and they'll give you insane amount of AP. You can use the W-Item glitch for 99 elixirs.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 05:01 PM;"As for Ultima, I'm not sure how many times, but multiple times";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 05:01 PM;like around/at least 10 times;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 05:01 PM;he's very easy;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:01 PM;10 times???? Jesus.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 05:01 PM;I'm estimating;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:02 PM;"He has 100k HP, yeah? I’m getting about 20k each meeting.... maybe...";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:02 PM;Ugh;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:02 PM;Yeah.  Big guard seems to have trivialized most boss fights for me.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:05 PM;Ok. So amount of times you fight him depends on damage inflicted. 100k total HP.;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 05:07 PM;You'll know its your final time when he's hovering by the Ancient Forest;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:07 PM;Cosmo canyon I thought.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:07 PM;Or is that by Cosmo canyon? I have yet to memorize the map.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:09 PM;It's supposed to be this episode's version of Deathgaze in FF6;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:09 PM;With the huge exception that you can actually see it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:13 PM;Yeah figured that.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:13 PM;Haha true.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:14 PM;So I wanna find and beat that dude tonight and then hit up the battle arena.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:18 PM;"So in the battle arena, I need to first get gp betting on Chocobos. Then I use that gp to fight. Can I just get a bunch of gp and fight in the battle arena until I have enough points for Omnislash? Or do I have to win all rounds?";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:18 PM;And I'm... like... after the 4 and a half mark for editing french Kefka....;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:19 PM;"There is a GP vendor npc, but it's random, otherwise, getting some at the wonder square might be an alternative, I guess?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:19 PM;"In other words, can I lose one of the fights, start over using more GP, but keep the battle points until I have enough?";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:20 PM;"If you lose a fight, all BPs you got in that run will be lost as well";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:20 PM;"If you leave the Battle Square, all BPs cumulated will be lost 😦";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:23 PM;That's one of the most annoying rule of the game;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:39 PM;Wait. So I have to keep winning until I get the needed number of points?? If I lose then I start back at zero?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;01-Aug-18 05:39 PM;"I think so, it's been forever since I did Battle Arena";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 05:40 PM;Well that’s bloody awful.;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:41 PM;"It was always like that, even in the pc/steam remasters";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 05:42 PM;"So you have to come with a bunch of GP, and hope you'll get lucky with the roulettes";;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 05:59 PM;No no you lose BP only if you lose and leave but if you gained BP at any point it doesnt drop to zero until you leave or use it at the shop;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:01 PM;"No, I clearly said the current run you're doing, like you won 3 fights in a row, got 500 BPs, and you lose the 4th battle, then you won't get those 500 BPs";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:02 PM;"But if you got, let's say, 1200 BPs overall, those will stay untouched as long as you don't exit the square";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:02 PM;"the arena, even";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:16 PM;@Baguette Cat#6233 now I’m totally confused between what you said and what @pokemongenius#1474 said. Someone help;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:17 PM;Basically keep saving up BP till you get Omni;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:17 PM;So how do I keep the points? Only by winning the 8 fights?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:17 PM;If I win the first three and then lose the fourth. What happens?;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:18 PM;You lose what you earned in that round;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:18 PM;But keep the points from the first three wins?;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:19 PM;No if ya wanna keep hit quit;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:19 PM;What?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:19 PM;So I can just choose to bank points and stop? I don’t have to go to the next fight/round?;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:19 PM;Basically the arena is a big gambling gauntlet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:20 PM;So basically I can “double down” or quit after each fight?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:20 PM;Not really double;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:20 PM;"When you decide to go onto the next fight, you get a slot machine";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:21 PM;"But if I quit, I have to ante up for another round?";;

Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:23 PM;It gives you a rundown of how much points you get each rounds and depending on the handicap you got;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:23 PM;The points you earn per round is difficulty plus handicap. You get a bonus if you complete the gauntlet;;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:24 PM;The handicap part is at half of the page;;

Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:26 PM;"You'd want to avoid the accessory is broken, though";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:28 PM;"Then no ribbon, yes?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;01-Aug-18 06:29 PM;"If I roll in with 200k in gil, can I just handle this? Money solves all problems, yes?";;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:33 PM;"Just dont break any, breaking armor and accessory is the worst imo you can lose Materia and still easily win. You can reroll the same handicap and not get affected by it twice example being Summon Materia breaking";;
Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:41 PM;"As long as you have your ribbon equipped and no accessory handicap, all other ailments will only alter your model without the bad effects";;

Baguette Cat#6233;01-Aug-18 06:51 PM;Or to put bluntly fuck up your run;;
pokemongenius#1474;01-Aug-18 06:53 PM;Break your materia or aim for status;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;02-Aug-18 08:28 AM;"Celes is better as a char than Terra hate her or not. And killing yourself after you lost the only father you had, the belief of losing someone you loved,  and your planet to a psychotic clown aint making her a dumbass, sounds like a excuse to not like her, but there's more to it. Called depression dude";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;02-Aug-18 08:40 AM;Tbh;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;02-Aug-18 08:40 AM;Never understand why people can't see why she jumped off the cliff XD;;
Malfred#1000;02-Aug-18 08:56 AM;"Very few people understand suicide, even those who've been close to it.";;
Perrydice#9311;02-Aug-18 09:14 AM;"I understood why Celes did that. She lost all hope because she felt that because of what Kefka did, her dreams were destroyed, her lover was gone, and her grandpa died. As such, she lost hope and felt there was no reason to continue any further. Now, Celes is not my favorite character of the game, but I do like her as a character. I prefer Terra over Celes but that's just my opinion.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;02-Aug-18 09:15 AM;That's fine but calling her a dumbass for doing it when she lost almost everything  ain't;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;02-Aug-18 09:15 AM;Nah cid was more of a father to her;;
Perrydice#9311;02-Aug-18 09:16 AM;Perhaps. I just referred as grandpa because that's how she addresses him in the game.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:48 PM;"My best team in VI was Terra, Celes, Relm, Locke.";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:54 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Let's talk about what you do in FF6. You start the game and do the whole sequence up until you fight Kefka in Narshe, which takes about 2-3 hours or less, then you go to the operahouse (you can skip over 3 towns between ), then zuzu, then you fly to the empire go through the magitek factory and escape, then you go through the ancient cave, then you're basically done with the first half of the game";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:54 PM;And like we said everything after that is even faster;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:55 PM;"Yeah, I'll agree VI is linear until the floating continent";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:55 PM;or rather the WoR;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:55 PM;"but if you don't know what you're doing in WoR, you could spend a LONG time finding your friends.";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:55 PM;"Yeah but even then, you don't actually do a whole lot. It all goes by very quick";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:55 PM;Phoenix Cave is so random.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:56 PM;"You start the game, get to banon, get everyone back to narshe, opera house, zuzu, ancient cave, floating continent";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:56 PM;I might be biased or just incorrect since VI was my first (and still only completed FF until i finish the final dungeon in VII)... but it just felt very drawn out in the second half of the game.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:57 PM;"If you skip over the story points, the game is shorter by a lot";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:57 PM;SO many characters to find.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:57 PM;It seems longer bc characters talk and you gain more info between those sections;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:57 PM;"and again, you aren't finding all of them unless you have a guide or take a LOT of hours to search.";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:57 PM;But those are basically the only dungeons from the first half of the game;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:57 PM;"I mean on a second third, or even way higher number playthrough";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;Just saying in general FF6 is the shortest. It has the fewest dungeons that are actually mandatory;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;That's probably a fair point.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;Even if you do the entire world of ruin;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;It's still the shorest amount of dungeons;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;Except for mayble like FF1;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;You go through a lot of dungeons more than once;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;"Floating continent is a long one and, although optional, the fanatics tower is also long";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:58 PM;The figaro cave you go through at least 4 times;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:59 PM;"Ha, pretty much";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:59 PM;I appreciate that they take advantage of that with the treasure chests having better stuff later tho;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 02:59 PM;"But yea, figaro cave is like 3 screens";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 02:59 PM;I also feel like it has more random encounters than VII;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:00 PM;"Bc the world is smaller, it almost has to";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:00 PM;which maybe also is why it seems like it was such a slog at points.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:00 PM;But FF7 is so much longer and bigger you end up fighting more battles over time;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:00 PM;Is it bigger from a world standpoint?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:00 PM;I'll have to go back to VI at some point and mess around again.;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:00 PM;"FF7? Yeah, sure, just from a logical standpoint, you move in squares in FF6";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:01 PM;So there are only so many possible positions you can stand in the whole game;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:01 PM;FF7 you don't move on a grid;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:01 PM;"So a step in FF6 is like a whole square, but a step in FF7 lol";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:01 PM;Sometimes you barely touch the dpad for half a second in ff7 and a battle starts;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:01 PM;Cloud barely has time to lift his foot to take a step;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:02 PM;It checks for random battles that much more often than FF6 does;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:02 PM;If that makes any sense at all;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:02 PM;"Plus, just the scale and scope of FF7 is way bigger";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:03 PM;"Either way, yeah, FF6 is probably the smallest FF game";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:03 PM;I still love it tho;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:04 PM;"If you do something like count square by square each space in FF6, it's a tiny game";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:04 PM;"Even FF6's biggest dungeon isn't that big honestly, it just feels bigger because you explore with 3 characters";;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:05 PM;FF6 used a lot of misdirection to make it's world seem larger than it was;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:05 PM;hold on...;;
TheGreatMax6713#8880;02-Aug-18 03:05 PM;It works so well most people don't notice at all;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:16 PM;VI was my first JRPG or FF game... it was my first turn-based combat game as well. I was so lost.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:16 PM;"Shit, I'm still generally unsure of myself in VII";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:16 PM;I'd like to do either VIII or IX without a guide;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;02-Aug-18 03:17 PM;I've only died twice in VII... once to the Midgar Zolom when I didn't knwo what it was... .just thought it was some little thing crawling around in the swamp... walked right up to it and did not have a good time.;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;03-Aug-18 05:07 AM;Could be improved with different paradigm shift timings and slightly different paradigms;;

Perrydice#9311;03-Aug-18 04:28 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 Kain is pretty cool. I do like Cecil a lot as well and he has one of the best character development moments where he gives up the dark armor and dark sword and becomes a paladin. It is probably the best moment in the game, and it happens about a fifth into the game... and then his character development stops right there. I like the twins, Palom and Porom, a lot.";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Aug-18 02:19 AM;But its complete lack of direction is what makes it feel poor compared to recent productions;;

Navy Teal#0589;07-Aug-18 10:03 AM;"Also, there was a part in her dialogue where the timing plus the tone change made her dialogue a bit awkward";;

Pinecone#6148;07-Aug-18 10:04 AM;"@Navy Teal#0589 nope, not just you, I noticed it right away. The voice actress had to sync her lines with the lip movement so she said her lines really fast";;

Perrydice#9311;07-Aug-18 10:07 AM;"@Pinecone#6148 I agree 12 had the best voice acting of the franchise.  I felt because of the direction, the voice actors were able to show their individual interpretation of how the character should sound like, and it really showed in 12.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Aug-18 10:07 AM;Apparently the one for FFX was looking somewhere else;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Aug-18 10:08 AM;"Outside of a few mispronounced words, FF12 does have great voice acting";;

Perrydice#9311;07-Aug-18 10:09 AM;"Unlike Final Fantasy XIII, where they made Georgia van Cuylenburg to emulate the same sounds for Vanille as the Japanese voice actor did in her interpretation in Japanese.  I just so fundamentally disagree with this approach to voice acting.  It should be how the voice actor individual interprets the character, and not repeating what has already been done exact to a tee.  Her voice didn't sound natural and came off as weird.";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Aug-18 10:10 AM;As much as I love the voice actors in XIII the cast direction and localization I take issue with;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;07-Aug-18 10:11 AM;Especially the latter as it gets worse over the trilogy;;
Pinecone#6148;07-Aug-18 10:11 AM;"Right, honestly the voices in 10 and 13 feel stilted and awkward most of the time. I feel that many assume that a dub has to resemble the original in acting, I don't believe in that principle because people who can't emulate one style shouldn't fit that style. They should fit the style that suits them best";;
Perrydice#9311;07-Aug-18 10:12 AM;"@NijiBashira/虹柱#7292 The talent of Final Fantasy XIII was there. I like Troy Baker as a voice actor. And most of the cast were solid voice actors, but I hated the direction.";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Aug-18 06:32 PM;"Without a proper guide, one wouldn't know there was a Quistis card, where to go to get it, they probably would suck at Triple Triad, and they wouldn't know to mod it to 3 Samantha Souls *and then mod those into  180 Triples*.";;
pokemongenius#1474;07-Aug-18 06:34 PM;Yes this. I knew NOTHING about the trading cards I did understand the rules but i never went out of my way to play every NPC ever i just wanted to fight stuff;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Aug-18 06:34 PM;"And not everyone wants to break the game, especially on their first playthrough";;
pokemongenius#1474;07-Aug-18 06:36 PM;I never intended too but once I learned via the SeeD Tests how to Junction I only naturally got very strong very fast;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Aug-18 06:37 PM;"I always cheat the SeeD Tests, and never bothered with reading 'em";;
pokemongenius#1474;07-Aug-18 06:39 PM;Somewhere in them they teach you about absorbing damage and nulling status thats how I learned how to Junction properly;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Aug-18 06:43 PM;"TBH, breaking the game didn't cross my mind, until I watched HCBailly's LP of the game back in 2010. Ever since then, I always break it.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;07-Aug-18 06:43 PM;Using the same strats he does.;;
pokemongenius#1474;07-Aug-18 06:45 PM;Its funny how the game teaches you how to break it albeit in a side menu that most ppl would ignore but the fact that it does alone just baffles me. It really shows that although they intended you to know they had no way of countering that knowledge.;;
Neon_#1876;08-Aug-18 01:21 AM;Ah. I learned the hard way that Desch saying run away from Bahamut...was not a suggestion;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;08-Aug-18 01:27 AM;lol;;
Perrydice#9311;08-Aug-18 09:15 AM;"I like HCBailly.  I think his humor is kinda dumb but he is pretty knowledgeable about the FF games.  Final Fantasy VIII is really broken and I just find the flaws outweigh the ideas.  I actually like the junctioning system.  I think it is very interesting but the game had an inadequate progression system to complement the junctioning system, so that's why I felt it was broken.  Plus the draw system is extremely frustrating.";;
pokemongenius#1474;08-Aug-18 01:11 PM;"Yeah you summed it up perfectly. It seems Square didnt plan too far ahead in the game to consistently provide a challenge to the players. At most you get that at Disc 1 they intimidate you with T-Rexaur and thats enough for you to realize your not prepared yet for whats to come. , , Problem is these moments dont happen ever again until Disc 2 were a T-Rexaur encounter is forced on you but at that point its not as scary. Trying the same trick twice didnt pan out and it just kinda died from there.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Aug-18 01:18 PM;"So far, only like an hour in, I really like the ideas of VIII. Everyone is talking about breaking it. I’m not trying to break it but I could see me being very powerful before end game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Aug-18 01:18 PM;I just drew a bunch of spells in the first dungeon. It’s kind of repetitive in terms of drawing but it’s simple and could probably lead to some over powered shit.;;
pokemongenius#1474;08-Aug-18 01:25 PM;Yup drawing Water specifically begins the cycle of breaking the game;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Aug-18 05:16 PM;I’ll try to play more tonight. Am I ready for triple triad in Balamb garden at least? Ifrit card looks better than anything I had from that loiterer by the elevator.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;08-Aug-18 05:22 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 my suggestions for Triple Triad, keep Open as your playing rule, and Diff as your trading rule. You should save nearby, before starting a game, cause you're probably gonna wanna save scum (I really hate that term), a lot, especially if you don't want to lose a specific card, or you want to get a specific card. You can spread and abolish rules by starting and quitting out of a game. Which one happens is random., , , As for playing in Balamb Garaden, yes, you can play now. I recommend starting with the guy behind the counter at the gates";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Aug-18 05:46 PM;I don’t know the trading rules yet or how to change them.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Aug-18 05:47 PM;I don’t really want to save scum outside of winning and losing... ha.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;08-Aug-18 05:48 PM;Random is the only rule that sounds really obnoxious.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;08-Aug-18 06:32 PM;"Oh trust me, they can be very obnoxious, especially when stacked.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;08-Aug-18 06:32 PM;And I just said how to change;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;08-Aug-18 06:32 PM;start and cancel;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;08-Aug-18 06:32 PM;keep on doing until you see X rule has Abolished/Spread;;

Mr. Hatesalot#7445;08-Aug-18 11:58 PM;Well this is oddly funny;;
Mr. Hatesalot#7445;08-Aug-18 11:58 PM;Fun fact: Ray Chase refers the impalement scene from the ending as The Rape Scene;;

PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 09:51 AM;only upside- Lots of extra cards to refine;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:04 AM;"Squall's character arc:, , Start's as an anti-social asshole.  He's designed to be unlikable, he gets called out by multiple characters for being an ass.  Slowly over the course of the game we see him forced out of his comfort zone into the role of leader.  He opens up to an unconscious Rinoa about how he only acts like he does because he's scared of forming attachments to people.  We learn through flashbacks that Squall is like this because he lost his sister at an early age (she was taken for plot reasons) and he saw it as her abandoning him.  Over the course of VIII we see Squall overcome his childhood trauma, learn to open up and accept others in his life.  The whole thing is really well done and this is just me glossing over it.";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:04 AM;I will concede Squall isn't the worst character in FF history;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:04 AM;He does have his reasons;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:05 AM;"Squall is good, kinda perhaps too much modern";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:05 AM;He does have a complete arc at the end of the day;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:05 AM;the story still is so convuluted that it really could have been done better.;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:06 AM;"Squall is really unique in his mind, really unique when we compare others heroes";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:06 AM;"all the way till the end of disk 2: fairly straightforward, makes sense. Big bad, take her down.";;

Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:07 AM;It's just that now you know her plan is time travel;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:07 AM;but like....why'd it have to be so complicated?;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:07 AM;"Ultimecia lacks a coherent backstory or motivation, I agree.  You can speculate on a couple possibles ones based off of dialogue but nothing confirmed.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:08 AM;It's not that complicated?;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:08 AM;"Villain is from the future and messing with the past, you need to go to the future to stop her.";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:08 AM;"haven't played 7, but that was pretty straight forward: Planet being destroyed, person trying to destroy it more, he's got backstory, so's that other lady, and a few little bits of lore";;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:09 AM;tbh more we have FF less they're complex;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:10 AM;FFXV was so... simple;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:10 AM;I mean every FF game can be simplified like that.;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:10 AM;"FFX: Big war 1000 years ago, led to creation of Sin, Sin destroys stuff and there's lore with that, we go after sin, bring spria safety, Tidus makes us all cry as he dissapears into the afterlife and high-fives his dad";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:10 AM;VIII isn't that much more complicated;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:10 AM;"FFXIII, that was.....to much lore dumping";;

Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:11 AM;It has a name;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:13 AM;Fabula Nova Crystallis;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:13 AM;Found it;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:13 AM;"VIII though: Oh, sorceress is going to help an evil government. Actually, nevermind, she was possessed by some lady in the future, somehow, who for some reason wants to try and merge all of spacetime together, for reasons, and in order to save the universe and the space time continuum, you have to let her do that, somehow be ok, go kill her, which somehow restores all of it, by using some girl who has made it known you can't change the past, however somehow this lady in the future can and is going to use this girl to hop further back in time to change more of the past, even though we established you can't do that. Then suddenly you are the cause of everything set up in order to make sure you let time get messed up, so that you can fix time getting messed up.";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;"Good game, but it decided to involve time travel";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;That's absurd;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;Anything which include time travel is not really good anyway;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;"Rule number 1 of time travel: the only thing with time travel that makes sense, is the thing without time travel.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;You're oversimplifying other FF games and then drawing out VIII's plot;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;Also Fabula Nova Crystallis is the name of XIII's universe @Antoine#2910;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:14 AM;Well they learned this lesson with XIII-2;;

PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:15 AM;"I mean, I am, but the thing is, I have a million more questions with VIII plot then with the others, because time travel inherently makes things complicated.";;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:15 AM;Im just sad they decided to delete FFXV from Nova universe;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:15 AM;To be clear: Love the game;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:16 AM;Just leaves *So* many questions;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:16 AM;The only real main plot questions are Ultimecia's backstory/motivation and Ellone's powers.;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:16 AM;"Well, my first questions are those";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:17 AM;Ultimecia's plan to compress time to a single point was because she could remake the universe in her image and be a god.  They say this in the game.;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:17 AM;Well you cant really explain the story of someone wo travel into time because... time;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:17 AM;It's just a shortcut;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:18 AM;"You can't change the past in VIII, you're right, it's well established.  Ellone tries and fails to change the past, Squall tries and fails to change the past, and Ultimecia tries and fails to change the past.  VIII's time travel plays with the trope that history is already written and it's all predestination paradox and time loops.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:19 AM;"Ultimecia is trying to change the past, it can't be done, but that doesn't mean she's not going to try.";;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:19 AM;Why is she doing this?;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:19 AM;"but then we got this 'How is everyone back in the correct time period?', 'how does Ultimecia make Ellone's powers somehow work differently?', 'how is time repaired just because she is killed?' 'how much time is considered 'passed' and how do you do literally anything if all of time is happening at once?' 'how are you not running into literally millions of copies of yourself in her manner as you go towards her, since the future where you fight her and the past when you enter are happing simultaneously?' etc.";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:19 AM;*in her manor;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:19 AM;Paradox solved perhaps;;
Antoine#2910;10-Aug-18 10:20 AM;Anyway it's a bad idea to seek logic in time travel;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:21 AM;"Love the game, but why time travel?";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:21 AM;it just is inherently messy;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:24 AM;my last question is 'why does she need ellone?';;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:24 AM;she can already clearly travel her presense into the past;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:24 AM;"why not hop straight to Adel, and then back to her sorceress, and so on?";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:25 AM;"```How is everyone back in the correct time period?```, , Established in game.  The team focuses on each other and their memories to return to the right time.  Laguna tells them this., , ```how does Ultimecia make Ellone's powers somehow work differently?```, , She doesn't.  She just wants Ellone to send her farther back to a previous point.  Ultimecia isn't possessing people in the present using Ellone's powers, but a machine *based* on Ellone's powers.  It's a different device.  This is established in the story., , ```how is time repaired just because she is killed?```, , Because she's no longer casting the spell so it unravels.  She never fully succeeded in her goals or the party wouldn't have been able to kill her., , ```how much time is considered 'passed' and how do you do literally anything if all of time is happening at once?```, , This is a dumb question.  Why does it matter how long it took the party to clear the final dungeon?  Ultimecia compresses all of time into a single point, where only she and the party can survive.  Her because of her magic and power, and the party because of their trust and faith in each other.  This is again explained in the story., , ```how are you not running into literally millions of copies of yourself in her manner as you go towards her, since the future where you fight her and the past when you enter are happing simultaneously?```, , This is such a cherry picking question.  Ultimecia compresses time to a point and the party arrives that that point.  They're not also compressed with time.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:25 AM;"```my last question is 'why does she need ellone?'```, , Because Junction Machine Ellone can't send her back far enough to accomplish her goals.  They say this in game., , ```she can already clearly travel her presense into the past, why not hop straight to Adel, and then back to her sorceress, and so on?```, , Because Adel is sealed away in space, what good would possessing her do?";;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:26 AM;"but Adel isn't by the end, which is why that question is a thing. And when I say 'everyone' i don't mean 'the party' I mean, literally everyone.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:27 AM;Because not everyone was outside of time compression.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:27 AM;Ultimecia possess Adel the moment she's not sealed.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:27 AM;I don't know what your point is.;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:27 AM;"these aren't cherry picked questions either, this is just stuff that the game brings as questions";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:27 AM;And it's almost all resolved in the game;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:29 AM;"Fair enough, I can agree to disagree.";;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:30 AM;A lot of your questions are directly answered in the story.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:30 AM;There's not much room to agree to disagree.;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:31 AM;I can agree to disagree on it being not one of the most complicated stories in the final fantasy series.;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:31 AM;and it being something i consider a fault in a game I otherwise love.;;

Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:33 AM;You can ask questions like that about every FF and make it sound way more complicated than it is;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:33 AM;"Never said your opinion wasn't valid. Yes, there's explanations to alot of it if you read alot of secondary options in the story when questions are able to be asked.";;

Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:34 AM;Cid doesn't tell you what Time Compression is;;
PenBil58#0332;10-Aug-18 10:35 AM;it might have been Edea but it was still a thing at some point where it was a 'clarify this' as a secondary option.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:35 AM;It's not Edea either.;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-Aug-18 10:36 AM;"It's Dr. Odine.  He explains it while going over the briefing on how to defeat Ultimecia, and it's not a clarifying option, it's just something they tell you.";;

pokemongenius#1474;11-Aug-18 03:21 PM;Mother!;;
PenBil58#0332;12-Aug-18 03:18 AM;"If I understand right, Sin was actually a protective shell-like summon used by YuYevon to protect himself, and used to protect Dream Zanarkand (used to distinguish from Zanarkand, as Zanarkand is destroyed and while it appears time travel is involved at first glance, there is no time travel in X). Dream Zanarkand is essentially a giant summon being kept by a ton of people from Zanarkand who volunteered to become faith when they new Zanarkand was going to be destroyed by Bevelle 1000 years prior to X's story. Sin also tends to be around and end up destroying places as they get big, or get to close to Dream Zanarkand, as both an unintentional side effect in some cases, and purposefully in others in order to protect Dream Zanarkand from being discovered and destroyed like the original Zanarkand.";;
PenBil58#0332;12-Aug-18 03:20 AM;"This essentially makes Tidus and all residents of Zanarkand a weird grey area between being real, and being summons.";;

OneFapMan#7495;12-Aug-18 07:06 AM;"Yeah lots of hidden stuff like the rumor about Rikku being an unsent, somewhat proof that points to it is, first: The machina you fight her in blows up right? after its beaten and shes inside it she washes ashore the moonflow with almost no scratches at all so ok we can assume shes fine I guess? then another time she refuses to go into the farplane like Auron does, and what she said I keep things inside which seems like a lame excuse so thats two points to point towards her being unsent, although... then she would've went with Auron at the end of the game but that could be a plothole or somethin.";;
PenBil58#0332;12-Aug-18 11:55 AM;"My favorite thing that is left up in the air with the little info I know is about Lady Yunalesca. Did she fight Sin the first time knowing it was her father to side with Bevelle? Or did she think she could actually defeat it? Or, alternatively, did she perform the final summoning knowing she would die and the summon would be used to make a new Sin, and kept feeding the summoning going on for so many years to help keep Dream Zanarkand protected?";;

Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:13 PM;"I think the story of Final Fantasy IV is kinda stupid, imho. It has really good character moments but they are surrounded by other issues that make it come across as comical at times.";;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:17 PM;"Like the whole story of Cecil giving up the dark sword to become a Paladin because he wants to shed his guilty past through his trials. I think that is one of the best character moments in the game, and I love it. It happens about 1/5 through the game and all of his character development stops right there. After that moment, nothing happens to Cecil as a character.";;

Rakan#1902;22-Aug-18 04:21 PM;permanent;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:22 PM;Cecil is the only permanent member in the game.;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:24 PM;My biggest issue with the game (other than the NA SNES version being incredibly easy) is that they use the fake out trope so much in the game that it loses all impact by the time you finish the game.;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:26 PM;"The one thing I will say about Final Fantasy IV is this: If I have a friend or colleague that asks me, I have never played any Final Fantasy games. Which one should I start with?, I usually recommend to start with Final Fantasy IV (Steam or PSP, either one is good imho). I think it is the best example to teach you the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, it's easy to play, and it does have a story that you can follow.";;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:28 PM;The one advantage of the NA SNES version of FFIV being easy is that there is no mandatory grinding because most of the bosses are a joke.;;
Rakan#1902;22-Aug-18 04:30 PM;"Yes, the story is easy to follow and you don't get lost like the earlier entries.";;
Rakan#1902;22-Aug-18 04:31 PM;and it still has that classic FF feeling;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:31 PM;I agree.;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:31 PM;"Just FYI, I do think FFIV is a very good game.";;

Rakan#1902;22-Aug-18 04:33 PM;they're not the same;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:34 PM;"Because all the Final Fantasy games are different, you should always look at the game for what it is instead of comparing it to your favorite or the one that got you into the series.

Garrus Vakarian#8320;22-Aug-18 04:35 PM;Why isn't everyone like that;;
Perrydice#9311;22-Aug-18 04:37 PM;"I just think that Final Fantasy is a series of video games, so I don't take it personally if someone disagrees with me. I personally hold Final Fantasy I as one of my favorite entries. A lot of people don't like it because of its shortcomings, such as the numerous bugs in the original, but I love it due to nostalgia.

He gasped, seeing Gladio use his greatsword to block the downward swing of an Iron Giant, using one of his hands to support the tip of the blade, pushing back the larger one. , , Grunting at the absolute strength of the metallic warrior, he looked towards the Chosen King, once again giving Noctis the push forward he needed, even if he did act like a brat. “Go! We’ll catch up!” He then managed to press forward on the Daemon, making it stumble forwards, slowly at its magnificent size. Gladio then grabbed the hilt with both of his hands, and spun, striking it effectively. A massive shred was left on its chest, and the Giant roared in pain, clenching its wound. It then fell backwards, putting a hand on its knee to support it, while the other still held on to the cut element of the front of its body. Gladio then stepped back to jump";;

In fact, I think that is the worst FF battle theme among the main FF series games. But majority of my issues were the writing of the story and the gameplay. I don't need a 20 hour tutorial of how to use the battle system. It isn't that complicated. And the writing of the story is really repetitive and there is no subtext because a lot of the characters talk on the nose.  They say the word hero like a billion times in the game, so there's an example of the repetitiousness.";;

I take really big issue with what happens to Aerith. I hate that you end up losing her and can't get her back. And even if you can, the game doesn't account for hacking her in so you don't have updated equipment., , I know that anyone can heal and all of that, but I really love her as a dedicated magic caster and is the only character who's limits are 100% focused on healing and removing statuses";;

Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 05:43 AM;"It just really sucks. I love healing type characters a lot. I also just really like Aerith in general.

assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:38 PM;let me get this straight;;
assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:38 PM;So shuyin actually existed;;
assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:39 PM;But what about tidus;;
assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:39 PM;"I mean, they both look similar, but how come both tidus and shuyin existed";;
assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:40 PM;"I mean, I'm aware that tidus is the dream of the fayth";;
Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 07:43 PM;It's one of the many annoying plot holes in X-2;;
Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 07:45 PM;"Shuyin actually existed during the time of Zanarkand before people went to war with it for its advanced machina abilities. After Zanarkand is destroyed, the people of Zanarkand combine their thoughts and dreams in order to create Tidus in order to fill a purpose.

assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:45 PM;"As much as the gameplay is fine and the dresspheres are a good adition, it fucks with the tone and some elements in X";;

assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:47 PM;"but because of fanservice, they give tidus back";;
assholemon#0823;28-Aug-18 07:47 PM;only if you do 100% though;;

Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 09:04 PM;"I think that VI's unrestrictiveness (I know that's not a word) is done quite well. You don't limit yourself by not using broken combinations or giving everyone bullshit spells. There's plenty of equipment that is powerful on various characters, and each character's special mechanic is generally good enough for them to be viable in various ways";;
Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 09:06 PM;"You're not artificially limiting yourself by not giving everyone strong magic spells. And it allows for a lot of fun variance, like what Fran said where you can make characters things they shouldn't be";;

Marcello#4574;28-Aug-18 09:06 PM;"The only way VI makes characters unique are by their special abilities, which is nice, but you don't always need them";;

Marcello#4574;28-Aug-18 09:07 PM;"It's just too easy to break the game, Kefka wasn't even remotely challenging";;

Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 09:16 PM;"Yes it does? The stats for characters don't level up. Equipment and espers determine stats. Barring equipment, which is temporary, espers always give you a specific amount of stat leveling up. So you just use espers to give you the most stats upon level up for whatever you want., , Unless, of course, you mean having *every* stat be the absolute max. Which VI prevents. But you can also see VI as using espers for perfect stats and the other stats that espers aren't affecting is considered perfect";;

Rasea#1840;28-Aug-18 09:43 PM;FFIV went through all kinds of variations. FFIV JP was the original. Then they lowered the difficulty a bit in the US release (called Final Fantasy II). Which was then lowered again for the PSP release. Which is verifiable by a change in enemy stats and a much lower requirement for levels between the SNES and PSP versions;;

Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:49 PM;"@Luny Requiem#5243 I really like the Cecil becoming a paladin storyline. I think it's probably the best part of the game, storywise, where he is willing to give up the dark sword because he feels guilty about slaughtering many people in the name of his King (or former King).";;
Luny Requiem#5243;29-Aug-18 03:50 PM;Yeah that was where Cecil development as a character just stopped which is stupid;;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:50 PM;Agreed.;;

Luny Requiem#5243;29-Aug-18 03:54 PM;I don’t like how golbez is getting hyped up (I haven’t finished the game yet but I think I’m near the end) and there was one part where golbez was gonna kill cecil but he didn’t and golbez says “what is happening” seems like golbez is getting controlled by the same guy that’s controlling main which I’m not liking cause like golbez is getting hyped the fuck up which is bothering;;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:56 PM;"It's like Golbez is getting ready to kill Cecil and the gang. All the sudden, FuSoYa bops him in the head, has some dialogue, and in a split second, Golbez is like I am no longer evil!";;
Luny Requiem#5243;29-Aug-18 03:56 PM;It’s really weird;;
Luny Requiem#5243;29-Aug-18 03:57 PM;And another part that’s dumb it’s more of a nitpick but golbez was basically killed all he had was his hand then it starts moving Cecil just looks as he steals the crystal;;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:57 PM;That was really dumb.;;
Perrydice#9311;29-Aug-18 03:59 PM;"Everything in FFIV is a fake out. Kain betrays Cecil...twice. But nope, he was mind controlled by Golbez.

It's like, can we all just stop sacrificing ourselves?";;

mrmiffmiff#0666;29-Aug-18 08:58 PM;but the answer is yes the term loli has to do with physical appearance not age;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;29-Aug-18 08:58 PM;that's irrelevant where Rydia is concerned;;

Marcello#4574;31-Aug-18 09:34 AM;"It's not controversial, Aerith is canon and the correct form. This has been confirmed for a long time.";;

Perrydice#9311;31-Aug-18 09:39 AM;"It's a little bit controversial because I prefer Aeris over Aerith because Aerith is the the canonical corrected form, I suppose.

Rasea#1840;03-Sep-18 01:46 AM;Seems like Big Guard is pretty important for New Threat;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Sep-18 01:55 AM;"The problem is I never bothered with ESkill/Blue Magic, so I don't know where to get it.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;03-Sep-18 01:58 AM;And there's no indicator ESkill will be useful/needed with the mod. Well you *could* argue Red starts with ESkill equipped *with* Metra Magic is a hint.;;

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 10:51 PM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 I don't think anyone should hate on a game unless you play it and can give your reasons. I personally don't like XIII because 90% of the game was running through hallways and fighting. It doesn't matter how good your battle system is. If that's one of the very rare ways to interact with a 40+ hour game, it gets boring and a chore to get through. Plus, the story is not good and a lot of the decisions the characters make contradict or go against the overall tone of the scene.";;
Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 10:52 PM;"Plus, unless you read the datalogs, you will not really understand most of the terms that are specific to XIII like fal'Cie and l'Cie and PSICOM.";;

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:26 PM;"I actually like the idea of the junctioning system overall, as a concept. I think it's really cool junctioning spells to your stats. But there's major flaws. First off, you can refine a tent (a cheap healing product) to 10 Curaga spells, the junction to youe HPs and you can go from 500 hps to like 3000 in one shot and pretty much shatter the difficulty of the first two discs.";;

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:30 PM;"@pink materia 🌸#2145 I agree. Final Fantasy II is not a good game, imo. I thought it was a chore getting through the game. I absolutely hate the dungeons.

Only one leads to progress, the rest are trap room doors.";;

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:34 PM;"I think overall that, considering FFII was a Famicom game, that it had a good, engaging beginning that set the world up pretty good, which I think is impressive for a Famicom game.

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:54 PM;Final Fantasy III is more bare bones because you just change your class. You can't bring it a stat a monk knows to a black mage job like in V.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;03-Sep-18 11:55 PM;ahh i see;;
Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:56 PM;"I enjoyed Final Fantasy III overall. It has a few bumps on the road but I enjoyed it. I think the game is well paced and doesn't really require you to do necessary grinding, for the most part. But, there is one point that I don't like, and you'll know what I am talking about if you decide to play it.";;
Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:58 PM;I think that Final Fantasy V is an underrated Final Fantasy game.;;

Perrydice#9311;03-Sep-18 11:59 PM;Likewise.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 12:00 AM;"I thought the humor was kinda funny. It's a light-hearted story, fun, and a little silly at times but the customization is endless and there are some really good strats to get through the game. I don't agree with the reason why Nintendo of America decided to not release the game in the US in the early 90s. It's definitely a challenge but it wasn't that hard.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 12:02 AM;i dont think v was that hard;;

Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 12:08 AM;"I haven't played III much, but I liked what I did play of it. And I liked the job system. I think it's in kind of an odd place, in a way?

pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 12:10 AM;hmmm. interesting;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-Sep-18 06:32 AM;That looks impossible;;
Jordi#6158;04-Sep-18 06:33 AM;I managed to do emerald once but I freak out at ruby;;

Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 06:38 AM;"But that's basically what I did. First thing I did was try out the Demi spam strat with Quadra Magic. Which was doing a lot of damage, but I'd just end up dying to Revenge Stomp. So then I tried KotR spam. Which mostly worked, but I still ended up dying";;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 06:38 AM;"Even with minimal materia, the eye phase kept kicking my ass";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 06:39 AM;"To be fair, the weapons only existed in the International version of VII";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 06:39 AM;Pretty much the same that happened with X and the Dark Aeons;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 06:39 AM;Due to no Big Guard (since the bonuses get removed anyways). Which meant that the combo of Emerald Beam + Revenge Stomp + Materia Storm kept killing me. Not even counting the damage of the eyes;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 06:40 AM;"Honestly, I just think it was designed to be really unfair from the beginning. It already hurts a lot by default, which is fair. But the eye phase is straight unfair. Four of those things + Emerald Beam. And they act so quickly that you basically almost never get a turn during that phase is horsecrap";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 06:41 AM;"With emerald weapon, you set up one party member (not Cloud) with Knights of the Round linked with HP Absorb, and that same character needs W-Item Materia. Cloud has to have the Mime materia. With your one character, use two hero drinks (W-Item lets you use two items in one turn), then Mime it with Cloud. When your other character's turn comes around, use Knights  of the Round, then mime it with Cloud. Then repeat until Emerald Weapon dies. You heal every time you mime KotR.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 06:41 AM;"Bad design, I suppose. They're as badly designed as the Dark Aeons and Penance";;

Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 06:43 AM;Cloud should probably be the only one that survives the fight.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 06:44 AM;"Ultimately, I think you should have to do KotR 8-9 times if done correctly.";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-Sep-18 06:45 AM;What about using Cait Sith;;

Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 06:48 AM;"Meh, I decided to cheat it and beat it that way since it was just blocking me from the plat. I tried for a while to beat it legitimately, but that fight is just so unfair, I'm not going to let it eat away at my sanity. Screw that fight";;

Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 06:51 AM;"Also I'd say the Dark Aeons/Penance are bad design, but in a different way? Like, most people just end up maxing out their stats to the requirements or just completely and obliterating everything. So they don't end up being a challenge., , And FFX's postgame (Omega Ruins not withstanding, as it's actually fun) becomes way too reliant on Auto Potion/Auto Phoenix/Auto Haste/Auto Protect. So it's moreso just... boring and not really challenging. But most fights end up, at least, being a puzzle in some way if you don't brute force them";;

Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 08:31 PM;Final Fantasy V is probably the most underrated Final Fantasy game of the series.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 08:31 PM;Nah that's 2;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 08:31 PM;:tabata:;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-Sep-18 08:31 PM;But no one cares about 2;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;04-Sep-18 08:31 PM;don't you even dare mention 2 again;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 08:31 PM;2;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 08:32 PM;"But yeah, I agree that V is quite underrated";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 08:33 PM;"I convinced a friend to give Final Fantasy V a second chance because he didn't like it the first time he played, but I wonder if it was because he didn't understand how the job system worked.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Sep-18 08:34 PM;I **2** like Final Fantasy **2**;;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Sep-18 08:34 PM;It is just **2** good **2** be **2**rue;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 08:36 PM;"I played the original fan translated Super Famicom version of Final Fantasy V. I thought the translation was pretty good and the customization is really awesome. It was trial and error to beat the game until I found the best strategies, but I overall enjoyed my experience.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 08:37 PM;"Although Exdeath disguising himself as a branch in that one scene was really, really dumb, imho.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 08:43 PM;I think it's fitting of V's goofyness and it's general lightheartedness compared to the rest of the FFs;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 08:52 PM;It was funny because it was sooo stupid. One of the dumbest things I have ever seen.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 08:55 PM;V is underrated as hell;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 09:01 PM;i didnt include x-2 on the list because i didnt really enjoy it that much;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 09:01 PM;and tactics and crisis core are the only spin offs i played;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:02 PM;I personally enjoy X the most because I like every character that isn't Tidus and it's also the most difficult;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 09:03 PM;x can be difficult;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:06 PM;It's the hardest one I've played thus far;;

pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 09:11 PM;i want to play the original FF;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;04-Sep-18 09:11 PM;it looks so fun;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:16 PM;The original Final Fantasy has so much replay value and I think it personally still holds after 30 years.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:17 PM;"I have the original NES cartridge, the PS1 port, the mobile port, Dawn of Souls, and it's on the NES classic.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:18 PM;I find it enjoyable;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:18 PM;I have seen a lot of the criticisms of the original NES version that some YouTubers make that I don't necessarily agree with.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:21 PM;Wuzzat?;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:21 PM;The one criticism I do think is valid is that the game is riddled with bugs and what's weird is that these bugs makes the game a lot harder as opposed to easier.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:26 PM;"@Rasea#1840 One criticism I don't agree with is with the battle system. Let's say I attack one enemy with both my fighter and my thief. And my turn comes around and my fighter kills that enemy, my thief will end up whiffing, and it will say ineffective as a result of that. That really frustrates some people. It really bothers them because they feel they wasted a turn. Now, when I play it, all this did was made me pay attention to the battles more, and it helped me keep an internal bestiary, which I really liked. I never got mad or frustrated of the ineffective attacks because I knew what to attack and who was the primary target to kill with who. If it happened, I was like oh well.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:35 PM;I also really like the Castle of Ordeals side quest. It's one of my favorite moments of video game history when you complete this side quest.;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:36 PM;"I mean, in theory, yeah. It could work like that and ask the player pay attention. But that's an awful lot of effort to ask of the player for every random encounter. I think it's fair to consider it a flaw and re-target. Seeing as re-targeting is a staple of basically every RPG ever since then";;
Thelitedragon#4507;04-Sep-18 09:36 PM;moderators don't need hugs;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 09:37 PM;"Just play the PSP version, it's the best one";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 09:37 PM;"And wrong channel, Joker";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:37 PM;It isn't like you have to remember a super ton. You do enough battles where you'll have a good grasp of how much HP most enemies have.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 09:37 PM;:tabata:;;
Thelitedragon#4507;04-Sep-18 09:38 PM;:tabata:;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:38 PM;"It's more about the concept of the mechanic, Bienfu. :P Not the best version";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:38 PM;"@Marcello#4574 My biggest criticism of the PSP version is it is really easy, but it is a good port. I like the PS1 version the best because it has a lot of the modern conveniences while staying the most faithful to the original.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 09:38 PM;tbh the NES version is more annoying than hard;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:39 PM;And it can be a difficult thing to remember. Especially if most RPGs don't ever ask you that you remember HP values of enemies. I think it'd become a necessary thing in the NES version;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:39 PM;"I generally like the battle system overall. I prefer Final Fantasy games with the ATB system for sure, but I do like the system of the original. What I found annoying are all the bugs because so little of the game worked properly.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:43 PM;But it's high on my list mainly because of nostalgia and the good memories.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:48 PM;"At least Final Fantasy I isn't like Mystic Quest or Final Fantasy IV (NA SNES version), or even Final Fantasy XIII where you just have to rapidly press the A (or X) button to move on.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 09:49 PM;~~to be fair you don't finish XIII with mindless X tapping~~;;
Marcello#4574;04-Sep-18 09:50 PM;"And the no retargeting isn't fun for people who played the other games first, it's just a hassle";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:51 PM;"You can get through a majority of Final Fantasy XIII with a basic setup. You get more rewards by maximizing your staggering and paradigms, but to do the minimum to move on, you don't to put a super ton of effort in your setup until maybe late in the game.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;04-Sep-18 09:57 PM;The only actual roadblocks are Aster Protoflorian and the first two Barthandelus fights;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;04-Sep-18 09:57 PM;And maybe the second Manasvin Warmech fight I guess;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 09:58 PM;I had trouble with most of the esper fights;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:59 PM;"My biggest issue with the battle system is that because running through hallways amd battling is 90% of how you interact with the game, it gets boring doing the same thing over and over again, hence why I said you repeatingly or rapidly press X (because I have the PS3 version) to move on.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Sep-18 09:59 PM;Maybe I will have a change of heart after my second playthrough.;;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Sep-18 11:19 PM;Rapidly press X? I never did that in my playthrough;;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Sep-18 11:20 PM;There was one boss where I had to continuously change paradigms from attack to healing to defense to be able to survive in the fight;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:23 PM;Another issue I have with the fight against Tseng and guards is *they're insanely quick even when slowed*. Like I have the ATB set to Wait *and* Battle Speed the slowest possible *and they're still insainly fast*.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:27 PM;And if they don't silence Cid (who now magically got Bad Breath) *they will Stop him*.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:30 PM;"Oh, and I have to use Dispel on the two guards *before Bad Breath can have an effect*.";;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 11:32 PM;Sounds fun;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:36 PM;"Meaning: For things to go my way I need to: Dispel all, Bad Breath, Cura all *just in case*, haste (to counter their speed), *and Big Guard* up all in seconds. Oh, and Bad Breath *needs* to cause Frog/Mini *and* silence. Bonus points for poison.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:39 PM;I *could* magic up 3 ribbons;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 11:40 PM;Big Guard does Haste by default tho 🤔;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:40 PM;New Threat version replaces Haste with Reflect for some dumb reason;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:41 PM;Meaning I'll need to use Cure2/Cura *before* Big Guard goes off;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:41 PM;*and then use hi-potions for the remainder of the fight*;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 11:41 PM;What;;
Rasea#1840;04-Sep-18 11:41 PM;That is so dumb;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;04-Sep-18 11:45 PM;"My last ditch effort is just to change my spawn location to in the rocket, and just skip the boss all together";;

Jordi#6158;05-Sep-18 11:43 PM;It's just a belt;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:09 AM;"Okay, no. So, I'm now fighting Elena, Rude and Reno. I'm getting massive Tseng flashbacks here.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:15 AM;"Like I really want to recommend New Threat, but this boss fight, and the one with Tseng were/are kicking my ass *so much* it's hard to recommend the mod, *despite* others not having the same issue(s) as me.";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:23 AM;"On the plus side, New Threat has made me want to replay the vanilla game";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:23 AM;so that's something;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:34 AM;"and of course, my controller needs charging";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:35 AM;"Don't really have any PC games installed that doesn't require a controller to play. So, PS4, PS3, Switch, or 3DS?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:35 AM;"Or, a movie?";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 12:48 AM;"Alright, here are *all* of the options: , Radiant Historia, Octopath Traveler, Mario & Rabbids, Isle of Dogs, Kingdom Hearts BBS, Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts 2 Critical Mode, Vampyr, Persona 5, Red Dead Redemption, Ico, Ni No Kuni, Kiki's Delivery Service, Avengers Infinity War, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Power Rangers, Nausicaa, The Iron Giant, Summer Wars, My Neighbor Totoro, Mary And The Witch's Flower, Wolf Children, Batman Mask of the Phantasm, Digimon Adventure Tri Part 5: Coexistence, A Goofy Movie, Deadpool 2";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 01:00 AM;I love A Goofy Movie. Also Octopath Traveler is nice. I love KH2CM 👌;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 01:01 AM;My biggest issue with Octopath is (as far as I know) there's no way to turn off the voices;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 01:01 AM;and I *never* complain about voices;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 01:02 AM;👀;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 01:03 AM;"And of course, as soon as I say that, I check the settings...";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 01:37 AM;I keep on forgetting I have I Am Setsuna on my Switch;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 01:55 AM;My friend hates that game;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:10 AM;Well if your friend hates it then it must truly be awful :P;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:10 AM;Quite :>;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:15 AM;"I can't remember quite why, but I recall him saying something about it having glaring flaws in some way";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:16 AM;"But anywho, got distracted + had to eat. Wanted to mention something about that New Threat thing";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:17 AM;"I've been reading up on it a bit and trying to sort of get an idea of what it's like. Since I have the PS4 version, I can't ever try it out so I can't really speak from experience or anything there";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:17 AM;"As far as I can tell, it seems to be mostly a mod designed to change the entire playing experience of VII";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:18 AM;"There's a difficulty mod (Hard Mode, I think?) which just amps the difficulty and nothing else. New Threat does this too, but indirectly. It aims to have the player use everything at their disposal to deal with fights. Like an actual RPG should";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:18 AM;"But as far as I can tell, there's two big issus with it";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:19 AM;1) Big Guard. I have no idea why it has reflect on it. My best guess is that it's part of have the player approach situations differently. As Big Guard is constantly spammed on every boss fight once you get it because it's so immensely strong. Removing haste lowers your offense while having reflect makes you think about when to use it and prevents you from healing normally;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:20 AM;Though I *think* that White Wind pierces Reflect? So you could probably still use it to heal through Reflect;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:21 AM;2) A big part of use everything against the enemy is stealing. But stealing in VII is a royal pain. It's also slow. And too many enemies just have shitty steals. So having to get specific curatives or battle items (like stuff that silences or blinds or slows or whatever) would require too much work on behalf of the player;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:32 AM;"3) There's too much emphasis on using magic. Want to focus on physical attacks? You *can* but why should you when magic deals more damage? What's this? There's a mechanic where you get SP after every (boss) battle, and after 200, you can buy stat boosts of your choosing, thus making Strength better? Yeah, this is great and all *but magic is still better*.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:34 AM;"No really, I was close to end of disc 2, Cloud and co were dealing 600 damage. Yet, magical attacks, like Comet, were dealing 1,000-2,000 damage. *Despite me boosting their strength*. I *just* uninstalled the mod, and guess what? Cloud and co were dealing 1,000-2,000 damage *physically*.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:36 AM;"Now, the mod creator did say magic focused *isn't* the only way, just the safest. No, it's the only way. All other methods are objectively inferior.";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:36 AM;"I can see how his logic makes sense, in a way";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:36 AM;"Been doing more reading (right now, actually) on new gimmicks and changes and stuff like that. Things that break the game or are really powerful and stuff";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:37 AM;"So evidently summons have status effects on them now? So Added Effect is important, but Added Effect won't work if the status effect didn't exist in the vanilla version";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:37 AM;Which suggests an emphasis on using summons more often;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:39 AM;And magic seems to be really powerful. Demi appears to be designed to deal with flying enemies. So Magic Counter=Gravity ends up insta-killing flying enemies. Also Osmose seems to break a lot of AI scripts as well because they become very dependent on abilities;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:39 AM;"*some* Summons have status effects. Like Shiva has Slow. *However* Mid/late Game, Shiva (at least in my playthrough) dealt like 400 damage. Oh, and *all* summons only have the 1 star, meaning *you can only use them once per battle*. So, you can't just spam 'em.";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:40 AM;Also I read that Cloud seems to be basically hamfisted into being a magic user? So that probably has something to do with it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:40 AM;"Actually, he made Cloud a more all rounded character";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:41 AM;meaning you could put him under any path;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:41 AM;"It also makes sense they'd put so much emphasis on magic. The mod seems to be desigend for people that have played the game 3 times or more. And a thing that a lot of VII players don't like is that most offensive magic is useless, it's really costly, and most battles are just Big Guard + White Wind + Attack";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:42 AM;"Now, going back to the Tseng fight for example: It's him, and two grunts. All three have insane speeds, even before Tseng uses Turk Haste. Just using Slow on all three isn't good enough. *You have to Dispel them first*. They're likely to get 3-5 hits *before you can Dispel even one*.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:43 AM;"Speaking of Big Guard + White Wind + Attack, that's what carried me through all of the boss fights, up until I got Cloud back/Tseng fight. Well, (M)Barrier + Cure2 + Attack";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:43 AM;Bonus for Haste;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:44 AM;"And in vanilla, I never really used magic, outside of Cure/Regen";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:45 AM;"Yeah, that's kind of the issue that the mod aims to fix :P";;
Izwar Vain#5689;06-Sep-18 02:45 AM;I barely use any magic in *any* FF game;;
Izwar Vain#5689;06-Sep-18 02:46 AM;Well except 13;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:46 AM;I remember reading something along the lines from the mod maker being basically `a lot of RPGs easily let you fall into this trap where you do the same things over and over to win and that's what this mod aims to change`;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:46 AM;"And the creator overstepped in trying to balancing Attack and Magic, and made it so you fall into the trap of magic spam.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:48 AM;"And yeah, there were some fights were the loop was always the same: (M)Barrier, Cure2, Cure2, Counter Comet, Counter Attack (both counters from Cloud), Limit, repeat.";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:48 AM;"I think the balance makes sense. Using your example, Attack does 50% the damage of magic. Attack has no cost. Magic requires MP to use and you have to deal with elemental affinities. So having magic be strong makes sense";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:49 AM;Except it's not balanced. It's in favor of magic;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:50 AM;"By trying to solve one issue, the creator, well, created a new problem.";;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:50 AM;Yeah;;
Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 02:50 AM;Though I rather magic be favored because Attack being favored is *immensely boring*;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:52 AM;"New Threat is also perfect for those who've done a billion Challenge Runs for FF7, and know the game's mechanics inside and out, probably better than the creators of the game.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:56 AM;"Issue 4) Some boss fights can last for at least *a half hour*. Yes, it can be sphincter tightening  the entire time, but that's still insane.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 02:59 AM;"At any rate, it's 3AM, I need to go to bed";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;06-Sep-18 03:00 AM;I can *and can't* recommend New Threat.;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 08:07 AM;"I played Final Fantasy VII and just realized I missed getting the Yoshiyuki, but I am pretty close to the Wutai Village so I should be getting a Muramasa soon, which about as much power and has more materia slots.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 08:08 AM;Hard to remember every single little thing to a 45 hour game.;;

Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 08:46 AM;"It just would have been nice to have that extra attack power going into Wutai but I don't need it to get through. Once I finish the side quest and unlock the weapon shop, I can get that other weapon and will be using that. Yoshiyuki is really only useful when your other two party members are down. But by the time I need them down, such as the fights with Emerald and Ruby weapon, I don't need that weapon. I'll be spamming more powerful magic spells, such as KotR.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;06-Sep-18 08:47 AM;Yup true;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;06-Sep-18 08:47 AM;I always use magic spells on both Weapons;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 08:48 AM;I just need to steal some Adaman Bangles and then my characters will have really good defense for a good chunk of the game.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;06-Sep-18 08:52 AM;Adaman Bangles are good;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:00 AM;"Right now, I just got Aeris's level 4 limit break. Probably need to grind to get that limit break because it will really help having that limit break for the Wutai battle and I need to go to the golden saucer to get the Sprint Shoes.";;

Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:22 AM;"Recently, it's been Cloud, Tifa, and Vincent. I think when I get through the saucer and the Wutai Village, I am going to bring back Aeris and use Cid since I just got him.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:24 AM;"FYI, she has always been Aeris to me. I know the canon way is Aerith, and I'm sure they will use that version in the remake, but I don't really like it. I sound like I am saying her name with a lisp if I say Aerith. Also, her name in Japanese is Earasu.  She has been and always will be Aeris to me. It sounds better to me.";;

Rasea#1840;06-Sep-18 09:36 AM;:tabata:;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 09:54 AM;I typically make sure to level Aerith up to 99 in disc 2. That’s how good she is.;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:56 AM;I usually make Cloud level 99 and give him the buster sword because it's way better than the ultima weapon.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 09:56 AM;Also make sure not to wait at the end of the floating continent. Shadow gets really pissed if you do.;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:57 AM;He goes on permanent vacation.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 09:57 AM;He actually turns to the dark side and fights for Kefka. Shadow is actually the final boss.;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:58 AM;And Shadow puts on slave ring on Terra and you have to beat her in her Esper form.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 09:58 AM;Yeah. Tough fight.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 09:59 AM;I just vanish-doom it and call it a day.;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 09:59 AM;"And if she has the gem box, the Returners are screwed. She's just vanish and doom us in one shot.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 10:00 AM;:kefka:;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 10:00 AM;But you can just put Aerith in your party and she pretty much handles everything for you.;;
Perrydice#9311;06-Sep-18 10:01 AM;I'll just change into a samurai with Faris and throw money at the problem. That will help too.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;06-Sep-18 10:01 AM;Somewhat serious question: what kind of animal or animals is Red XIII supposed to be?;;

FireProne#0537;08-Sep-18 02:52 AM;"Well I finally finished II gotta say, the ending wasn't bad. It's just weird that you have to use power ups to kill emperor or else there's no way he can be beaten. That's pretty funny tho because I don't think I used power ups when I beat chaos in the first game, and when I fought sephiorth in vii. So yeah that kind of threw me off but oh well. On to the next game.";;
Perrydice#9311;08-Sep-18 08:05 AM;@FireProne#0537 The Emperor is a joke if you equip the Blood Sword.;;

Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:10 AM;It just occured to me ~~because I'm an idiot~~ that the one genuine female villain in the entire FF universe is Cloud of Darkness and even then her body is only vaguely female and doesn't even get characterised until Dissidia;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:10 AM;That's sad :c;;
Dusk Fall#3670;08-Sep-18 08:10 AM;what about brahne;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:11 AM;No idea who that is;;

Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:13 AM;Ultimecia is female too;;
Leon#9542;08-Sep-18 08:13 AM;antagonist in Revenant Wings is also female;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:14 AM;But she's not the real antagonist;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:14 AM;"...well, she is";;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:14 AM;"I mean, for the purposes of gameplay, sure";;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:14 AM;"Ultimecia is the main antagonist in Final Fantasy VIII. A powerful sorceress, her ultimate goal is to [redacted]";;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:15 AM;Edea is also a female antagonist;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:15 AM;But even the big bad dude isn't the antagonist. The world of FF12 sets up those god thingies (I forget what they're called) to be the antagonists you never get to fight but are the cause for all the terrible stuff;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:15 AM;Not the case in VIII;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:16 AM;y u redact in spoilers;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:16 AM;Because you haven't played that yet;;

Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:16 AM;"Well, for me, I have less than zero interest in FF8";;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:17 AM;Female antagonists tho;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:17 AM;But fair enough;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:18 AM;I know that's why it sucks :c;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:18 AM;"And what I meant by genuine female villain, note the genuine part. Is them being a final boss. Not a side antagonist that's just extremely evil for shallow ass reasons";;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:18 AM;Well;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:18 AM;Ultimecia is the final boss;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:19 AM;I know she is that :P I looked her up;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:19 AM;"I assume that Edea isn't, whoever that is";;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:19 AM;Edea is... different;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:19 AM;If I explain I'd be spoiling things;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:19 AM;Since Ultimecia and Cloud of Darkness are the only two female evils to make it into Dissidia so I assumed they were both the true antagonists of their respective games;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:19 AM;Let's just say Edea is the main antagonist for the most part;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:20 AM;Of course she's also from FF8;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:20 AM;God damnit;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:20 AM;Cloud of Darkness came out of nowhere tbh lmao;;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:20 AM;Just not worse than IX's Necron;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:21 AM;"Well, Cloud of Darkness had a female-esque appearance in FF3, but she was regarded as a monster in the game until Dissidia rolled around and gave her a personality rather than evil monster with anatomically female traits";;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:21 AM;"And I like her, in any case";;
Marcello#4574;08-Sep-18 08:22 AM;If you like villains with anatomically female traits then you're going to love Kuja in IX;;

Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:26 AM;No need to if your backlog is huge :P;;

Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:26 AM;"The story blows (I don't think so, but that's the consensus among everyone who is able to objectively review games) but the gameplay is wonderful";;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 08:27 AM;It's also just really fun to see everyone's different playstyles in a fighting-esque game and to play as the villains;;

Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 09:41 AM;She went from like a 8/10 originally because of all of her funny lines about being obsessed with materia. Then she went down to a 5/10 in her Wutai sidequest until I beat the Pagoda part of it;;
Rasea#1840;08-Sep-18 09:41 AM;Which gave me a 7/10 on it. Then back up to a 8/10-ish with all of her funny bits on the airship with her motion sickness;;

Perrydice#9311;08-Sep-18 10:20 AM;"I can understand why she wanted to steal your party's materia. Yeah it's annoying but luckily, the Wutai side quest is rather short and easy.. but understanding the characters that live in Wutai, it makes sense why she is the way she is.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;11-Sep-18 02:42 PM;My point is that an ultima spell cast from some crazy magical power only KOs you while a sword is what actually can kill you;;

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:03 AM;"Yeah, I was taking care of my lady. She wasn't feeling good so she went to bed early. Once that happened, I was able to work on my video game for two hours. Got some pretty good items and some good materia, such as the Alexander summon.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:18 AM;"That is somewhere on the ice shelf area, yes?";;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:21 AM;"Yep. I did pretty good with the snowboarding mini game, and I had enough time to get the All materia, Added Cut materia, the Safety Bit, and the Alexander summon. I think there was only one item but it's really hard to get that and all the other items I got above are better. I barely made it to the Alexander summon. After like two or three steps after getting the Alexander summon, I fell.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:23 AM;Nice. Glad you got some time to play last night. I tried but failed miserably. I fell asleep before my pregnant wife. Sad.;;

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:26 AM;"Nice. The DS remake, imho, is the best version of Final Fantasy IV. The PSP is a really good version if you are a beginner, but if you are an expert at Final Fantasy, I recommend playing the DS remake.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:28 AM;PSP version is far better a lot more polished;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:28 AM;would never recommend the 3D version unless they remade that one and made it good;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:28 AM;I totally disagree.;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:29 AM;"But I understand that I'm probably a minority because a lot of people really like the PSP version, which I agree is a good version of the game. But I just like the DS version better.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:29 AM;and is so well made that it makes no sense that V and VI turned out how they did;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:29 AM;"Only reasons to play the DS version are bad voice acting, artificially harder game, very low performance and bad (imo) art style";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:30 AM;the funny part about the difficulty is that only the early moments of the DS version is harder;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:30 AM;it levels out like halfway through;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:33 AM;FFVI was my first JRPG and it was overwhelming for a while.;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:33 AM;FF is much more than its difficulty;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:34 AM;"So while the actual battles weren’t exactly difficult, understanding the game, where to go, gear, etc,  are absolutely not easy for casuals.";;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:34 AM;Agreed.;;

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:35 AM;"A casual who doesn't use a guide is not going to know how to maximize every single thing such as certain gears and stuff. The game will guide you on key items to advance the plot, but it does not tell you all the side stuff very well.";;

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:38 AM;I don't agree that games hold your hand. The modern games maybe. I think XIII holds your hand a little bit. You basically have a 20 hour tutorial about how the paradigms and battle system works.;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:43 AM;Honestly;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:43 AM;It's not about being hard;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:43 AM;"Not just my experience, but the experience of many casuals.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:43 AM;If complexity is the same as difficulty for a casual that only means they are too lazy or unable to use more than one neuron;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:44 AM;Haha. That’s borderline insulting.;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:44 AM;The former is far more common;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 09:44 AM;Lazy or just not enough time because they have lives and jobs and other hobbies?;;

Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:47 AM;"Not Fark, though. Fark's cool";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:47 AM;"For the record, the *proper* definition of a casual player is someone that doesn't keep up with games or use guides or any of that. They simply just play games for the fun of it because it's a fun activity for them. Like any other activity they may engage in";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:48 AM;"Casual is __not__ equivalent to bad, stop parroting that berating ass twist of the term";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:48 AM;I don't think anyone used casual as an equivalent to bad;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:49 AM;"Secondly, __difficulty is subjective.__ People like to go oh this is easy, this is difficult, you're bad, etc. That shit is irrelevant. What may be a cakewalk for someone is a steep challenge for another";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:49 AM;Those are called elitists;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:49 AM;To say crap like oh no the FF series is really easy and holds your hand is pure ignorance;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:49 AM;Especially those in the FE community;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:50 AM;"Can't be helped, unfortunately. It's the product of three entirely different types of games being made within the same franchise which caused the division and, of course, toxicity";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:51 AM;"It doesn't really hold your hand, but I can't say it's ever hard either. It does have difficulty spikes, so not usually it will require a guide";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:52 AM;~~Why is your name weird now~~;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:52 AM;"Imo, complexity means a steeper learning curve";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:52 AM;"The difficulty also varies heavily with FF. X being one of the most difficult in the franchise, and of course the easier ones like VII and XV (and to some, XIII)";;

Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:54 AM;"Naturally. On the complexity. It also tends to create artificial difficulty by making things obtuse and thus possibly having the player go screw that noise and function without information, thus increasing the difficulty";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;Bein sounds correct;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;Anyway I had my fair share with elitists before;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;They're really retarded;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;"Well, X has EXP control. Something a lot of RPGs lack. The sphere grid is designed in such a way that you get to choose how powerful your characters are. This means you can make it more difficult even without the challenges";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;"Gen, we're in the middle of a convo here pls don't interrupt";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;I was sharing my experience about the elitists;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;12-Sep-18 09:55 AM;You meanie;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:56 AM;"In addition to that, the game tones down the amount of EXP you get via sphere levels. So unless you do *a lot* of grinding, you won't be above average. In addition to *that*, X lacks natural levels. In most RPGs, you gain 2-5 points in every stat upon level up, and some health. X doesn't do that, so having your stats be way more segmented means the enemies themselves are more difficult";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:56 AM;X also has some of the most powerful bosses in the franchise;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 09:57 AM;"Final Fantasy X is a ton of fun. I think the story overall is stupid but it has a lot of room for character customization, and I think it's really cool. That's my opinion of Final Fantasy X-2, except the story is worse than X.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:57 AM;X has as much character customisation as XIII;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 09:57 AM;"I enjoy the summoner journey story in X. Maybe not the best characters, but I enjoy the concept. And it's one of my favorites";;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 09:58 AM;@Perrydice#9311 I disagree.;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:58 AM;I for once agree with perry;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 09:58 AM;except my description would be a lot more extreme;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:01 AM;"When the majority of the game is just run forward and fight, it doesn't matter how good the customization is... in a 45 hour RPG, that gets boring doing the same thing over and over again. XIII desperately needed something to break up the monotony of repeating the battle system. At least Final Fantasy X, even though the mini-games are some of the worst in the FF franchise, attempts to break up the linearity of run forward and fight, though X has random encounters. I like how they use the camera angles to hide certain treasure to make it worthwhile to check everything. Final Fantasy XIII does a horrible job with hiding treasure. It's pretty much in plain sight and it may be in front of an enemy, which goes back to the run forward and fight complaint.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:02 AM;I don't see how any of that is bad;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:02 AM;The battle system was incredibly fun;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:03 AM;"Not objectively, but maybe for you who plays a lot of RPGs";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:03 AM;XIII was technically my first JRPG and my first FF game;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:04 AM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 but that doesn't make it a bad game;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:04 AM;"@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 True. But I hate the story. I think that the storywriting is really bad and the voice acting job, despite having really good talent, is not very good.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:04 AM;it's not something that they designed with the idea of the player going off the set path and much of the game is filled with cinematics;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:05 AM;oh well I don't think it would've been a good movie but I probably would've enjoyed it as a movie far more;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:06 AM;and what makes it a bad game is because of how restrictive it is and how little world building is done;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:06 AM;I feel like they knew that and tried to hotfix it with the datalog;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:06 AM;"The world building was bad, I'll give you that";;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:06 AM;"I will say this. Final Fantasy XIII is not the worst game. I will give that to Superman 64. I wouldn't consider most Final Fantasy games be overall bad compared to all games overall, except for All the Bravest.";;

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:08 AM;"There's a lot of games that I would prefer XIII over them, but Final Fantasy has some incredibly good games, but out of all the main series Final Fantasy games, XIII is my least favorite and it's for a lot of reasons, but mainly, I don't like the story, I don't like the gameplay, I don't like the characters, and the game absolutely bored the crap out of me. Now, unlike most YouTubers that shit on XIII, I actually can give specific reasons where I think the game deserves the criticism and others where I will defend it.

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:09 AM;"Final Fantasy II deserves a lot of criticism. I like a lot of the concepts... on paper, such as the nature vs. nurture battle system.";;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:10 AM;But the execution is very poor in Final Fantasy II.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:11 AM;all three get shit on a lot;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:11 AM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:11 AM;lol;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:13 AM;"There are things I like about Final Fantasy XV. I think it's better than XIII but I don't think it's a great game. It's very incomplete and I just think that it's pathetic that they worked on this game for so long and this is the result we got. I think it's better to make a complete game and then add post-game side content in the DLCs, not add content to complete a giant mess of a game.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:13 AM;lets be honest;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:13 AM;I can't see anything redeemable in XV aside from the music and the bros;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;has anything they've added to XV improved the game in a relevant way;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;I need to know;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;from what I've heard they just dumped random stuff in;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;"Since launch? A massive amount, yes";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;It doesn't have anything else that is even on par with any other FF game;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;People complained about XIII being linear;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:14 AM;Then you look at XV and see it being one of the worst open world games ever;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:15 AM;"...ok, not one of the worst";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:15 AM;I'll say one thing about that complaint;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:15 AM;since I was around when XIII released;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:15 AM;those people really didn't understand that FF itself and most jrpgs are linear in progression which is fine;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:16 AM;the problem was limitations;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:16 AM;"@Marcello#4574 My problem with XIII is not linearity. I don't think linearity is necessarily a bad thing. I do like games that are more straightforward. But my problem with XIII was how it was paced. It felt like you were going from A to B, and if it had mini-games or puzzles, it would have broken up the monotony of the linearity.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:16 AM;and yes XV is at the bottom of the bucket for OW games;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:16 AM;"From launch:, -Several cutscenes and an alternate ending, -Flying Regalia and off-road Regalia, -Ability to switch characters, -Switching from day and night, -Regalia store & MP3 player (listening to music you bought in the field, -Bestiary and fish/recipe compendiums";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:16 AM;I'd rather have no puzzles at all;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:17 AM;X had terrible puzzles and minigames and that doesn't make it any better than XIII in terms of linearity;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:17 AM;It feels like a less linear game for other reasons;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:17 AM;"My favorite game of all time is Chrono Trigger, and I feel that game is pretty linearity, until the end. Which is fine for me. I like games that are more straightforward compared to a convoluted plot.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:19 AM;again it isn't the linearity that sets them apart;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:19 AM;(also in CT you can skip like half the game and beat the final boss early);;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:20 AM;"@Marcello#4574 If you have a linearity game with only one way of interacting with the game, I don't think it should be 45 hours to complete it. If the game was like 15-20 hours, it would have been a better game overall.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:21 AM;It's linear for about 15 hours;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:21 AM;Which feels like a long tutorial;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:22 AM;I don't agree. It's linear throughout pretty much the entire game.;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:22 AM;When you get to Pulse you have 64 missions to do;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:22 AM;"So if you made the overall game take 15-20 hours to beat, I would have liked it better.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:22 AM;those missions are side though;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:22 AM;And the missions are more fun than the game itself;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:22 AM;and they're all combat related;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:23 AM;"Ok, so you want to talk about side missions";;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:23 AM;"I will give you this, the game does get better at the 20 hour mark or so.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:23 AM;So X is as linear and boring as XIII;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:23 AM;get off the linear part;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:23 AM;lets talk about the restrictions;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;"I don't agree. Now I don't think X is the best game in the FF franchise, I think it's a good game.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;that's what set X and XIII apart;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;the world too;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;X is as restricted as XIII in terms of main content;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;And the side content is garbage;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;I agree that the side content is not good in X.;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;It has a more different side content;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:24 AM;how is it as restrictive as XIII;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:25 AM;"XIII does not let you go back to a previous section in the game, in case you missed something, for the most part. X does.";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:25 AM;But it doesn't mean it's better than not having side content at all;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 10:25 AM;Thanks @Rasea#1840 I had the same reaction as the one you posted in that image earlier.;;

Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:27 AM;I don't have any other version of X.;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:27 AM;They butchered the remaster tbh;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:27 AM;The facial textures and expressions are awful;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:27 AM;It's missing many graphical effects as well;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:28 AM;"they always stood out like that, they just made it worse";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:28 AM;and the game being upscaled made the npcs look worse too because none of them were updated at all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:28 AM;only the main cast;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 10:28 AM;And what makes X-2 so much worse than X in everyone's opinion?;;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:28 AM;See this;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;I know the difference;;
Perrydice#9311;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 The story is awful... but I like the gameplay and customization of X-2. I think X-2 has a fun battle system.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;"like I said, they updated the main cast and no one else";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;so the differences stick out a lot more than they originally did;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;And the main cast update was terrible;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;but the main cast was always set apart;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:29 AM;"and again like I said, they just made it worse";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:30 AM;but it isn't anything worth caring about;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:30 AM;They were just fine;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;12-Sep-18 10:30 AM;Is X-2 ATB or something else?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:30 AM;it's atb;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:30 AM;with the ability to job switch mid fight;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:30 AM;I see Yuna's new face and animations and it hurts how worse they made it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:31 AM;"exaggeration, it's not something I think is a great change but it's so irrelevant that it isn't worth mentioning";;

Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:32 AM;Following your logic;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:32 AM;in that case it isn't;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:32 AM;because the game had an entire graphical overhaul;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:32 AM;X did not;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;The only thing people complain about VI is the new sprite work;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;That's all;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;"Honestly, I don't care for either";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;"like I said, the game had a big change in visual style";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;"@Marcello#4574 ~~Playing DQXI so didn't get to respond to this when you said it~~, FFX backtracking actually has a number of uses. Capturing is one of them. Stealing from enemies is another. Or bribing. Auron's spheres for his overdrive. Any treasure you may have missed for completion reasons";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;compared to X which didn't change that much;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:33 AM;So did X imo;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:34 AM;I consider the face changes a big change;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:34 AM;Especially because the characters lost a lot of their expressions;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:34 AM;they didn't lose any expressions;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:34 AM;it's literally an update to the model;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;It wasn't an update;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;"all of the animations the same, the models are more detailed";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;It was a design change;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;"No, they changed the animations";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;You can check that out;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;It wasn't a design change lol they look almost exactly the same;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:35 AM;...watch the video. It's not the same;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;"It is, again they gave them more detailed models";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;having played through both versions;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;I just noticed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;the design of the characters did not change;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;Why does Yuna's face in the PS2 version look like a fat Tidus's face;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;Yuna still looks like Yuna;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;Ew;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;"So you didn't notice, but they did change";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:36 AM;Thank god that was changed;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:37 AM;Though I'ma ~~slowly~~ load the video and watch it because I'm curious now;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:37 AM;"I can tell where the differences are, but you are claiming they completely redesigned all of the characters which they didn't";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:37 AM;the changes are noticeable but minor;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:38 AM;and certainly are not comparable to VI;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:38 AM;This is a better video;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:38 AM;which redid the art of the entire game;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:38 AM;"And, according to this";;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:38 AM;"```Compared to the PS2, some artistic changes are implemented to the characters. For example, Tidus and Yuna have reshaped faces (which some players feel reduces their facial emotional expressions), Yuna's hair is sometimes darker, Wakka has a more muscular back, etc. While some changes are harmless, some players may dislike some of these aspects. Some texture mods have been made to alleviate this, although the underlying polygonal structures can't be edited.```";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:39 AM;And why are you guys arguing about some expression changes anyways? It seems ultimately irrelevant seeing as I can't imagine anyone that would refuse to play the remasters;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:40 AM;I already said it is irrelevant;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:40 AM;but he claimed the remaster was butchered because of this;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:40 AM;Because Ultima is saying it's just an update;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:40 AM;And I'm saying that following his logic the outcry about VI on Steam is an exaggeration;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:41 AM;you are comparing minor changes to a few characters in a game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;12-Sep-18 10:41 AM;to an entire graphical overhaul;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:42 AM;Ultimately it is irrelevant because I can play both X remaster and VI on Steam;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:42 AM;But the facial downgrade is as worse as the new sprites in VI;;
Marcello#4574;12-Sep-18 10:42 AM;That's my opinion anyway;;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:43 AM;"I don't even get the character model bitching in VI. Like, it's really not a big deal. If people should take issue with anything, it's the fact that everything was brightened on VI instead of having that dark, gloomy look that's more fitting with the events of VI";;
Rasea#1840;12-Sep-18 10:43 AM;"No idea why they did that, but whatevs";;

Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 01:16 PM;"Chocobo Breeding. I already finished Wutai. I do think Wutai is annoying, but it's really short so I don't really mind it that much. I wouldn't consider it that annoying.";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 01:28 PM;"I just don't like Chocobo Breeding because of the RNG elements of catching the right Chocobo, then you have to race to get their classes up. It just takes way too long just to get the Gold Chocobo, and I feel this side quest tacks on like an extra 4-5 extra hours of bullshit.. But you need it to get the materia so you can beat the superbosses with the battles taking hours to beat one boss. And those superbosses can upgrade your materia so you can have clones, such as three Mime Materias, two 4-cut materias and one 2-cut materias.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Sep-18 01:33 PM;I literally don't have the time to bother with chocobo breeding anymore so I use cheat engine to modify a chocobo lol;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 01:34 PM;"I don't use cheats. I get the point, sometimes, but it ain't for me.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;13-Sep-18 01:42 PM;"nah I understand, I've discussed this before but I only use them to simulate things that I could do anyway with enough time, I actually do have the genuine patience to grind, just not the time in my life to do so, and there are too many games to play to take a year to finish one, I don't do things like god mode or something";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Sep-18 01:42 PM;^;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Sep-18 01:43 PM;"And to add to that, I save cheats for after my first playthrough";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;13-Sep-18 02:55 PM;"I don’t like chocobo breeding either. Takes a long ass time but you gotta do it, yeah? @Perrydice#9311";;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 03:07 PM;I probably wouldn't mind if it was like a 30 minute side quest... maybe even an hour. But it's like a 4-5 hour side quest which I feel it just is too long.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Sep-18 03:28 PM;"I wouldn't mind it if you could do it throughout the game, like with IX";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Sep-18 03:29 PM;Break it into bite sized chunks;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 03:33 PM;I like that mini game in Final Fantasy IX. I think it's really cool.;;
Perrydice#9311;13-Sep-18 03:36 PM;"The one mini game I don't like is the card game, Tetra Master. That is, without a doubt, the worst thing about Final Fantasy IX. I also don't really like the Trance system that much either because they did it better with the limit breaks in VII, but those are like the only complaints I have with IX. Otherwise, everything else in the game is generally well executed.";;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-18 06:15 PM;@!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403 I remember you saying that you finished WoFF. You know how far into the game I am? I just got to the part where you meet/rescue Snow;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-18 06:16 PM;Should be about 60%;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;13-Sep-18 06:16 PM;iirc;;
themockingguy#6969;13-Sep-18 06:18 PM;Alright thank you;;
Rasea#1840;13-Sep-18 08:29 PM;"`rescue Snow` For a guy that claims to be a souped up bodyguard that can protect his woman, he sure falls into that `damsel in distress` trope very often";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;13-Sep-18 08:32 PM;I don't even recall Snow being in the game;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;13-Sep-18 09:28 PM;Can confirm Snow is in WoFF;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:12 AM;"As a detractor to playing Final Fantasy VII, I started playing Final Fantasy on my GBA, and got all the way to getting the nitro powder from Pravoka. But since I got the mystic key, I need to go to some places and get some loot from the Marsh Cave.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:35 AM;Yeah. That's where I'm at @Perrydice#9311;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:35 AM;"The western keep is a pretty big dungeon, I can't even remember where the shit it";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:35 AM;*shit is;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:35 AM;and I dont even know if it's worth it;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:38 AM;Uh probably not. I haven't played it in a while. I think it's just money and a few weapons that aren't too worth it probably.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:38 AM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Do you know where to go once you get the nitro powder?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:42 AM;"yeah, i skimmed a guide last night";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:43 AM;trying not to get too much info out of it... but at least where to kinda head;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:44 AM;i still have to loot the marsh cave and western keep;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:45 AM;I still do too.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:47 AM;i meant the marsh cave is big... western keep not as much;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:47 AM;half the things to loot are apparently available in the next town I go to after using the TNT;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:49 AM;marsh cave has a silver armlet though which is pretty solid;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:49 AM;"One of my least favorite things about the original I don't like is the mission of going to the earth cave to get the ruby, then go back to the giant's cave to give the ruby to the giant blocking your way. Then getting the earth rod so you can go further into the earth cave. It's just kinda boring and I feel it's padding, imho.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:50 AM;i kinda read about it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:50 AM;I'm interested to see how obvious (or not) it is that you have to go find something else to continue into the cave;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:51 AM;i think that part is coming up for me so I guess I'll find out soon enough.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:52 AM;I don't hate it by any means but I feel it's padding and I am not really a fan of unnecessary backtracking just to make the game longer than it really is. It's one thing if the story dictates going back to a previous area because of danger or whatever.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:53 AM;this is just length for the sake of length then?;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Pretty much.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Can't wait.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:53 AM;"It just adds maybe like 20-30 extra minutes, imho.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Funny that I'm going to finish this before VIII... maybe I'm just not as into VIII as I think I am;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:54 AM;Or that this is just far more accessible for me given my lifestyle... simple game on my phone that is by my side all the time;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:54 AM;"One of the reasons I don't like Final Fantasy II is the game has a word system that is used to progress the plot, which is not a bad idea because it forces the player to pay attention to the plot instead of going through the motions. And throughout the game, I felt a lot of it was just running back to Hilda and having her talk to progress the plot.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:54 AM;Word system?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:55 AM;"Heh, speaking of returning to a town to speak to someone, I'm glad there's that dancing girl in town to help if I can't figure it out";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:55 AM;Was this dancing girl in the original? or is that just a modern addition to make the game easier?;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:56 AM;"Yeah, Final Fantasy II has a keyword system that you need to use to progress the plot.";;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 09:56 AM;one of the few things i liked about II was the word system. i wanted to see it more expanded;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:57 AM;"Hmm, interesting";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:57 AM;Is the game the same length as FFI?;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:57 AM;"My issue was not the word system, per se. It was the constant back tracking. It was like go talk to this guy. Okay, now go talk to this guy. Okay, now go talk to the original guy. And then talk to one more person. It was like that throughout the game.";;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 09:58 AM;"maybe a little longer, but not significant. i didn't track my times but they felt similar";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:58 AM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 It's about maybe a 15 (20 max) hour game or so. It's not super long but it is longer than the original.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:58 AM;"OK, so a little longer";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:58 AM;I bet I end up putting 15 or so hours into FFI;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:59 AM;I'm up to about 3.5 so far and just finishing the mystic key looting;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:59 AM;So you pretty much have to loot with the mystic key to progress the story;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:59 AM;or loot cornelia castle at the least;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:59 AM;You really just need to loot the castle of cornelia to progress the plot.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 09:59 AM;right;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 09:59 AM;The other stuff is optional.;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 10:00 AM;@Perrydice#9311 i can respect that. i would have liked the option to say words to random NPCs to get more reactions;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:00 AM;i wish i hadn't yet looted the castle and tried going to Duerger first to see what the narrative would be;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:00 AM;and how it would direct you to use the mystic key to loot cornelia;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:01 AM;"@Brion#4623 Right. If they used the word system and you don't necessarily use right keyword, at least you can give a little bit more backstory. It was a perfect opportunity to open that up and would have provided more depth to some of the NPCs. But nope, just ?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:02 AM;haha... somehow I can see an FF game doing that.;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 10:02 AM;Haha I was getting annoyed with ? Especially when i needed some direction AND I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:02 AM;like when you recruit Yuffie in VII. One wrong answer and she peaces out. Would have been more interesting if there was some additional dialogue;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:03 AM;"Yeah, but I like Yuffie.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:03 AM;I don't. Bitch stole my shit and then laughed about it while trying to capture us.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:03 AM;"At least in the date scene with Yuffie in VII, she actually makes a move on Cloud.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:03 AM;After that side quest I didn't use her again out of principle. YOU STAY IN THE AIRSHIP!;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:04 AM;YOU ARE GROUNDED!;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:04 AM;I have barely used Cait Sith in my playthrough.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:04 AM;I haven't used Barret as much as I would like. My plan is to use him more soon.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:04 AM;Same on mine.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:05 AM;Cid and Tifa were my mains;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:05 AM;"I have mainly used Vincent and Yuffie, and used a lot of Tifa.";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:05 AM;I currently have Vincent and Cid in my party because I am grinding to master All materia so I can raise cash for the Chocobo Breeding side quest.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:06 AM;Cid is my favorite character in VII and Tifa was my magic user/summoner;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:06 AM;"Haha, I did not do the breeding quest";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:06 AM;I do like Cid a lot.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:06 AM;and I liked having Tifa in the party because I think it complimented the story;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:08 AM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 I need some really good materia, such as Mime and Knights of the Round, and the only way to access them is to get the Gold Chocobo. There's two ways to get a Gold Chocobo, one is to defeat Ruby Weapon and the other is to breed. Since Ruby Weapon has like 800,000 hp and you need these materias to speed up the fights, I decided to do the Chocobo Breeding.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:09 AM;Yeah I hear you;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:09 AM;I just knew I'd never complete it without losing steam so I just skipped it;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:10 AM;Plus the Chocobo Racing is the best way to raise GP so you can do the battle arena to get Omnislash for Cloud.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:10 AM;did all the other side quests except that one. I also didnt do emerald or ruby;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:27 AM;I wish I could just binge finish this game today;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:36 AM;Lol.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:37 AM;"It's a game where if you play it two hours a day, you should finish it within a week. The modern remakes are not that hard, imho. The original NES was a little more challenging and it took a lot of retries to get through dungeons, but overall I really enjoyed it when I played the original. The reason it's easier on the remakes is because the original had magic spell charges, similar to Dungeons & Dragons, and they were really stingy with the spell charges, so you really had to save your magic. Plus there are only two ways to restore your charges, using a House and staying at an Inn.";;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 10:43 AM;i felt like black mage was really weak later in the game. pretty much was just a FAST bot for my fighter + black belt;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 10:43 AM;i can never remember their evolved class names;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 10:43 AM;knight and master?;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:48 AM;Knight and Master.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:50 AM;"I usually start with Fighter, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage.";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:50 AM;"On my NES new game, I did Fighter, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage. Honestly, on the NES, the Red Mage is one of the best classes in the game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:54 AM;Magic spell charges? Like MP in the later-ish games?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:54 AM;"wait, no, this game has MP";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:54 AM;what the hell are magic spell charges?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:55 AM;I don't know D&D so that comparison is lost on me.;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:56 AM;"So in the original, when you got a cure spell, you only receive a limited amount of charges. It starts with 2 charges, I think, in the original. So until you go level up and go to an inn to heal yourself, you are very limited to how many times you can use level 1 magic or level 2 all the way to level 8.";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 10:57 AM;It's very similar to how they do it in Final Fantasy III except way more stingier.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 10:59 AM;yikes;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:00 AM;The modern games use the MP system so you have an overall maximum amount of overall Magic Points and certain spells cost certain magic points.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:00 AM;So you have MP but not much of it?;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:00 AM;"In the original and Final Fantasy III, every level has a certain amount of magic spell charges.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:00 AM;it wasnt until recently I had enough mp to use spells whenever;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:00 AM;There is no MP in these games.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:00 AM;"wait, does FFI not have MP?";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:01 AM;I could swear I get a higher MP limit when I level up;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:01 AM;or is that just a mobile thing?;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:05 AM;"MP is on the GBA remake, the easy mode of PS1, the PSP and the mobile.";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:05 AM;"In the original, as you level up, you get more maximum spell charges, but it's still not a lot.";;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:09 AM;"Final Fantasy III uses the same magic spell charges system, but it gives you more than enough charges to get through the game.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:49 AM;"FFI on NES and PS1 uses a D&D-like spell slot system, yes";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:50 AM;"truth be told the game works better this way, changing it to MP makes magic way too easy in some ways, , but the later versions are easier regardless";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:52 AM;"`I don't know D&D so that comparison is lost on me.`, , Each spell has a level, You get a certain number of uses of each level of spell before you need to rest, Pretty simple";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:52 AM;Yeah I noticed that the XP is different in my Nes walkthrough versus what I’m playing as well. XP of enemies and what’s gained by me seems to be lower.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;the wizards aren't even proper D&D wizards;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;they're more like D&D sorcerers;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;because they can choose spell on the spot;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;wizards have to prepare each spell beforehand;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;i think it uses a d&d style formula for exp. exp gained = monster exp / living party members;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;"Knowing nothing about D&D, wizards and sorcerers seem like the same thing to me. Ha.";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;they're not;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;yeah and d&d wizards can potentially know every spell in existence;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;I know.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;not in D&D at least;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:53 AM;I’m just speaking from the words;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:54 AM;wizards have the drawback of needing to prepare spells beforehand but they're more powerful in every other way;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:54 AM;Sorcerer sounds like a more powerful wizard in my head.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:54 AM;Sorcerer sounds badass. Wizard sounds like a Harry Potter thing.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:55 AM;"Eh, To me, wizard means Merlin, Can't get more badass than that";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:55 AM;Merlin makes me think of a cartoon. Haha.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:55 AM;makes me think of literally centuries of legends and myths;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;:V;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;Or what’s the name of that Disney movie? I’m drawing a blank even though I think I own it on DVD. With Mickey and the broomsticks...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;I can see the cover.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;that's the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment of Fantasia;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;but that's not Merlin;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;Fantasia! Right.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:56 AM;that's Yen Sid;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 11:57 AM;Final Fantasy on the Famicom has some enemies that are literally straight from Dungeons and Dragons.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:57 AM;Yeah I didn’t think it was Merlin. Just that’s what came to mind.;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 11:57 AM;the wizard enemies in the first dungeon should be renamed totally not mindflayers;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:57 AM;"the only cartoon version of Merlin is the cartoon Sword in the Stone version, which is... not the best portrayal";;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:57 AM;^ lol;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 11:58 AM;wasn't merlin in the 90s show king arthur and the knights of justice?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:58 AM;You guys are making me want to play FFI instead of working.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:58 AM;oh god I didn't know that was a thing;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 11:58 AM;but yes I'd suppose he'd be in anything related to King Arthur;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:59 AM;I vaguely remember that show.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;14-Sep-18 11:59 AM;I think it was on the CW or something like that.;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 11:59 AM;i watched it every saturday morning when it was new;;
Perrydice#9311;14-Sep-18 12:00 PM;Like the Eye sprite on the original Famicom is identical to the Beholder enemy from DnD. They actually had to modify the enemy in Final Fantasy slightly when they translated the game to English because there was no comparison. It was identical.;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 12:00 PM;yep;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 12:00 PM;Beholder was and still is a copyrighted name though;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 12:00 PM;so;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 12:00 PM;even pathfinder doesn't really have a mindflayer or beholder knock off;;
Brion#4623;14-Sep-18 12:00 PM;fear wizards of the coast lawyers;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 12:01 PM;🅱izar🅱s of the 🅱oast;;
mrmiffmiff#0666;14-Sep-18 12:01 PM;that represents how I feel about that company;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 04:16 PM;I guess the only other two ports in the world are right there?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 04:20 PM;Or rather only one undiscovered town left that you can even go to?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 04:20 PM;Was there a world map like this with all the locations in the original NES version?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 04:21 PM;Because FF6 has a more simplistic map than this.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-18 04:35 PM;"I do believe the map in the NES version had all the locations, and as for figuring out where to go next in 1, it's simply as where haven't I been to yet";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 04:48 PM;Is that key to all the FF games? Am I just figuring this out?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-18 04:48 PM;Some of the older FF games. Others are more obvious as to where to go next;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;16-Sep-18 04:49 PM;Another tip is to *talk to everyone*;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 04:49 PM;"Yeah I figured that. But after handling the earth/terra cave, it’s a little vague. I go back to melmond but they don’t have anything new to say.";;

Brion#4623;16-Sep-18 05:56 PM;ff1 had a pretty common tactic of random NPCs saying [some guy] moved west!;;
Brion#4623;16-Sep-18 05:56 PM;"you have no idea who that guy is or why you would want to talk to him, but that's the clue that you need to move in that direction";;
Perrydice#9311;16-Sep-18 05:57 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 Yeah, it can be a just go to where you haven't been. In the original NES version, if you held the B Button and press Select, the map pulls up. A broom at Matoya's cave tells you that you can do that.";;
Perrydice#9311;16-Sep-18 05:58 PM;"After you get the canoe, I would go straight to finishing the Castle of Ordeals (Citadel of Trials?) side quest.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 06:38 PM;"In the mobile, the broom does the same actually.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 06:57 PM;Hmm. Ok.;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 07:02 PM;I’ll eventually play both.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;16-Sep-18 07:02 PM;"I’m looking for the shorter, more linear game.";;

Brion#4623;17-Sep-18 01:18 PM;cid surviving his fall with the bomb in his hand that caved in a huge patch of the planet is one of the dumbest things to happen in the series;;

Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 01:29 PM;I also like the part where Rydia refuses to use her fire spell because it reminds her of her town being massacred by the Fire Ring.;;

Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:01 PM;Oh I thought you were talking about Final Fantasy V.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:01 PM;IV... but I'll take thoughts on V as well;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:01 PM;"This is the PSP version of IV. It's a good port. I personally like the DS version better, but the PSP is a very good port of this game.";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:02 PM;But the DS version is really difficult.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:02 PM;NO DS VERSION! ha;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:02 PM;Probably the hardest Final Fantasy game in the series.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:02 PM;I'm pretty much limited to mobile or Vita... I guess I could figure out how to emulate on my Mac but I'd probably brick my computer and lose all my work docs;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:02 PM;IV in general or the DS version?;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:03 PM;"The DS version of IV. The original NA SNES version is probably the easiest FF game in the series, which is my biggest issue with this version. The PSP version is about average difficult. Probably no harder than most of the FF games.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:03 PM;I think I can handle that (maybe);;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:04 PM;I want to play one of these totally blind (or as blind as possible).;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:04 PM;I totally understand.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:04 PM;"but, as we've discussed, adulting sucks";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:04 PM;"If you get the PSP version of IV, I would say you are good to go.";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:04 PM;Absolutely.;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:05 PM;I have to fit time to work out again because I am gaining weight... so that means I have to cut my gaming time.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:06 PM;"Yeah, my wife has more or less be pregnant for the last 15 months. It's amazing how quickly you can put on weight when you're even around a pregnant person";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:06 PM;"I'm in the process of getting back into the gym as well. I'm not out of shape relatively, but it's pretty bad for me";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:07 PM;I say relatively as in relative to the greater population;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:08 PM;I am slacking on VIII hard because it's complicated enough for me not to just pick it up and play;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:09 PM;I really do like it but I think I have to save it for work travel when I am on flights and such so I can sink some time into it;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:11 PM;"Right. Yeah, the junctioning system in VIII can be complicated. I actually am kinda looking forward to replaying it but I gotta finish VII first. I probably have about maybe 8-9 hours of the game left... I did the chocobo breeding, which took me like 5 hours to complete.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:11 PM;I heard you completed that;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:11 PM;nice;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:11 PM;I also grinded all my limit breaks so I have all the limit breaks of all characters except for Cid.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:12 PM;I'm trying to remember if I did any grinding in VII... I don't think I did;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:12 PM;I just need Cid's level 4 limit break.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:12 PM;I grinded a fuck-ton in VI because I was worried I sucked (which I did). I ended up being way OP for the last dungeon;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:13 PM;Dino forrest for the win;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:13 PM;"Yeah, I was only at like level 35-42 for the final dungeon. I used Terra, Locke, Relm, and Edgar and I was at the right level to beat the 3 statues and kick Kefka's ass.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:13 PM;and then I of course forgot to equip all my OP chars for the final battle... still crushed through it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:13 PM;I was in the mid-60s with my team.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;With all the top-tier gear and spells;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;None of my characters died the whole way up to where I had to replace one of them.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;i beat the ds version of iv and it was hard;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;probably the hardest ff game i have ever played;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;"Same, I didn't have any chars go down until Kefka due to being unequipped";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;@pink materia 🌸#2145 I love the DS version..;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;what makes it so difficult?;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;17-Sep-18 03:14 PM;i love it too @Perrydice#9311;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:15 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 You don't get as much exp. or cash when you complete battles, and the enemies hit harder.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:15 PM;"ah, so somewhat artificial?";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:16 PM;"So like for example, the first boss of the game.. the Dragon Mist hits pretty hard, and if you counter attack when he turns to mist, his ice attack is really strong.";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:17 PM;The Octomammoth was a bitch to beat.;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:18 PM;"@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 In FFVI, in tier 1, Visage is weak against fire, Long Arm is susceptible to Air Anchor (which if it lands, on its next turn it will die in one hit), and I just wail on the Short Arm with Locke (with his Valiant Knife and Offering) and Edgar (with Jump). In tier 2, Machine is susceptible to Doom, Tiger is weak against ice, and I just meteor blasted the other two targets. In tier 3, I just kill Lady as fast as possible to take away the healing ability. I also casted Golem so that way when Rest does his Condemned move, it increases the chance that all my characters will survive. Once I got to Kefka, I just used a Megalixir after Fallen One, Morph with Terra, used Fenrir, and just used level 3 magic spells.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:21 PM;"Word, I don't remember the different tiers to be honest. I just brute-forced the shit out of it with Ultima spells once I had realized I hadn't properly equipped myself. I still have the save point right before the final boss and I'm thinking I want to go back and do it properly just to see how much easier it would have been.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:21 PM;"That said, I already beat it so I don't know if I need to prove to myself that it could have been even easier.";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:22 PM;Yeah.;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:23 PM;I just beat Final Fantasy 1 this weekend on the GBA. I also did it by only using my Knight and I had him unarmed. I just wanted to punch Chaos to beat him.;;
Rasea#1840;17-Sep-18 03:32 PM;@Caius#6568 💕;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:41 PM;"Ha, I tried to play more last night but I'm still in Crescent Lake. I fell asleep so early.";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:41 PM;Did you get the canoe?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:41 PM;I could just about binge through it in one or two nights but that's not gonna happen;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:42 PM;"Nope, literally just standing on the edge of the town.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:42 PM;Reminds me of VII where Cloud was creeping outside Aerith's house for like 2 weeks because I didn't have time to play;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:42 PM;Lol.;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:43 PM;The canoe is in Crescent Lake. All you have to do is talk to one of the guys in the Circle of Sages and he gives you it as a reward for lighting up the first orb.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:44 PM;"Yeah, I've read ahead in my guide a little bit";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:44 PM;"Once you get it, you can do the rest of the game in any order you want. I usually go get the airship right away and then complete the Trials of Bahamut.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:44 PM;Airship? Nice;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:44 PM;Dont tell me where;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:45 PM;I actually havent seen that part yet;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:45 PM;No worries.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:45 PM;I do know it's related to the levistone that I get in some upcoming dungeon. That's all I know so I'm going to try to figure it out from there;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:45 PM;Then I'll get frustrated and consult the guide. Ha;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 03:46 PM;Yeah. I'll just let you surprise yourself.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 03:46 PM;Yeah... we'll see about that;;
Brion#4623;17-Sep-18 04:21 PM;"So far in ff4 ds the only fight I had any trouble with, was golbez in the dwarf castle";;
Brion#4623;17-Sep-18 04:22 PM;Rydia came in with such low max hp that keeping her alive for even 2 rounds was a chore;;
Brion#4623;17-Sep-18 04:23 PM;"Definitely noticeably more difficult game overall, just have to be on your toes";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 04:28 PM;Right.;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Sep-18 04:29 PM;It's a game where you can't just breeze over it with rapidly pressing the A button or the X button.;;
Rasea#1840;17-Sep-18 04:29 PM;Playing a game on your toes sounds difficult;;
Caius#6568;17-Sep-18 04:34 PM;Especially if they are webbed;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;17-Sep-18 05:17 PM;Pro tip with the bosses in IVDS: *Use Slow*;;
Rasea#1840;17-Sep-18 05:25 PM;😮 Slow is actually useful in a FF game for once?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;17-Sep-18 05:30 PM;Eeeyup;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;17-Sep-18 05:33 PM;"I'm pretty sure it's useful in at least three games, if we stay on the main series";;
Rasea#1840;17-Sep-18 05:34 PM;Which ones? 🤔;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;17-Sep-18 05:35 PM;IV;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;17-Sep-18 06:05 PM;It was useful in VI.;;

Brion#4623;17-Sep-18 06:55 PM;I never even try status effects on bosses. Guess I should now;;
pokemongenius#1474;17-Sep-18 07:14 PM;Whats the problem;;

Helazionario#8637;17-Sep-18 08:12 PM;And what was Necron?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;17-Sep-18 08:12 PM;We don't really know. There's a theory he's the boss you fight in the Iifa Tree;;
Thelitedragon#4507;17-Sep-18 08:12 PM;lol this is a point of contention;;
Helazionario#8637;17-Sep-18 08:13 PM;"@Psychotic Ninja#0661 Yeah, but that is not explained in a scientific way, I'm dissapointed, 5/10, no explanations and no kiss scene in full hd";;

Perrydice#9311;18-Sep-18 04:05 PM;Zelda 2 is not cryptic. I actually think the game does a pretty good job to tell you where to go.;;

Expanding Storm III#7924;18-Sep-18 04:23 PM;A bad Zelda game hmm;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Sep-18 04:23 PM;"Imo, there is no overall bad Zelda game. Most are really good. Yes, it isn't a perfect franchise (no franchise is) but overall, most of the games, at least the mainline series games, are all awesome. A Link to the Past is one of my favorite games of all time.";;

Perrydice#9311;18-Sep-18 04:28 PM;Games cost $50 back in the day for a shorter game.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;18-Sep-18 04:28 PM;Its reasonable since we didn't care much;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;18-Sep-18 04:28 PM;But now its lazy;;
Perrydice#9311;18-Sep-18 04:29 PM;But to call it a shit game because it's short is not correct in my opinion.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;18-Sep-18 04:29 PM;Nah I said ass because I dont like it;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;18-Sep-18 04:29 PM;So I personally dislike it;;

Rasea#1840;18-Sep-18 04:48 PM;"`Content matters` Your point is irrelevant because games are never priced like that. At most, short games that are high in popularity are $40. And the only real examples I can think of would be something like Deadpool";;

Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:18 AM;Nah VII is the most overrated but X is close;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:21 AM;"I think VII gets so much hate because the compilation is so bad. A lot of people say that Cloud is emo in VII, and I just cannot agree with that assessment whatsoever. I feel Cloud, in the original, was cocky, arrogant, and kind of a jerk. A Han Solo esque character. He wasn't a this world is hopeless kind of guy. He was more like I got this! I am the fucking man, and I'll make enough ruckus for all of us. We will stop Sephiroth and we will do this together.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:22 AM;"But in the compilation material, I agree... he is completely emo and helpless. It's why I don't like Advent Children and just about everything released under the umbrella of the compilation of FFVII.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:24 AM;"@Trickster#9840 What's your list, then?";;
Brion#4623;19-Sep-18 09:24 AM;"yeah i didn't understand why people called him emo, but i've never taken in any of the ff7 media outside of the actual game";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:28 AM;"I feel they call him emo because that's how he acts in Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts. So if someone watched those movies or played KH first before they played the original Final Fantasy VII game, I feel that, because of how Cloud acted in the compilation material, that they already have this expectation that he is emo when they play the original FFVII. So when he has moments where he is questioning his self (which can be construed as emo), they say there it is... he's emo! And I just cannot agree with that. I think it is wrong. Mako poisoning that mind controls you (like MKUltra) is not emo. It's a sickness.";;
Brion#4623;19-Sep-18 09:29 AM;agreed. an actual identity crisis due to basically being poisoned isn't emo;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:29 AM;I think I ruined 7 for myself by playing CC first;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:29 AM;@Brion#4623 Agreed.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:30 AM;"I won't ever argue that he doesn't act emo in Advent Children. He does, and it's one of the biggest reasons why I think AC sucks.";;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:30 AM;Aww I liked it;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:30 AM;I like the action scenes.. but that's about it.;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:30 AM;But it's probably because the other FF film at the time was worse lol;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:31 AM;"Okay, that's fair.";;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:31 AM;Aye the action is good;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:31 AM;Agreed.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:31 AM;AC is better than Spirits Within. Spirits Within is 2 hours wasted from my life. Lol.;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:31 AM;"Okay, going to have to defend AC here";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:31 AM;Go for it.;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:32 AM;But the XV film is just good;;
Brion#4623;19-Sep-18 09:32 AM;i watched spirits within. the best part is that it was so long ago that i barely remember it;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:32 AM;I really enjoyed it anyway;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:32 AM;Got the XV CE so got it on blu ray lul;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:32 AM;"FYI, I don't think that AC is the worst FF film created. It's one of the better ones, but most FF films are garbage.";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:33 AM;"First off, emo needs to stop being misconstrued as a negative term. I get why people may like the stereotype version of it, but it's more than just being annoying and depressing., , Second off, AC is more than just action but Cloud is an annoying emo kid. He's still a badass in the movie. In addition to that, AC also has Cloud dealing with guilt. He feels great remorse for those that died, those he couldn't save. Those he harmed during the early bits of the game when his psyche was fractured. It's him dealing with all of that, and it's a good representation of what war can do to someone's mind";;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:34 AM;:GWdogawooPhotoblob:;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:35 AM;"All of which is understandable, because Cloud is basically used like a ragdoll for most of the game. He has to deal with the fact that he was never allowed to be Tifa's friend because of her shitty other friends. That he was never good enough to be in SOLDIER. His psyche fractured and latched onto Zack's stories, believing that he did all of those things. Then having Sephiroth manipulate him and also learn that he was effectively a failed experiment by a crazy scientist";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:36 AM;That's a lot to put the human brain through and manage to stay intact;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:36 AM;Go on Ras;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:36 AM;Get em;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:36 AM;The fact that Cloud managed to retain his sanity throughout all of that after he had to man up against Sephiroth is nothing short of impressive;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:37 AM;"And yes, that's what happens to a lot of war veterans, especially with psychological damage";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:37 AM;And Cloud has both of those things;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:39 AM;"I don't agree with that. I thought Cloud was weak and just depressed throughout AC. How do you go from confident, cocky... I'm the man! You can count on me to I'm used... I'm washed up. Tifa doesn't like me anymore. Aeris, I miss you! Please let me hold you one more time. How does humankind even matter? We destroy and rebuild so what's the point??";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:41 AM;"He had to man up in the last third of FF7. He didn't have a choice. Tifa helped him, obviously. But AC is set two years after those events. Given that Cloud isn't needed to do anything anymore, he gets to sit alone with his thoughts";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 09:41 AM;It's how PTSD will manifest;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:43 AM;He wasn't weak;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:43 AM;"In FF7, when the tough got going, he pulled his shit together and got it under control. Yes, Tifa helped him put his mind back together because the Mako poisoning fucked up his mind but he had to ultimately find it himself.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:43 AM;He felt weak due to mentally thinking he couldn't save Zack or aerith;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:44 AM;Took Zack to preach to the boy to get him back up in AC;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:44 AM;In cc;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:44 AM;"But it shouldn't have been the majority of the movie, him feeling guilty about Zack or Aerith.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:44 AM;He was weak;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:45 AM;He had no major training yet;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:46 AM;Also;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:46 AM;Um it took near the end for him to receive the jenova cells;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:46 AM;Which is the reason he is noticably strong;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:48 AM;Bruh I miss Zack lmao;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:48 AM;He needs more appearances;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:49 AM;"Secondly, why didn't Cloud live in Costa del Sol in FFVII:AC? You bought the place in the original Final Fantasy VII.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:50 AM;Because plot;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:50 AM;Why didn't cloud help Zack fight off the shinra soldiers?;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:50 AM;Plot;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:51 AM;The I'm too weak shit;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:52 AM;Being real here;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Zack was a last planned char in CC;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Seemed like he was only there to make a impact on Cloud's growth as a char;;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Zack is better Cloud;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 09:53 AM;Yep;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 09:56 AM;"I guess, I don't know. I like Cloud more than Zack. But Zack is a good character.";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 10:00 AM;"Zack is basically written as a better Cloud. Not that he is that to everyone, naturally";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 10:00 AM;"But Zack's character is meant to be this sort of... idol to Cloud. This person that Cloud wants to be like in every way. Zack is strong, skilled, hates corruption and evil and all of that. Not afraid of death";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:00 AM;"Yeah, I can agree with that. Zack is a better version of Cloud.";;
Caius#6568;19-Sep-18 10:03 AM;I like Zack's growth through CC;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:03 AM;So do I.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:03 AM;Crisis Core is the only thing in the compilation material I can tolerate. It's definitely not my favorite but it's fun.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:35 AM;"It's just in Advent Children, for most of the film, he is just giving up and not caring about anything because he feels guilty about the events of FFVII, which why? Aeris doesn't blame Cloud for any of the events in FFVII. It's not his fault she died. None of the crap was his fault and he did what he could. Yeah, he can feel bad about Zack and Aeris's death, which is understandable as part of the grieving process, but they take it to a whole extreme in AC and repeat it to a point where it's annoying.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 10:37 AM;Ik;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 10:37 AM;The main 2 reasons he was like that in ac;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;Is because grieve over Zack and Aerith's death;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;Saying shit like he aint a hero;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;But did they have to beat you over the head with it?;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;No;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;It felt dumb;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;My point exactly.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:38 AM;"Because of the repetitiousness, it became annoying.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 10:39 AM;"I am literally re-watching it again just to see if I missed something with the movie but so far, it's just confirming all the issues I have with the film. Like I said, the action scenes are nice.. but it is such a mess of a movie. And the stupid dream sequences were unnecessary. They served no purpose other than to shoehorn Aeris and Zack into the movie because they are both dead. Honestly, if you got rid of those scenes alone, it would have significantly improved the movie. Not saved it, but made it better. The story still sucked overall.";;
Luneth#8396;19-Sep-18 12:51 PM;do i seriously have to walk all the way back down from the fanatics tower;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Sep-18 12:53 PM;"I don't think so, but if you do, it doesn't take long (if you have the Moogle Charm)";;

Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 01:08 PM;Do you have wall rings on yourself?;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 01:09 PM;"Yeah, Mog would be pretty useful in the Fanatics Tower if your goal is just to get the Gem Box and then walk out.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 01:10 PM;"But, if you need to grind your AP with your magicite, such as Fire 3, Flare and other spells, the Fanatics Tower is like the perfect place to do it because all enemies give you a good amount of AP.";;

Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 02:04 PM;Just annoying how I cant use phantom rush XD;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 02:06 PM;Do you know how to get Phantom Rush (or Bum Rush in the SNES)?;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 02:16 PM;Yep;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 02:16 PM;But;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 02:17 PM;You can't use it in cult tower;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 02:26 PM;Yeah. You can only use magic.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 02:28 PM;"I didn't use Sabin in my Kefka fight. My only issue with Phantom Rush is that you don't get to pick what enemy you want to use the blitz on... however, I think letting it be RNG just made it somewhat challenging. If I could pick, it would have shattered the difficulty of the game, even though I don't think VI is a difficult game.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Sep-18 03:30 PM;Holy crap... I wandered into one of the optional dungeons in FFI;;

Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:22 PM;"The problem with the NES version of FF1 is that the Intelligence stat, that determines all spell power, is bugged. It is fixed rather than improving as you gain intelligence. So in the original, a red mage can use cure, fire, bolt 2, and you do as much damage as a white mage or black mage.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:22 PM;"But a red mage can't learn level 8 magic such as Flare and Holy. Also, it cannot learn Harm (Dia) as well.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:23 PM;The NES version has a ton of bugs.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Sep-18 04:26 PM;apparently;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Sep-18 04:26 PM;I really like the game. I think I'd like to play it again sometime with different classes;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:26 PM;And none of the bugs make the game easier. They make it harder.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Sep-18 04:26 PM;"warrior, thief, WM, RM or something like that";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:27 PM;Whew;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:27 PM;"I have a new game on my NES mini and I did Fighter (Warrior), Blackbelt (Monk), White Mage, Black Mage. I haven't beaten the game using a Monk in the original so why not?";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:27 PM;"Got done venting about why I don't like Lightning in general, but";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:27 PM;I never played ff1;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;My nes is broken;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;I don't like Lightning either.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;I actually don't like any of the characters in XIII except for maybe Sazh.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;She has no personality man;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;Exactly.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;For a char with a weak backstory and a ass Personality;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:28 PM;SE treats her like Cloud;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:29 PM;She doesn't even touch Cloud. At least Cloud is likable.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:29 PM;Ikr;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:29 PM;Yet Lightning gets that much attention;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:29 PM;"3 games, spinoff titles all the shit he has lmao";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:30 PM;Infact she currently has more games;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:30 PM;"And then when she reaches her resolve, I felt like she did a 180, and it felt like it came out of nowhere.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:30 PM;They randomly rewrote her;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:30 PM;It made no sense;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:30 PM;"She gets her clarity, but how do you go from being a complete bitch the whole game to I was so stupid?";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:30 PM;Plot;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:31 PM;Because she got hate back then;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:31 PM;It's very bad storytelling.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:31 PM;They rewrote her personality to be more likeable;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:31 PM;Still ass;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:31 PM;Doesn't connect to her XIII one;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:31 PM;In fact XIII has some of the worst storytelling I have ever seen... the early chapters are fucking brutal how bad it is.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;"For example, they repeat shit over and over again.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;exactly;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;To me;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;Snow is annoying and just stupid;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;"For example, they say the word hero like a billion times in the game.";;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;Hope is whiny af;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;Sach is chill;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;Serah why is she here;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:32 PM;Hope is my least favorite character.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;Sazh*;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;Fang why;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;She is alright but bruh;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;I always get backlash of Hope is just 14. He's acting exactly like his age.;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;She doesn't help that shit plot;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;Hell no he aint;;
Expanding Storm III#7924;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;He whines like a 8 year old;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:33 PM;"Counterargument, Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace is only 8 and he is the worst character in that movie.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:34 PM;I don't care if you are a kid. That doesn't excuse bad storytelling and bad character development.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:36 PM;"Hope would have been likable had they shown the scene where he sees his mother being dropped by Snow exclusively from his point of view and no other. Since the audience already knows that Hope's mom's death is not Snow's fault, I cannot relate to Hope because I already know Snow's side of the coin. Snow did everything in his power to save his mother, and she died anyways.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:36 PM;"If they made that one change, I wouldn't have found Hope annoying because I would have believed that Snow dropped his mother to save his life, for selfish reasons, which is why Hope is pissed at Snow throughout the whole game.";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 04:41 PM;"I mean, I still dislike Hope because I despise whiney characters";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 04:41 PM;But Hope's actions and behavior towards Snow is neither irrational nor unbelievable;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Sep-18 04:42 PM;"My issue with Hope is, Vaan does his arc *much* better";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 04:43 PM;"Losing your mother, especially at 14, is a huge deal. What's the classic thing kids do when they lose a parent? They look for someone to blame it on. Snow is the most logical person to blame for his mother's death and that's what he does";;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 04:43 PM;"Speaking as someone that lost their mother semi-recently, I entirely get Hope's pain in a way I couldn't originally because I hadn't experienced that kind of pain yet";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:44 PM;"I agree, but the problem is the audience already knows both sides of the coin. The story would have suited better if they just gave one point of view and then reconciled it later.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Sep-18 04:45 PM;^;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Sep-18 04:45 PM;"Again, like in XII, where we only know Vaan's/Rek's POV of the event, and we only hear Basch's POV a few hours later";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:45 PM;Right.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:46 PM;You reconcile it later.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:46 PM;"Btw, I love Basch. Basch is awesome in XII.";;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:48 PM;My god I love ff3's boss theme;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;(Not 6 btw);;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;Yeah you're talking NES FF3.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;Mhm;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;I like it too.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;Yeah the boss theme's are great;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;For such a bad final boss cloud of darkness battle theme is great;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:49 PM;My favorite song in FF3 is the buildup to the boss of the game. It's so eerie and creepy and it's awesome.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:50 PM;And I agree... Cloud of Darkness is one of the worst final bosses of any Final Fantasy game.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:50 PM;I also don't really like the Emperor in FF2.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:50 PM;Kefka's fight I don't really like until 3rd phase and up tbh;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:50 PM;I do.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:51 PM;Not that its bad. Its just I'm a oddball;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:51 PM;I think Dancing Mad is Uematsu's magnus opus. That song is so damn epic.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:51 PM;Yeah;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:51 PM;My fav is phase 3 with a close 2nd to phase 4;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:52 PM;Phase 4 is fucking excellent.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:52 PM;"I love the beginning because it sounds metal to me, and I love metal music.";;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:52 PM;another bad final boss (in my book) is ff9's.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:52 PM;But like cloud of darkness there theme is great;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:53 PM;I like Necron though.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:53 PM;But the catch is that there fun to fight;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:53 PM;(Hey you do you mate);;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;Also man;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;Gilgamesh's theme;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;(ff5 version);;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;That's a good song.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;Yeah;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;I think that's my favorite song of FFV.;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;I can't hear you over the sound of Dancing Mad;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;I actually think V is very underrated.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:54 PM;Lol.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:55 PM;I mean your kinda right;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:55 PM;Its (Prolly) not the best game (Would put it in the middle maybe slightly higher). But it def deserves a little more attention;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Sep-18 04:56 PM;Agreed;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:57 PM;But we got to agree;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 04:57 PM;Worst final boss in ff is 10s;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 05:04 PM;Soundtrack or fight? Because both are awesome;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 05:04 PM;fight;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 05:07 PM;I really like that fight;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 05:07 PM;"Not as much as Seymour Flux, but it's still pretty fun";;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 05:07 PM;I think I mean't the last phase or whatever;;
Rasea#1840;19-Sep-18 05:08 PM;"The Yu Yevon phase? Yeah, that's... less so and more of an interactive cutscene";;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 05:09 PM;Mhm;;
KaidenMelon#3452;19-Sep-18 05:09 PM;They can just die with a damn revival items;;
SUCCulent#1704;19-Sep-18 07:29 PM;Best way to fight the final boss is just get Yuna's celestial and get her some of Lulu's late game magic and you're golden.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;19-Sep-18 08:41 PM;Ok. Beat Tiamat. Just the final dungeon to go.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Sep-18 09:08 PM;"Slow down mate, this ain't a race";;

Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 10:24 AM;"Which shouldn't be an issue with Haste/Temper/Giant's Gloves. If your party is magically inclined, however, that can be difficult since Chaos is highly resistant to magic across the board";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:26 AM;I think he has 20k HP in this version.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:26 AM;"And as soon as the battle starts, he goes first and casts some high level magic.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:27 AM;I end up running out of mp and ethers.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:29 AM;I need to use nulall against him next time. And his physical attacks can hit for over 600;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:29 AM;All my guys are level 45;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 10:30 AM;What's your team?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:30 AM;"Warrior, monk, bm, wm";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:30 AM;All class upgraded.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:31 AM;Excalibur on warrior. Ribbons all around. Strong equipment.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:31 AM;All the good spells.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:32 AM;Flare at least does around 450 damage to him.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 10:32 AM;Holy does like 240 or so.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 10:39 AM;Fucking ugh;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 10:39 AM;God damn misinformation;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 10:44 AM;"Okay, so, yeah. 20,000 HP. He follows a pattern., Spells: Blizzaga -> Slowra -> Thundaga -> Curaja -> Haste -> Firaga -> Blizzara -> Flare, Skills: Blaze -> Tsunami -> Cyclone -> Earthquake, , You can use that to know when he'll use Curaja to heal 9,999 HP. I don't know if he alternates between spells & skills, and how often he attacks automatically. You have ribbons on everyone, so you should be able to survive instant death, paralysis (normal attack) and have some good magic defense";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 10:45 AM;"You're using the same team I used, and I managed to beat him. With some difficulty, of course. I can't remember what level I was, though";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:03 AM;I may be overthinking it.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:04 AM;Probably;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:04 AM;"Good equipment with Haste & Temper will deal with him. Most people cite him being a tough fight, but he's definitely doable as long as you can outdamage his Curaja casts";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:04 AM;I’m trying to cast Invis and protect and shit.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:05 AM;How long do temper and haste last?;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:07 AM;"I can't seem to find anything on it, so I assume either several turns (meaning plenty of them) or the whole fight. Or until death, naturally";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:09 AM;"Should be easily tested by going into a random encounter, killing off all but one enemy, and then casting Haste/Temper and seeing how long they last. Whether it be a set amount of seconds or turns";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-18 11:14 AM;There is no duration;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-18 11:14 AM;it is a temporary buff to your actual stats;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;20-Sep-18 11:14 AM;which is why you can spam gauntlet and similar abilities infinitely;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:24 AM;no duration?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:24 AM;so it'll last the entire fight?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:26 AM;im going to try again after a couple work calls.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:27 AM;"Kandori will have to elaborate, but my guesses are one of two things";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:27 AM;"1) They're temporary because they're battle to battle. But they last the entire battle., 2) They're temporary by still having durations on them, but not normal durations because you can stack them instead of refreshing them.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:31 AM;May I chime in?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:31 AM;You're playing which version @Santa Filthy Casual#9506 ?;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:32 AM;"Ah, my bad, you talked about 20k";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:36 AM;really? shit;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:36 AM;so NullAll is full fight too?;;

Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:43 AM;I love that the image there uses a max level party;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:45 AM;That's not a max level party;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:45 AM;My party was barely at 74 and my white and black mages had more hp;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:45 AM;"The chaos ruins are a great place to level up, though";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:46 AM;That party is definitely max level or extremely close to it because you can't reach 999 HP with anyone but Knight. And that's only if you do the class quest as early as possible to capitalize on Knight's increased HP growth;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:46 AM;"If you abuse RNG to its fullest, getting the maximum HP on every level up, you can get something like 1,030 HP at max level";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:47 AM;I promoted them around level 20;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:48 AM;And my knight has been stuck at 999hp since level 69;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:49 AM;Guess they reworked the formulas in the PSP version then;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:49 AM;"Even sooner, level 64 or 65";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 11:49 AM;"You can't compare it to the NES, if that's what you meant";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:51 AM;"Yeah, I evidently was working off FF1 NES formulas for some stupid reason";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:52 AM;"im supposed to cast haste, invis, temper... etc etc... by the time I do that, we'll all be dead";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:52 AM;"I also just assumed that they didn't mess with the formulas between versions. But that'd be silly, since Chaos has 2,000 HP in the NES version but 10x that in the PSP version";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:53 AM;You only need Haste & Temper on your physical units. Protera if you want to defend against the physical attacks. Everything else (skills included) is magical damage and thus lowered by magical defense;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 11:53 AM;Invis tends to be overkill on top of Protera. So it's one or the other;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:54 AM;"so haste and temper cast by BM, protera by WM... then healaga with WM, and flare with BM?";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:54 AM;whats that? I think so...;;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 11:58 AM;how do i spam equipment?;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:01 PM;You just use it as an item in battle for its effect;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:19 PM;"What I usually do is use Giant's Gloves as an item with my warrior and use temper with my ninja, haste with my black mage and use Healaga with my white mage. Once done, I use speed drinks and Tempers and stack them. Once that is done, I use physicals. Usually did 3000-4000 hp of damage per turn.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:19 PM;Chaos was easy after that.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:21 PM;You'd have to replace Ninja with Master since they're not using one;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 12:22 PM;"Temper and Giant's Gloves only work on weapons, the monk and the master don't use any so it's worthless";;

Brion#4623;20-Sep-18 12:47 PM;"same, i knew you were going to say that";;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:47 PM;Everyone does these huge sacrifise themselves moments;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;But they don't stick (except Tellah);;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;Also;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;How many times does Kain betray the party?;;
Brion#4623;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;it really takes away from their heroic deeds (FF2 actually did that right);;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;It got really old after the 3rd time.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;I hate that they use the fake out trope.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;They use it so damn much that it really makes the story stupid.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;Yeah exactly.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;But it's fine because he's edgy;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:48 PM;:tabata:;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;IV has good character moments though.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;I like what tey do with Kain in all the not-IV material he's in like Dissidia.  Where he betrays the party but it's always for some secret greater good motive.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;Not that he was mind controlled... again.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;Like when Cecil gives up the dark sword to shed his skin become a Paladin is awesome.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;Also I thought that Palorum's sacrifice was permanent? Unless I'm forgetting something where they aren't magically stone anymore;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;Yeah IV had good moments.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:49 PM;"Nope, they get unpetrified.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:50 PM;"Huh. It's been a while, so figures";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:50 PM;But Cecil has no character development after becoming a paladin.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:50 PM;"Also unrelated to FF itself, but I like a character in Tales of Xillia that constantly betrays your party because he's getting paid to by a baddie in order to take care of his bed ridden mom since being a good guy doesn't pay well";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Something like that would be neat with Kain;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Rosa has no personality and pretty much serves as a damsel in distress while Cecil saves her. Nothing else.;;
Dinoken2#0946;20-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Yang has no personality and is just there to be an extra body.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Tfw Yang's wife has more personality than Yang;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:51 PM;"Yeah, that's fair.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:52 PM;Why is everyone mind controlled?;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 12:52 PM;Even Golbez;;

Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:52 PM;I assume you meant why in writing and not the story since it's obvious why everyone gets mind controlled in the story;;

Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:57 PM;Rosa's wardrobe is pretty modest in the original art but the remaster gives her a more revealing wardrobe;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 12:57 PM;"And even in the remaster, the only thing revealing about her are the front of her legs since she's wearing that cloth thingy around her waist";;

Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 01:40 PM;"Then keep stacking Tempers on your Warrior with your black mage while repeating everything else with other characters. Once after 5 or 6 rounds of buffing, start attacking with your warrior.";;

Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:03 PM;"If he's doing that much damage, then you either need better equipment or to level more";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:06 PM;He one shotted your White Mage with a Physical?;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:08 PM;Though something is definitely wrong if he's one shotting through Protera;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:08 PM;"Equipment setup, maybe?";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:08 PM;"Also, try moving your Knight to the 4th slot, and have your Master in the 1st, White Mage in the 2nd and Black Mage in 3rd?";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:10 PM;"I mean, the key to surviving the Chaos fight is staying ahead with your HP you lose because Chaos hits and he hits hard.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:11 PM;What would that slot setup be for? Does that affect something?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:12 PM;phew i did it;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:12 PM;Nice.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:12 PM;How did you do it?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:12 PM;hold on lemme enjoy this cut scene;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:12 PM;@Rasea#1840 Most characters generally hit the character in the 1st slot the most frequent so increasing your odds of him not hitting the wrong character is a good idea.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:13 PM;enjoy;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:14 PM;"So if it goes in order of frequency, being 1st -> 2nd -> 3rd -> fourth, wouldn't you want it to be Knight -> Master -> Black Mage -> White Mage respectively?";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 02:14 PM;"In the first FF, no matter the version, the monsters/bosses target the higher character in the column";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 02:14 PM;"But only for 1 target physical attack, and that's not 100%";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:14 PM;"That's generally the idea normally, but if you put your Warrior in the 4th slot in the Chaos fight, he is generally gonna be the one performing the most damage out of the group.";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 02:15 PM;The black mage has the least physical defense;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 02:15 PM;Or wizard;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 02:15 PM;But it's rather close to the white wizard so it doesn't really matter that much;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:18 PM;"Still doesn't make sense to me. Your knight is your tankiest character, boasting the highest combination of health, physical and magical defense. If he needs to, he can even heal himself if your white mage is preoccupied with healing others";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:18 PM;"Master has dick for magical defense, but the slot order refers to physical attacks, so that won't come into play";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:18 PM;But having white mage be #2 seems really risky;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:19 PM;ok. so i was totally overthinking it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:20 PM;i was worried about nullifying and trying to temper his attacks... pun intended;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:20 PM;"but it was as easy as just using giants gloves on warrior right off the bat, surviving his first attack or two so I could get heals up and rolling";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:21 PM;then I just tempered and hasted the master and warrior for the rest of the fight and used healaga every turn regardless of party's HP;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:22 PM;i think i snuck in one flare or two... but my warrior was doing about 2.3k damage so it was better to keep temper stacking on him;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:23 PM;i got an invis in there as well which helped him to not one-shot my peeps;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:23 PM;"but yeah, he hit my warrior for over 700 one time and was able to knock out my BM with one shot too.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:25 PM;that was frusterating;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:26 PM;I had no issues with any of the other fights. That one was fucking rough;;
Brion#4623;20-Sep-18 02:26 PM;sounds like he's much harder than in the NES version;;
Brion#4623;20-Sep-18 02:26 PM;"in NES, i just hasted my knight, master, and red mage and meleed him to death in 3 rounds. if even that many";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:27 PM;"Well, the key to killing Chaos in the NES is to kill him fast before he uses Cur4 which fully heals him.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:27 PM;he does that in this one too;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;"Yeah, Curaja.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;"he heals for 9,999";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;yeah;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;"Except in the original, he only has 2000 hps, so when he uses Cur4, he fully heals every time.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;"but, as you said @Perrydice#9311 , it ended up being a heal race basically";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;Right.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:28 PM;It's all about staying up with your HPs.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:29 PM;yeah... i pretty much healed as often as I could with WM;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:29 PM;she ran out of MP so I had to use some ethers. But it worked.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:29 PM;I think it's better to do that then to use other buffs like Protect and Nul All.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:29 PM;BM used ethers on her once the others were set in terms of buffs;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:30 PM;NulAll also only affects one team member... it's not an all spell;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:30 PM;"Yeah, by the end of the buffs, you can do like 2000-3000 hps of damage.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:30 PM;which took me a second to realize;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:30 PM;I was doing about 2300;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:31 PM;"In my recent playthrough, I decided to be an ass and unarm my Black Mage. What I did was use some Speed Drinks, Giant's Tonic, Sabre with my BM, Temper with my Ninja, and then I was punching Chaos in the face with my black mage for like 2000-3000 hps a turn.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:32 PM;ha;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:32 PM;you could wreck this game with two WM and two warriors;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:33 PM;"or rather a red mage, WM and two warriors";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:33 PM;still need those temper and haste spells;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;I think Ninja outdamages everything in the single-target department endgame;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;"Btw, I was only at like level 50.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;I wasn't 99 or anything like that.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;i almost chose thief over monk;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;i finished the game at level 45;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;That's very good.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:34 PM;"Low, but if you have good strategies, it isn't too difficult.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:35 PM;"Yeah, clearly those strats were lost on me for a whiel";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:35 PM;"Yeah, last night, I surprised one of my best friends because I showed him I beat Emerald Weapon and Ruby Weapon in Final Fantasy VII via Snapchat video.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:41 PM;haha nice;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:41 PM;i skipped them when I played it;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 02:41 PM;i didnt get KoTR so it wasnt happening;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:44 PM;I hated the Chocobo Breeding... but I wanted to beat the Weapons in this playthrough.;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;20-Sep-18 02:48 PM;^^^^^^^;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:49 PM;"Without a doubt, the Chocobo Breeding is my least favorite thing of Final Fantasy VII.. it's not hard necessarily. It's just takes way too long to get what you need.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:50 PM;"But overall, I have enjoyed this playthrough. There are things a I really like about the game and then there are things I don't. There are criticisms I feel are valid and a lot that I don't feel is fair.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:52 PM;">chocobo breeding, Hi, my name is FFX Monster Arena. That's cute";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:52 PM;:tabata:;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:55 PM;"Materia system has a lot of customization, but my issue is that some materia is overpowered and all the customizations make all the characters pretty much the same (except for limit breaks). I feel that VII's equipment is a big step back from how it was in VI. Also, there was pretty much no strategy with weapons except for double and triple materia growth. You generally go with the strongest weapon for the most part. Same with Armor.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:57 PM;"But, for a beginner, it has enough customization to make it complex, but the equipment setup is simple so you don't get confused. So it is definitely a good beginner game.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:57 PM;"I slightly disagree, in a way";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:57 PM;It has one of the best starts of the game by putting you right into the action.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:57 PM;"Like, I enjoy VII's equipment system because normally, the only way to create a tier list, so to speak, is to compare stats";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:57 PM;So equipment in RPGs is genreally pick the one with the highest stats;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:58 PM;Not all the time.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:58 PM;But VII changed that with x2/x3 materia growth and materia slots vs stats;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 02:58 PM;"Any equipment with special effects is usually not worth using later on. If it is, then it's used as a battle item and not something you equip for a beneficial effect";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 02:59 PM;"There are some areas in RPGs where it's more beneficial to use an elemental weapon because monsters are weak to that particular element in the dungeons you are at, even if the weapon or armor is not your best option.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:01 PM;"Here's another example, in VI, there is no doubt that stat wise, the Illumina Weapon or the Atma Weapon was your best weapon in the game. However, the Valiant Knife for Locke had lower stats but it was the best weapon for him.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:02 PM;"Fixed Dice for Setzer has shit stats... but, if you roll really good numbers, you are doing tons of damage, so for him, it's more beneficial to equip that weapon.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:04 PM;I'm not saying that it's bad... I'm just saying I feel it's a step down from VI.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:04 PM;"But, the characters are very likable (except Cait Sith).";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:04 PM;I have no idea about lategame stuff for VI because I'm still pretty early in WoB;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:04 PM;Oh okay.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:05 PM;But I agree with stuff like elemental weaponry for a specific dungeon. But the issue is that stuff is basically hey it's useful for 20 minutes and then complete garbage;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:05 PM;"Weapons, yeah, that's fair.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:05 PM;"Armor, I don't necessarily agree 100%.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:06 PM;"Some armor obtain in the middle of a game is just as useful... if not, more useful later in the game.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:06 PM;"Oh yeah, armor is a different ball game in most RPGs";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:07 PM;"I can't remember any FF examples, but DQ's best equipment tends to be equipment that reduces damage from various elemental types since spells hit harder in that series than attacks do";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:08 PM;"Yeah. Depends on the game, but I feel with FF games, the physical attacks are always your best option at the later half and end of the game.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:08 PM;FF tends to rely (annoyingly) on doing unfair amounts of damage with physical attacks or assaulting you with status ailments;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:08 PM;Spells are very good early on but tail off towards the end.... except for VI. Magic is vital later in that game.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:09 PM;Could be like Mystic Quest where the final boss has the dumbest weakness ever.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:10 PM;Wuzzat? o.o;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:11 PM;"If you use Cure on the Dark King, it absolutely murders him.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 03:13 PM;"And yeah, I was talking about using armor to guard against elemental stuff, not attacking elementally. Unless I misunderstood something";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:27 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 That's how I finished the GBA version (and the game for the 1st time);;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:27 PM;"2 Warriors, 2 white mages";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:27 PM;Because I had no clue where to promote my classes...;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:28 PM;So I had 2 warriors and 2 white mages around 55 against Chaos;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:28 PM;"🤷 I was.... 11 or 12, and no internet";;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:29 PM;Thought promoting automatically happened once some level reached;;
Baguette Cat#6233;20-Sep-18 03:30 PM;It was a long fight :/;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 03:33 PM;"But, all in all, I really like Final Fantasy VII. I have a greater appreciation for it now than when I did a couple weeks ago when I started my replay.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:17 PM;"@Dusk Fall#3670 The gem in X-2 is I don't like your plan. It sucks. from Yuna. I lmao when I heard that because that is so bad to tell the main bad guy in the game before you fight him. My goodness, is that so fucking lame.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:22 PM;At least she's honest.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:22 PM;and upfront...;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:22 PM;Good qualities.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:22 PM;OK. I'm done with FFI. I am about to delete it off my phone.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:23 PM;I'm still worked up over that fight.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:25 PM;That line sounds like a 10 year old wrote that.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:26 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 I liked FF1 overall. Among my favorites. Such a great game and I feel Chaos is pretty challenging.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:27 PM;OR it sounds like a line from a cheesy 80's action comedy movie;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:27 PM;Tango & Cash maybe;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:28 PM;Lol.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:28 PM;I was pointing out that line because the overall dialogue and writing of X-2 is really bad.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:28 PM;"The gameplay is super fun, though.";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:29 PM;yeah that's what I've heard;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 04:30 PM;In fact I've heard that line used as an exmaple of the game's dialogue before;;
Leon#9542;20-Sep-18 04:31 PM;"The speech after that line is pretty good, I think";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:31 PM;Not really.;;
Leon#9542;20-Sep-18 04:31 PM;"There's a couple of bits of writing in there that I enjoy, but it is largely surrounded by crap";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:31 PM;It's better but not great.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:31 PM;"@Leon#9542 Okay, that's fair.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:31 PM;Not all of all is bad. It does have some good moments.;;
Leon#9542;20-Sep-18 04:32 PM;"Maybe that speech just seems good to me because it comes right after such a terrible line and is so much better in comparison, haha";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:33 PM;I don't know... it is so bad that I laugh throughout her speech.;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 04:33 PM;"I mean, that's basically what Tidus says when he learns about the Final Summon";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:46 PM;Which isn't super great.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 04:46 PM;"I'll tell you what, when I get to replaying Final Fantasy X, I will see if I missed something with the game.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 04:58 PM;"I honestly think FFX is one of the best games in the series. The story and dialogue are hit & miss, naturally. But I think the concept is really strong and the gameplay (linear journey for an overwheling goal) does well to support it";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 04:58 PM;And also one of the most balanced gameplay systems in the series;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 04:59 PM;If only FF would allow magic to be useful lategame outside of VI :c;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Sep-18 05:01 PM;"My biggest issue is X doesn't get good, not until Operation Mi'ihen, and doesn't get *really great*, not until the death of Seymour/when the cast is on the run.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:03 PM;"Yeah, it's pretty easy and not much happens until Mi'ihen. That's where a bit of difficulty shows its face too";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:03 PM;Though the game gets *really good* once you pick up Rikku mechanically;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:03 PM;Since a big part of FFX (that sets it apart wildly from any other FF) is Steal & items being rather important;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:06 PM;Then once you reach Thunder Plains for equipment abilities. Then again once you're able to give Aeons abilities;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Sep-18 05:08 PM;I never found X to be difficult;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Sep-18 05:08 PM;or increased difficulty;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:09 PM;"Well, it is, objectively. The large monster type starts becoming an actual threat there. The Garudas. Dual Horns on Mi'ihen Highroad as well";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:10 PM;Eventually monsters stop dying in one hit;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:10 PM;Seymour Flux exists;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:11 PM;Yunalesca is a bitch of a fight. Operation Mi'hen's boss is actually a threat as well. Seymour's fight in Macalania also shows more threat than most bosses before him;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:11 PM;Thunder Plains introduces the magic actually kicks your ass now bit which never stops throughout the entire story;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:12 PM;Inside Sin is one of the most difficult areas in a FF game I've ever played;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Sep-18 05:19 PM;"I the only time I have/had trouble is against Seymour Flux and Lady Yunalesca (less so nowadays, but still). As for Macalania Seymour, I just Talk, Cheer 5x, and Tidus and Auron are dealing like 3,000 damage";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:20 PM;~~That's an unrealistic number unless you grinded into oblivion~~;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:20 PM;"And yeah, I don't have trouble with anything there either, but comparing to other FF games where most things are just pathetically easy, FFX remains one of the most difficult";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Sep-18 05:20 PM;"I don't grind, just fight whatever I come across";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 05:43 PM;I take offense to that @Rasea#1840;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 05:46 PM;To what o.o;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 05:48 PM;I was joking;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 05:49 PM;The part about FF being pathetically easy;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;20-Sep-18 05:49 PM;"`That's an unrealistic number unless you grinded into oblivion`, Next time I play X, I'll record my fight against Seymour (assuming I actually remember)";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;20-Sep-18 09:08 PM;She just said that if final fantasy means “in the out hole” that I should just have another beer and sleep on the couch.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:15 PM;My girlfriend gives zero fucks when I finish a game.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:15 PM;"Before me, she actually never heard of Final Fantasy.";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 09:16 PM;My girlfriend cares a lot because she's also a gamer and is 500x more knowledgeable than me about games and the gaming industry;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:16 PM;"Yup, mine is definitely not a gamer.";;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:16 PM;Idek if my girlfriend is even my girlfriend anymore;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:16 PM;I don't even see her that much;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;I lucked out with mine :P;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;might just break it off on good terms and leave that behind;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;The last time I tried that though she got really upset;;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;Though she avoids most RPGs and prefers shooters and stuff so it's not all rainbows and roses;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;You do what ya gotta do.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;She's still really attached to me for some reason;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:17 PM;I'm not quite sure;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:18 PM;I don't exclusively play RPGs. I have other gaming interests but I love RPGs the best.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:18 PM;I'm stuck in a difficult position because I don't particularly want to continue but at the same time I don't want to hurt her feelings;;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:18 PM;"Oh well, everybody knows highschool relationships don't last";;
Thelitedragon#4507;20-Sep-18 09:18 PM;It has been a good 3 year run though;;

Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 09:19 PM;"I play RPGs, JRPGs, TRPGs, ARPGs... 👀";;
Rasea#1840;20-Sep-18 09:19 PM;"Actually, case in point Joker. I have a friend who met his girlfriend in high school. They dated for... six years. He proposed. They got married and had a kid. They're still together";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:20 PM;"I played action/adventure, side scrollers, beat em ups, some sports games (very little), racing games. It is what it is.";;

SUCCulent#1704;20-Sep-18 09:20 PM;We started out long distance too;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:21 PM;"As far as relationships go, if I am not happy, I will communicate and be honest. If it hurts her feelings, that sucks... but at the same time, she should know how I feel.";;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:21 PM;@SUCCulent#1704 I am with my college sweetheart.;;
Perrydice#9311;20-Sep-18 09:22 PM;"And despite me being a gamer, she accepts me for who I am... and that's important to me.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Ok I think I’m gonna like IV. I played about 20 mins this morning and it was fun.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:51 PM;Not much has happened as I’m only now going on this first quest to Mist Valley.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:52 PM;I’m just hoping the random encounter rate isn’t as high as FF1.;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;It's very sporadic. I'm replaying through it now and it gets very random;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;That got a little annoying towards the end.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:53 PM;Which are you replaying?;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Sometimes you'll walk like 30-40 tiles with no encounters. Other times you'll walk 7 tiles with 3-4 battles;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;IV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Any non spoiler tips for me?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 12:54 PM;Playing the PSP version if that matters;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 12:55 PM;"As am I. And uh, nothing much. IV is relatively easy. The only thing of note is that battle items are pretty important since MP drains stupidly fast";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-18 12:56 PM;Slow works on bosses;;
Brion#4623;21-Sep-18 12:56 PM;does rosa have pray in psp version? it's a huge mp saver in DS;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 12:57 PM;"She does, but it fails half the time";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 12:57 PM;DS version ups the success rate;;
Brion#4623;21-Sep-18 12:57 PM;ah ok;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 01:12 PM;Battle items?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 01:12 PM;As in gear I can use as an item in battle a la FF1?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 01:13 PM;(And other Ff games);;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 01:16 PM;"Equipment, yeah";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-18 01:17 PM;And items like Spider Silk;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 01:18 PM;Though mostly the equipment in my experience since those tend to be rather few in number for a while;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 01:18 PM;IV is also a ***really*** big fan of fake walls and hiding items in green bushes;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 01:18 PM;So be sure to look around for those;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-18 01:20 PM;There's a plot specific thing that trips a lot of first timers;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;21-Sep-18 01:25 PM;The bard likes his weed;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 01:25 PM;Final Fantasy III also did fake walls.;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 01:26 PM;The good ol' weed of the whispering variety 👀;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 02:38 PM;I just got past the waterway areas and am now at that castle. Just got bombed. Rough.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 02:40 PM;Yeah I picked up a couple random things in the dungeon. They are items of some sort. Haven’t even looked to see what they are yet;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 02:54 PM;Fake walls? Fuck. Can I miss anything major behind these fake walls. Are they completely hidden and/or random? Any trick to finding them?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 02:54 PM;Mash your face against every wall tile;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 02:55 PM;No;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 02:56 PM;"Also, how do I access the world map? Or does that happen in time?";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 03:01 PM;Try the run button + select;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;21-Sep-18 03:01 PM;That's what it is in FF1;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 03:19 PM;"If you have any experience with 2D FFs, then they're where you expect them to be. In the middle of a wall or walking into a wall between to tiles you can't access. Something like..., [  x  ]  [W], [  c  ]  [W] <== Fake wall, [  x  ]  [W], W = wall, c = Cecil, x = impassable tile/other object";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 03:21 PM;"But as far as I can remember (and my experience so far, as I'm at the Tower of Zot so far), there's othing really missable or important behind fake walls. In most cases, it's consumable battle items (things that cast spells like fire, haste, slow, stop)";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 03:21 PM;"Occasionally, it'll be a piece of a decent/above average piece of equipment. But nothing critical. Most of the good items in the game are bought or found in chests by exploring various paths in dungeons and stuff";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 03:32 PM;Ok good.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 03:32 PM;"In 6, the moogle charm is behind the wall where you get Mog";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 03:35 PM;Wouldn’t have found that without a guide;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 03:36 PM;"Yerp, tends to be that way";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 03:36 PM;Though it's either fake walls in 2D FFs or using objects to hide chests/items physically like in modern FFs;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:13 PM;"I forgot to mention it @Santa Filthy Casual#9506 regarding the map., , So IV doesn't work like most for the world map. They make you spend MP to bring it up. Which is by the white magic spell Sight. It only costs 2MP, but you always have someone in your party capable of casting the spell, so you're never without it";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:14 PM;What the fuck? Really?;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:14 PM;"I actually really like it because for someone like me that forgets locations a lot, it's super useful. You activate it, and it brings up a map. There's a list on the right that shows the location names. You can press X on one of the locations and it gives you an overview of the map with a red marker as your destination";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:14 PM;"Which I prefer massively to something like VII which is here's an overview, have fun remembering names and locations of everything";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:15 PM;So at some point my chars will have a metric fuck ton of mp so it won’t matter I guess.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:15 PM;Burning the MP that is.;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:16 PM;"I'm glad in the remake of Final Fantasy IV, they give you the map.";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:16 PM;Yeah. Ethers are reasonably common. 2MP is a tiny ass amount because pretty much everyone (even Cecil) gets plenty of MP (once that event happens);;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:17 PM;"I remember playing it on the SNES, and until I figured out you can use Sight, I got lost quite a bit when using the airship.";;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:17 PM;"And even barring that, you have a mage with you for most of the game that has Osmose. And barring *that*, tents are really cheap";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:17 PM;And I still ended up beating it in 17 hours. Lol.;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:17 PM;But that's because the SNES version is easy as fuck.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:17 PM;PSP version harder?;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:18 PM;"The PSP version is harder, but it's not hard.";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:18 PM;"Like if you played the original NA SNES version of IV, you will see that it practically holds your hand by giving you so much cash and so much exp points when you fight goblins and lower level monsters.";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:18 PM;And all the bosses are basically a joke.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:20 PM;Interesting. And the DS version is the most difficult?;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:21 PM;This is pretty much how it works;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/492807525465456650/ULUS10560_00002.jpg;

Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:21 PM;@Santa Filthy Casual#9506 The DS version is the most difficult port of Final Fantasy IV.;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:21 PM;"And yeah, the DS is the most difficult";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:22 PM;"In the SNES version, the only really hard bosses are like Evil Wall, and maybe the Computer... and that's like it.";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:22 PM;The boss of the game isn't hard but he doesn't go down in one or two turns. He'll get a lot of his turns in.;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:23 PM;PSP IV would be harder if they didn't puke random encounters at you every  five fucking tiles;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:23 PM;God that's irritating;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:24 PM;They also give a surprising number of experience considering;;

Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 04:24 PM;I have;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;Ha. I noticed a lot of random encounters in the first dungeon;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;"I've beat like... X, XIV, and XV";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;The underground waterway.;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;Oh okay.;;
Rasea#1840;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;It's super annoying for someone that wants a challenge (me) to get multiple levels per dungeon because the game just pukes encounters & EXP at you;;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;I beaten all of the non-MMOs. Some once and others more than once.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;21-Sep-18 04:25 PM;I’m ok with it. It wears on me after a while though.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 04:26 PM;"The MMOs have crazy time investments, so I'm not surprised";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:26 PM;@Rasea#1840 It's worse in the SNES version.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;21-Sep-18 04:26 PM;"They're really good, but I understand that a lot of people just don't have the time";;
Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:26 PM;I ran away a lot just to keep it challenging.;;

Perrydice#9311;21-Sep-18 04:27 PM;"@Thelitedragon#4507 Yeah, I just did a 100% run of FF7 and it took me about 49 hours to finish. That's a lot of time and it took about a month to beat.";;

Izwar Vain#5689;22-Sep-18 10:43 PM;Congrats!;;
peterptron#9077;23-Sep-18 01:10 AM;I'm at the second barthandelus fight in ff xiii 1;;
peterptron#9077;23-Sep-18 01:11 AM;"Is there a secret way I'm supposed to beat him, or do i have to go back and spend 5 hours grinding crystarium?";;
peterptron#9077;23-Sep-18 01:12 AM;"*or mod in 100,000 or so like a loser*";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Sep-18 01:48 AM;You *can* go back and grind CP if you want;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;23-Sep-18 01:48 AM;Barty's mostly just making sure your paradigms are on point tho tbh;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 02:37 AM;"Your paradigms, your team and your tactics";;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 02:43 AM;That fight is so annoying;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 02:43 AM;I get it's supposed to be hard and so;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 02:43 AM;But it took me like 15+ minutes to beat him;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 02:43 AM;After so many tries;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 02:48 AM;What team were you using ?;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:05 AM;"Lightning, Sazh and Vanilla";;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:05 AM;Vanilla*;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:05 AM;I swear;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:05 AM;VANILLE;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:07 AM;I also tried with Hope and Fang in the team but those didn't go well;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:13 AM;"Light/Hope/Fang is without a doubt one of the worst possible teams, and that's especially true for this fight";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:13 AM;"Similarly, Light/Sazh/Vanille is a hard team to use, and that's especially true for this fight";;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 03:16 AM;lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 03:17 AM;What party would you use?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 03:21 AM;I'd argue Light/Hope/Fang is one of the best teams;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 03:22 AM;"They're who I used to beat the game, and I had no trouble";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:26 AM;"Light/Hope/Fang only gets *really* good if you develop them well, and even than only in Chapter 12";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:26 AM;They can be decent in Late Chapter 11 if you know what to get in their crystariums;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:26 AM;"Otherwise, it's a team that lacks so many offensive tools (in fact, almost all of them until Late Chapter 11)";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:27 AM;"It makes fights longer, slower, and in some cases due to this, more dangerous";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:27 AM;Offense is the best defense against most normal enemies;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:27 AM;"What party, Joker...";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:28 AM;I really like using Sazh/Snow/Fang for that fight;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Sep-18 03:28 AM;"But if I'm underleveled, I'll go for Sazh/Snow/Vanille";;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:42 AM;can anyone help me find a song from ff14;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:42 AM;it's a version of shiva's theme but with an acoustic guitar;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:42 AM;"relaxing, same lyrics though";;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 03:44 AM;Oh wow it's almost 3 am;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:48 AM;"nevermind, I found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ge6Q9MaCgs";;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Sep-18 03:48 AM;I only use Lightning/Vanille/Fang because I'm too lazy to bother with others;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 03:49 AM;Harem route;;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Sep-18 03:49 AM;LMAO;;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Sep-18 03:49 AM;Never thought of it that way;;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Sep-18 03:50 AM;But yeah I just don't find the guys appealing;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:51 AM;omg I just realised the shiva theme has let it go in its lyrics;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:52 AM;"Honestly I used Light, Vanilla and Sazh throughout most of the game, also with them to complete it";;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:52 AM;omfg vanilla;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:52 AM;I give up;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:53 AM;it's the same word basically;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:53 AM;don't worry;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 03:53 AM;your phone must like vanilla;;
Garrus Vakarian#8320;23-Sep-18 03:54 AM;It really does;;
Caius#6568;23-Sep-18 04:20 AM;OG Oblivion gets the people going :GWfroggyJerry:;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 04:31 AM;@Garrus Vakarian#8320 I'm eating a yoghurt with mango and vanilla;;
Dusk Fall#3670;23-Sep-18 04:31 AM;it's a German brand so it says mango-vanille;;

KaidenMelon#3452;23-Sep-18 05:51 AM;I love how in ff3;;
KaidenMelon#3452;23-Sep-18 05:51 AM;One of the classes looks like a black mage in pajamas;;
Izwar Vain#5689;23-Sep-18 06:11 AM;You mean black wizard?;;
Brion#4623;23-Sep-18 05:15 PM;i trudged my way through the lunar subterrane just to get absolutely crapped on by zeromus. i think i am a bit underleveled;;
Brion#4623;23-Sep-18 05:15 PM;"i remember he was really easy in snes, not so much on ds apparently";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 05:48 PM;The game expects you to have augments;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 05:48 PM;Otherwise you gotta be near max level;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 05:48 PM;Speaking from experience;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 05:49 PM;What saved me was Kain's Jump;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 06:56 PM;Been getting through some 8 tonight.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 07:02 PM;I should probably start on that too actually;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 07:02 PM;After I finish the homework;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 07:09 PM;"So far, it's been a real chore to get through.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 07:10 PM;And the music isn't helping a whole lot.;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 07:17 PM;PC?;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 07:18 PM;Cant't you mod out the midi music though?;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 07:22 PM;PS1.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 07:35 PM;That draw grinding. Lol;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:21 PM;Draw isn't the only way to get magic;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 08:24 PM;"In fact, drawing is probably the worst way to get magic";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 08:36 PM;You still have to do it to get certain magic.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 08:46 PM;I got to work on Ice Item Refine so I can turn these stones into Blizzaga spells and then Junction it to Strength for Squall.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 08:46 PM;So I have good attack power early on.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 09:09 PM;😦;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;23-Sep-18 09:09 PM;Chore to get through?;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 09:15 PM;Not super fun to get through... like doing chores.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 09:15 PM;"I think the game is super slow early on so maybe it will speed up later. I feel FF1 is a little slow but once it picks up, it goes kinda fast and is a ton of fun.";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 09:22 PM;Most people I talk to say that VIII is reeeeeally slow to start and is that way for a while so;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 09:23 PM;"Yeah. It's a sharp contrast to FF7, which gets you right in the action right away, and it's awesome.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 09:35 PM;"Funnily enough, I find 7, to be reeeeeeally slow, and 8 starts up right away";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 09:36 PM;"7 doesn't really start, not until after Midgar";;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 09:36 PM;I have a PSone;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 09:37 PM;Wish I had one of those old ones with the Parallel ports though;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 09:38 PM;Emulators today work much better than the actual PS1;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 09:38 PM;They can have anti wobbling and perspective correction features;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 09:38 PM;Which is awesome;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-18 09:46 PM;no joker you need the Net Yaroze version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-18 09:46 PM;which came in that sexy black;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-18 09:46 PM;also the parallel port was 90% useless;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 09:47 PM;Yeah but;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 09:47 PM;I like it;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 09:47 PM;lol;;
Thelitedragon#4507;23-Sep-18 09:47 PM;And the mainboard on my PSone is broken;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-18 09:47 PM;damn;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;23-Sep-18 09:48 PM;honestly if I can find an NY version of the console for a reasonable price that would be great;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 09:51 PM;"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 09:52 PM;@Psychotic Ninja#0661 How so? You start in the middle of an action scene. It starts you in medias res.;;

Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 09:58 PM;"Since I have it out and ready to go, I played 7, currently on 8, and will play 9 and Tactics on my original PS1. I may try to emulate WotL after playing Tactics om how it was originally packaged to me because I was told it's a better version.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:06 PM;8 starts with an action packed cutscene soo...;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:07 PM;An FMV... but you don't control anyone.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:08 PM;"I do like the opening FMV of FFVIII, though. It's pretty badass.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:08 PM;And I like Liberi Fatali.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 10:08 PM;~~80% of the action is in that FMV~~;;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Sep-18 10:09 PM;100% of the budget is in that FMV;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:09 PM;100% of the budget went to the ending;;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Sep-18 10:10 PM;20% of spoilers are contained in the intro;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:10 PM;Not trully spoilers if you have no clue what's happening;;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Sep-18 10:11 PM;Its not as bad as 75% in FF12;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:12 PM;Huh? 12 is awesome.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:12 PM;"Also, action wise, yeah there's a bit story in 8 before you can actually fight, which takes like 5-10 minutes. Story wise, 7 takes *hours* before it picks up.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:13 PM;I disagree with that.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:13 PM;"It takes 5-7 hours before you hear about Sephiroth, and start the chase.";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 10:13 PM;"I mentioned it to a friend that absolutely loves FF7, but I agree. I was overall pretty bored with the gameplay until post-Midgard where I actually got to mess around with Materia";;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 10:14 PM;And the eco-terrorist plot is really just a setup for Sephy;;
pokemongenius#1474;23-Sep-18 10:14 PM;Sephiroth is mentioned way faster than that;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:14 PM;He is mentioned in like the first 30 minutes of the game.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:15 PM;Cloud mentions him to Tifa when you first meet her.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:16 PM;"Yeah a name drop, I'm talking more about an actual reason for you to go after him";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:16 PM;The main story does change in about 5 hours but it's action packed for a while.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:16 PM;Because it was presumed he was dead.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:17 PM;At anyrate Midgar does drag on for a very long time;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:18 PM;It drags a little bit at the Wall Market. I'll give you that.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 10:18 PM;"On the plus side, you get to see Cloud crossdressing 👀";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:19 PM;Not just Wall Market;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:19 PM;But I didn't feel it dragged at all.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:19 PM;"Again, all of Midgar takes about 5-7 hours";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:19 PM;And?;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 10:20 PM;Midgar was my favourite part tbh;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:20 PM;It was fun.;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 10:20 PM;I suppose gameplay-wise it makes sense it's boring;;
Marcello#4574;23-Sep-18 10:20 PM;But I really enjoyed it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:21 PM;"Look, I'm not saying you're wrong or anything like that. I'm just stating my opinion, and reasoning. If you disagree, fine, cool.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:21 PM;I find Midgar drags on far too long;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:21 PM;"and the game doesn't pick up, not until after Midgar.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:21 PM;"Story wise, I felt it was awesome... but gameplay wise, yeah I guess.. it was simpler compared to the rest of the game because the materia system opens up.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:23 PM;"But story wise, I feel 8 is dragging really badly so far. And I am about 4-5 hours into it.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:23 PM;where you at?;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:23 PM;"@Psychotic Ninja#0661 Yeah, I get it. You feel that 7 drags but I don't. But you're entitled to your opinion.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:23 PM;Timber?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:23 PM;Dollet with Laguna?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:24 PM;"I also wanna point out: My opinion on 7 dragging on might be skewed on the fact that I've beaten it like a bazillion times, and am real sick and tired of going through Midgar";;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:25 PM;"You're not alone, I feel it drags on for way too long as well";;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:25 PM;Like when you need to find all the perfect parts of the dress;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:25 PM;I just finished Granaldo.;;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:25 PM;"The necklace, silk dress, etc.";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:25 PM;"In all fairness, I did play the Triple Triad to pick up some good cards so I can mod them later.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:25 PM;ah;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:26 PM;Triple Triad does slow the game down.;;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:26 PM;I also think I'm alone in thinking the Shinra tower takes *way* too long.;;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:26 PM;But I digress...;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:26 PM;But I also spent time drawing so I can junction my spells.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 10:26 PM;"Shinra Tower took ages, and that's from someone that recently did their first playthrough of it";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:27 PM;@Olde#8956 It can if you don't know what you're doing.;;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:27 PM;Even if you do know what you're doing;;
Olde#8956;23-Sep-18 10:27 PM;But for a first time playthrough it can be agony;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;23-Sep-18 10:27 PM;"Yeah, the tower can take some time *especially if you take the stairs*";;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:27 PM;I flew threw the Shinra Building.;;
Rasea#1840;23-Sep-18 10:28 PM;I took the stairs to get all the things;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:28 PM;I never go through the back. It's stupid because you climb up 60 floors and all you get is an Ether... or I can battle and build up my kills to unlock my level 2 limit breaks.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:28 PM;I can just steal some Ethers at the Train Graveyard.;;
Perrydice#9311;23-Sep-18 10:30 PM;Although I love how the Abridged series makes fun of this.;;
qlip#0001;24-Sep-18 06:36 AM;"Can’t remember if this is actually the case but in dissidia Gilgamesh is classed as an antagonist or something when he really isn’t , , In nearly every instalment he appears as more of a rival and if anything helps the protagonists., , Ff 5 he “sacrifices” (he survives, ofc) himself to save Bartz and crew from necrophobe and in ff 8 he aids squall and crew beat seifer";;

Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:41 PM;"then again, it'd probably be cooler if we got *actual* Gilgamesh as a fight introduced into the main game, since Noct and Gilg are both kind of masters of arms";;

KaidenMelon#3452;24-Sep-18 02:46 PM;I find it odd how excalipoor does such trash damage;;
KaidenMelon#3452;24-Sep-18 02:47 PM;I mean I get its a poor mans Excalibur but still;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:48 PM;"i mean, if you use goblin punch...";;
KaidenMelon#3452;24-Sep-18 02:48 PM;But back 5o my point;;
KaidenMelon#3452;24-Sep-18 02:49 PM;I wonder what a actual fight vs gil would be like difficultywise in ffV;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:49 PM;probably not very difficult if it was set back when he was still using excalipoor;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:49 PM;afterwards though;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:49 PM;idk;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:50 PM;"anyway, since i was talking about ffxv something occured to me";;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:50 PM;i remember seeing someone in a yt comments section propose something interesting about the ravus fight;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:51 PM;"they theorized that daemon ravus was kind of a cop out here, he's *kind of* odin since he has a zantetsuken esque dash attack and his daemon half has odinlike features, namely the horns and some of the face";;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:52 PM;"i mean, i can kind of see it";https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/493872292087070720/latest.png;
Dinoken2#0946;24-Sep-18 02:52 PM;Kinda.;;
Dinoken2#0946;24-Sep-18 02:53 PM;Forgot Odin wasn't in XV;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 02:53 PM;Honestly the most enjoyable fight in the game;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:53 PM;"its a silly theory, really, since they probably would have made it more obvious that he was supposed to be odin if it was a deliberate resemblance";;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:53 PM;but;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:53 PM;its a cool little theory;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:54 PM;regardless of the fact he probably isnt *actually* not-odin;;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:54 PM;"i don't really know Odin outside of the 2d entries, so maybe ravus shares some other attacks that i just dont recognize from other variants of odin?";;
Jehanna#9234;24-Sep-18 02:54 PM;idk;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 03:13 PM;So having looked into him;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 03:14 PM;"He basically only has four defining characteristics:, -His double sided blade, -Always riding Sleipnir, -An affinity for instant death attacks, -His trademark Zantetsuken move";;

Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 03:33 PM;That sounds really odd;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Sep-18 10:48 PM;I did my best to stay as authentic as possible with FF1;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 10:49 PM;Like a great recent example is the Sylph Cave for FFIV. That place is unfair and intentionally bullshit so I abused save states before guaranteed encounters so I could retry if I wiped instead of redoing the entire dungeon;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 10:50 PM;Or some RPGs that put you into dungeons that take two hours to get through with no save points. Power went out? Start over. Accidental party wipe beyond your control? Start over;;

Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:09 PM;As an argument for using save states;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;24-Sep-18 11:09 PM;ah;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:10 PM;"But if you use Float to the whole team, you never have to worry about taking damage. That cave was not that bad, tbh. I used save states for the Sylx Tower in the NES FF3. Now that's a legit reason because that final dungeon can eat a bag of dogshit.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:12 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:12 PM;"Well, Sylph Cave is just unfair by design. There's no way you can reason it to be fair";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:12 PM;"The damaging tiles are a non-issue, as my Rosa is always lv35 by the time I'm able to do it";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:12 PM;The real issues are the bullshit enemies;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:13 PM;"Those tree things that love to spam Sleep and Fira. Fira only does like 70 damage, but there's 4-6 of them in every encounter and them casting that shit makes the battles drag on for several minutes which is just really annoying";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:14 PM;Made worse by the fact that the Sleep ailment is horse shit in IV because you have no way to deal with it. You can't buy Alarm Clocks anywhere so you just have to deal with it;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:15 PM;"The Malboros are also bullshit. You can avoid their status crap by equipping a piece of equipment that blocks one ailment of their Bad Breath, which renders you immune to it. But Kain & Cecil can't do that because they can't equip anything that guards against any of those ailments. And they're your main damage dealers";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:15 PM;"And if the Malboros can't status you into oblivion, they just one shot you for 2k+ damage";;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:17 PM;Which version are you playing?;;

Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:19 PM;It can be challenging but it isn't that hard.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:19 PM;Hitting you with an ailment you cannot possibly deal with (Sleep) and Malboros one shotting your members while leaving you unable to prepare against Malboros' Bad Breath on Cecil & Kain is just unfair and cheap and I will not play fair with a game that does that to me;;

Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:21 PM;Because it will reflect back at them.;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:21 PM;"Bad Breath isn't a spell, so I don't think Reflect would work with it. And even if it did, Malboros deal 2k+ damage so they just instantly kill Cecil & Kain if they don't status them into oblivion";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:22 PM;And the problem with Reflect against those tree dudes is that they deal 500-700 damage per hit so that makes it hard to heal anyone that gets hit by them;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:24 PM;Then use Stop and then Toad on Malboros.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:24 PM;Malboros can be turned to frogs.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:24 PM;"Once they are frogs, it should be easy.";;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:25 PM;There's often 4-6 of those tree dudes so that would take forever and I have to sit through several minutes of annoying spell casting. Fair enough about the Malboros since theere's usually only 1-2 of those annoying turd stains;;
Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:25 PM;Except for that one monster-in-a-box encounter with 2 tree things + 4 malboros;;

Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:27 PM;I'm saying I'm going to use save states if the game is intent on creating unfair dungeons to screw me over;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:28 PM;It's kinda like in FF3 the back attack Zande Clone where he blast your ass with a Meteo spell and nearly wipes your whole party out.;;

Rasea#1840;24-Sep-18 11:28 PM;I'd definitely save state that;;

Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:29 PM;I did.. it's too fucking cheap and too fucking stupid.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:30 PM;Or the Sorcerer in FF1 near the end of the Sky Fortress kills your powerful attacker with one touch or wipes your party and you gotta do the whole dungeon again.;;
Perrydice#9311;24-Sep-18 11:31 PM;The Sorcerer (known in modern remakes as a Mindflayer) in the original NES FF1 is the most unfair enemy in the game.;;

qlip#0001;25-Sep-18 08:47 AM;Ye;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 09:06 AM;"Ah. Yeah, I would say the original is the hardest followed by PS1 (if you choose not to do easy mode, which is what I do because I like how the spell casting was in the original). The GBA is easy because they really increase the encounter rate, and the PSP is kinda eh because they dramatically decrease the encounter rate.";;
pink materia 🌸#2145;25-Sep-18 09:11 AM;I wanna play FF1;;
pink materia 🌸#2145;25-Sep-18 09:11 AM;What version should I play?;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 09:31 AM;"I personally prefer the PS1 version because it has the most modern conveniences while staying true to the original NES. However, GBA isn't too bad (just sound quality isn't as good as the other games) and everyone seems to really like the PSP.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 09:36 AM;"What I like about the original is that it isn't too long of a game and has a ton of replay value. And it's super fun. My fondness for the original, though, is mostly due to nostalgia.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-18 09:42 AM;I mean tbh the GBA and PSP versions have far more replay value;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Sep-18 09:42 AM;and the original MP system I don't like at all;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 09:43 AM;"My only criticism with the original magic charges system is that it was extremely stingy in Final Fantasy I (which is a big one), so I saved a lot of my charges for the boss. Mainly the path to the boss usually was challenging. I feel they got it right in Final Fantasy III. You had enough to use magic throughout a dungeon, but you didn't have so much to make it easy but not too little that you had to be conservative with your magic. Other than that, I actually like the system as a whole. Do I think it's better than the MP system? No. But has its own merits and I think it made it challenging enough to play.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 10:58 AM;"The system probably kinda sucked but the concept is a good one, in all fairness";;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 10:58 AM;RPGs have trouble giving the player difficulty that doesn't feel cheap or artificial or tacked on. Resource management is one of those things that can give actual difficulty;;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 10:59 AM;"MP is a resource, naturally. But it's often easy to replenish in most RPGs. Save points, MP restoring items, resting, what have you. So having a sort of stingy charge system would really make you constantly weigh the frequency at which you cast spells and make you find other ways of killing enemies or healing your team";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:00 AM;"The problem is that it's so customizable that all you have to do is heavily grind and you can overpower, and it takes away a lot of the difficulty.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:00 AM;"@Rasea#1840 True. But they give you more than enough in Final Fantasy III, plus you can heal them with Elixirs, Ethers, and the HP/MP restore is generally free.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 11:01 AM;"Which is something you see often in FF. Whenever your designated white mage picks up Esuna/Raise/Arise, you basically just stop bothering with ailment-removing items and phoenix downs because why bother? Your white mage is a walking item shop";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:05 AM;"Like I said, my love for the original FF game is nostalgia... I understand a lot of its problems and I don't think, from a video game design perspective, it is the best one. Some complaints, such as the game being buggy, is a legit complaint. But other complaints, I don't necessarily agree with such as the battle system is frustrating. It has a lot of things that I like because what I don't like is rapidly pressing A or the X button to move on... that gets boring to me if I am playing a 30-50 hour game and the majority of the battles, I can just move on by using this strategy.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:06 AM;This is one of my biggest criticisms of the SNES version of FFIV.;;
Rasea#1840;25-Sep-18 11:06 AM;I wasn't picking it apart or anything o.o I was talking positively about it. From a conceptual point of view. Since I haven't experienced it and can't say anything about it specifically;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:08 AM;"Yeah, the original FF is a lot like DnD, which I like DnD quite a bit.";;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:40 AM;"i really didn't like the d&d spellcasting mechanics in FF1. i'm still active in d&d (pathfinder, specifically) but it just doesn't translate well to final fantasy for me";;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:41 AM;"it was in ff3 as well, but not nearly as tough";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:44 AM;I like Final Fantasy III overall. It's a pretty good game for the most part.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:45 AM;I like the original over the DS remake.;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:45 AM;i played 3 for the psp;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:45 AM;Not that III is perfect. I have some pretty big issues with the game.;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:45 AM;"it has some pretty big flaws, but it was a fun game. i enjoyed it more than i expected";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:46 AM;"Yeah. I think that the first 18-20 hours, with some bumps in the road, was a ton of fun.";;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:47 AM;but it does have one of my favorite jobs--geomancer. i loved that job in tactics;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:47 AM;Yeah. The geomancer is cool.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:48 AM;"I like how in the NES version, as soon as you change jobs, you go right into the job. In the DS remake, this was frustrating because you needed to do like 5-10 to readjust to your new job.";;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:49 AM;"yeah, that was really annoying";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:50 AM;"From the NES version, I am not a fan of the Garuda fight, which is pretty much use dragoons and use Jump until you win.. which I think is lame. The splitting cave kinda sucked... and of course, I probably share this opinion with most people who played the game... but the final dungeon can go to Hell. Let's add like 4-5 hours of bullshit!";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:50 AM;"And on top of it, III has probably my least favorite final boss of the series.";;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:52 AM;garuda was annoying. being pigeon holed into certain jobs is frustrating;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;3 was my first game lol;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;i love it;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;name appropriate;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;ive palyed it like nearly 10 times;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;Like I like in some cases where I was forced to use Mini so my mages make up for the handicap of physical attacks.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;yeah;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;ive actually written 2 guides on it;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;a boss guide and levelling guide;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;theyre on gamefaqs;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:53 AM;"@Luneth#8396 Yeah, overall I like Final Fantasy III. The gameplay is fun.. but it does have its flaws.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;thats how much i love 3;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;garuda was the hardest boss in the game;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;i am pretty sure i read over your leveling guide;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;"I could write a guide for 7, but I suck at writing";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;please mind the cringe i was 14 when i wrote it lol;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;haha;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;i agree perry about the flaws;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:54 AM;"it was mostly for figuring what caused a job level, because nothing in the interface tells you about JP, job exp, or anything similar";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:55 AM;I just do YouTube videos on walkthroughs. I haven't really finished too many guides but I like doing the videos.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:55 AM;i think the biggest one for me was the final bosses;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:55 AM;were really tough;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:55 AM;cause most people would generally be underlevel;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:55 AM;xande is a joke but then once u go in the world of darkness youre required to be like 5 levels higher;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:55 AM;"I only have beaten the original NES version, which she just almost exclusively uses FlareWave which does like 1500 hp of damage to all party members every turn.";;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:56 AM;i didn't have any problems until the FINAL final boss. took a few tries and i would have been wiped out in 1 more round if i didn't get the kill when i did;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:56 AM;I just bought Shurikens and had 1 ninja and 1 sage.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:56 AM;i didnt play the og versions so probs had a slightly different experience;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:56 AM;i did play the ds one so couldnt save in dungeons;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:57 AM;"My final party was Knight, Ninja, Sage, and Warlock.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:57 AM;I didn't cheese it and use two Ninjas and two Sages like a lot of YouTubers do.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:57 AM;"@Luneth#8396 In the original, you cannot save in dungeons either.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:57 AM;yeah;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:57 AM;"i mostly ran with monk, white mage, geomancer, viking";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:58 AM;i mean on phone versions these days theres quicksave;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:58 AM;so much easier;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 11:58 AM;"so i didn't have heavy offense, but great survivability";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:58 AM;from my experience for 3 you really should go for your favourite jobs rather than the strongest;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:58 AM;because levels make a huge difference;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:59 AM;if u grind a bit more and gain like 2-3 levels it will make a huge difference;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:59 AM;sure 2 ninjas and 2 sages is powerful but thats not stylish lol;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:59 AM;"In the original, I was level 52 when I beat it.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:59 AM;yeah exactly;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 11:59 AM;u can beat xande lvl 52 easily;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 11:59 AM;"@Luneth#8396 I know... I wanna do it with style. Not just use Ninjas for Shuriken power, and Sages to heal.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:00 PM;but i would recommend at least 56 to have a comfortable time in the world of darkness;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:00 PM;ive used a knight in nearly all of my playthroughs;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:01 PM;with the excalibur and ragnarok they get +10 agility which means they finally wont consistently go last in battle;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:15 PM;I was level 48 when I beat Xande. I was at level 52 when I beat Cloud of Darkness.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:18 PM;in general throughout the game youll usually be underlevel;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:18 PM;noticeable moments are the fight vs salamander and vs garuda;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 12:19 PM;yep. i had to stop and grind a few levels for each of those bosses;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:19 PM;those bosses are tough and theres no good places to train to level up;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:19 PM;the molten cave is pathetic lol;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:20 PM;and the saronia tower has terrible exp but exellent spawn so its slightly better;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 12:20 PM;it caught me off guard because everything was SO EASY. and then salamander just wrecked me repeatedly;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:20 PM;yeah fire breath is no joke;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:20 PM;gotta save those antarctic and arctic winds;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:21 PM;"For the Garuda fight, in the original, he just used Thunder exclusively, so it was pretty much change into a Dragoon and then use Jump until you win.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:22 PM;the full party attack?;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:22 PM;He used Thunder and took out like 300 hp a turn for all party.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:23 PM;So he would always miss if you used Jump with a Dragoon.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:23 PM;yeah;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:23 PM;he uses it bloody every turn;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:23 PM;"In the Famicom, yep.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:24 PM;i had a problem where i have to kill every boss with all my party members alive;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:24 PM;cos all 4 of them basically have the same exp if no one ever died;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:24 PM;"There is a disclaimer, it really just depended on when you got off the Jump. He could use it on you before you actually Jump.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:24 PM;he only has 10k hp so hes not that hard to kill with like 2 dragoons;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:25 PM;question is how long everyone can survive for;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:25 PM;I used 4 in my party.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:25 PM;Your party members can probably take 3 hits of Thunder without dying.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:26 PM;well the issue is he uses thunder then physical attack;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:26 PM;Right... in the DS remake.;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:26 PM;can very easily wipe someone out;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:26 PM;Just like Cloud of Darkness has tentacles that attack on top of Cloud of Darkness.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Sep-18 12:26 PM;"In the original, Cloud of Darkness only has one target instead of 3.";;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:27 PM;was it easier or harder;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:27 PM;u dont bother with the tentacles anyway lol;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 12:27 PM;in psp i had to kill one of the tentacles. it was devastating my party;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:28 PM;what level were you;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:28 PM;i think if you were low level it would be good to kill the lightning tentacle;;
Brion#4623;25-Sep-18 12:28 PM;i don't remember anymore. i can check when i get home;;
Luneth#8396;25-Sep-18 12:29 PM;at lvl 50+ every level you gain gives like 150hp which is fantastic;;

FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 03:13 AM;Finally finished 3 moving on to 4;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 03:45 AM;"The ending for 3 was . . . . meh. That last dungeon was unnecessarily hard. It wasn't a problem for me because I entered crystal tower at level 50 but it ruined the whole pacing of the game. What's worse is if you die before you fight the final boss or on the final boss you have to start all over. Luckily I didn't die and that last boss was lame, probably the worst boss in the series for me, even the emperor was better lol. The first 2 bosses in the tower were even a lot tougher than the last boss, once I got past them I thought well this is going to be a breeze. But after going through all that, I'm glad I took the extra time to grind a bit before entering the last dungeon because if not then it would have been hell.";;
Caius#6568;26-Sep-18 03:54 AM;The labyrinth and the tower are two of my fave dungeons;;
Caius#6568;26-Sep-18 03:54 AM;So glad they did them in XIV too;;

Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:09 PM;"@FireProne#0537 Ah okay. I originally played the Famicom version, and I pretty much have the same complaints.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:10 PM;"It sucks because I actually really like Final Fantasy III except the ending. Sure, I can forgive the Splitting Cave. Sure, I can overlook the Garuda fight.. but I'm sorry, I cannot overlook how bad the design for that final dungeon is.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:11 PM;I wasn't a fan of the Emperor from II but I think he was a better final boss than Cloud of Darkness.;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 12:11 PM;"Yeah I was just like wtf is this it was going so well lol. I had to compare the 3d version to the famicom version to see if there was any differences and then I realized it's basically the same game as the original but in 3d except a few things, the 3d version has named characters and there's probably extra dungeons.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:12 PM;Cloud of Darkness in the original just almost exclusively does one move: FlareWave. She mixes it up in the 3D remake.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:13 PM;The way to beat her is extremely boring and only mindless repetition does the trick.;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 12:13 PM;"Yup, heal, hit hard, heal, hit hard. at least that's what I did. It's always best to have a good healer or else it's pretty much game over.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:14 PM;"Change to at least 1 Ninja and 1 Sage, use Shurikens with the Ninja, use Cure 4 with the Sage.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:15 PM;Pretty much use Ninjas and Sages or you can go straight to Hell. It's pathetic. I wish that I can use any class and use their advantages against the boss like Exdeath in Final Fantasy V.;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 12:16 PM;"Yeah funny thing is I was using a ninja, and I forgot about using my shurikens. So the whole time he was just meleeing lol.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:16 PM;"But getting these classes requires going through any long dungeon, then you get them, get back out there and gain some levels to make you a better ninja or better sage.";;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 12:16 PM;It probably would have ended the game a lot faster too those shurikens look like they do a lot of damage.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:17 PM;They do about 5000-9999 hp of damage per turn. Then use either a Warlock or Sage and cast Haste on him.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:18 PM;@FireProne#0537 Are you going in order with replaying Final Fantasy games?;;
FireProne#0537;26-Sep-18 12:21 PM;"Well sort of, what happened was I finished idk if it was crisis core first or the first game. Then I thought these games are cool, I should play all of them just to see what the future and previous games are like, so then I finished crisis core and 1, then I played the beginning of 2 I got lazy and was going to go in order. But when I first started playing 7 I got addicted to it. So I ended up finishing 7. And then I went back finished 2 and now I just finished 3. So yeah I'm going in order now, but I'm skipping over 7 since I already finished it.";;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:22 PM;That's fair. I just finished replaying 7. I actually like it more now than I did before I replayed it.;;
KaidenMelon#3452;26-Sep-18 12:22 PM;I mean;;
KaidenMelon#3452;26-Sep-18 12:23 PM;You can beat her without the ninja or sage;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:23 PM;I started in November of last year replaying through Final Fantasy because I like it so much.;;

Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:23 PM;As a 30 year celebration.;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:24 PM;"But I decided to play 2 as I never played 2 before to completion. Once I finished that, I was like why don't I go in order. So far I have replay 1-7 and am currently working on 8.";;
KaidenMelon#3452;26-Sep-18 12:24 PM;Neat;;
Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 12:25 PM;"@KaidenMelon#3452 If you level it up high enough, the Onion Knight is the best class in FF3.";;

Perrydice#9311;26-Sep-18 01:05 PM;"I am liking it a little more since the story is finally starting to move a little. For a while, I was getting frustrated because of how slow the beginning is and how you play Triple Triad and the people never play the card you want.";;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Sep-18 03:40 PM;The channel topic says you have been warned!!;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;27-Sep-18 03:41 PM;So of course they might expect some dude to just say something straight to the point;;

action warrior#8892;27-Sep-18 03:41 PM;Sounds like you got something spoiled and just regret going there but don't wanna admit it lol;;

Marcello#4574;27-Sep-18 03:43 PM;"However, it's just idiotic to randomly scream spoilers that nobody will care to respond";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 03:45 PM;When the whole point is that if you don't want to be spoiled;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 03:45 PM;Then dont visit the channel;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 03:45 PM;I'm arguing that there is no problem;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 03:46 PM;And the solution is very clear;;

Marcello#4574;27-Sep-18 03:47 PM;It is dead and people only post idiotic shit;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 03:49 PM;That's all you have to do;;
Marcello#4574;27-Sep-18 03:49 PM;yeah it's just Ultima picking on my words and trying to be against everything;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;27-Sep-18 03:50 PM;Because if there no one breaking the rules you have nothing to complain about;;

Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:44 PM;They had to make magic work in the system *somehow* and they did a pretty good job of it;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:44 PM;"If you wanted just more of Final Fantasy 6, well, it hasn't gone anywhere";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 02:44 PM;I never said anything about 6 o.o;;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:44 PM;I'm hoping to be able to play the FFXIII trilogy eventually....;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;Please don't;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;For the sake of your sanity;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;Lmao;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;It's so bad;;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;"Oh, that's long gone....";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;I guess the people that unironically enjoy those games are just insane or have wrong opinions? :P;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;Pretty much;;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;So most tell me.... But I'd like to try it myself;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 02:45 PM;"If you like rapidly pressing the A or X button for nearly 50+ hours to continue, than XIII is the game for you.";;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:46 PM;Lols;;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:46 PM;It can't be as bad as II....;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 02:46 PM;"Also, that's something of a copout. To say that they had to make magic work somehow implies they couldn't do an ARPG where you have diehard mages. I've seen games work plenty well with mage characters functioning just fine in an ARPG setting";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:46 PM;It's close;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:46 PM;It's pretty fuckin close;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 02:46 PM;They don't have to be sitting in the corner with their thumb up their ass whispering 30 second incantations or anything;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 02:47 PM;"If you like running through linear pathways like Super Mario World map except no branching pathways, no NPCs, and hours and hours of hallways of doing nothing but fighting, XIII is the game for you.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:47 PM;13 wouldn't even be so bad if it wasn't for auto-battle;;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:47 PM;Nothing you say will stop me from trying the games if they do come to Switch....;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 02:48 PM;Part of me hopes they lost the source code just like they lost 8's source code;;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:48 PM;"Otherwise, I'm not going to get a console the games are already on, so....";;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 02:49 PM;Nobody forced you to play them;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 03:48 PM;Nope. I play them because it is a Final Fantasy game.;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 03:49 PM;"If you have enjoyment of any game, even the ones I dislike, that's awesome. I'm glad the game found someone who likes it. And that's the awesome thing about art. What one thing in art that drives a player bonkers might be the one thing that another gamer really likes about it.";;
Bruce#0080;28-Sep-18 03:50 PM;"Yeah, I might well also not like them.... Just want to try them sometime, if possible";;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 03:59 PM;"Wait what, 13 has auto-battle?";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:00 PM;Not in the auto sense of the remasters having auto-battle;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:01 PM;"Since you can only control one character and the combat is fairly fast, they give you two options for combat: Auto-Battle  or Ability. The former picks abilities for you and then uses them against an enemy of your choosing";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:01 PM;The latter lets you manually choose abilities to use;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 04:02 PM;"Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh, I haven't played it in a long time I forgot about it";;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 04:03 PM;"I mean, there are things to dislike 13 for, but the auto-battle doesn't do anything 😅";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:09 PM;"Well, people hate it because they feel it really dumbs down the game. You lose control of your party and your party uses auto-battle. Which means that auto-battle works fine basically all the time";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:09 PM;Which further dumbs down any strategy that would exist;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:09 PM;But I'm not bothered by it either;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:14 PM;"It's not just the auto battle system that's the issue. The characters are not very likable... in fact, other than Sazh, I really don't like any of them. Hope is the worst character, imo, and Lightning is a close second worst character. Also, the storywriting, especially in the early chapters, is just God awful. I will concede that the storywriting isn't bad all the way through but for every 7 or 8 scenes that are good, 2 or 3 are bad. For a 50+ hour game, that is a considerable amount of bad. Also, the formula of the game is run, fight, run, fight, cutscene, then repeat. Over and over and over again.";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:15 PM;"The battle system isn't bad, imo. It's simplistic and that doesn't help... but it just feeds into the repetitive nature of the game. Also, upgrading weapons in this game is not good either. I really don't like the Crystarium.";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:16 PM;"There are some good songs in the OST, but I found that majority of the music was either not good or not properly utilized.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 04:19 PM;*Deja vu*;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 04:20 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:27 PM;See;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:27 PM;This is the thing that gives me an advantage;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:28 PM;I have no idea what makes for good storytelling or characters. Only what I subjectively like;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:28 PM;I subjectively like most of the characters and enjoyed the story;;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 04:31 PM;"Same, I like the story and characters";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:37 PM;"One of the biggest issues with the writing is repetition. For example, they say the word hero like a billion times in the game. The NORA members call Snow this so many times, it's ridiculous. Also, it's the way they talk about Cocoon and fal'Cie and l'Cie. They basically repeat it so damn much that they beat you over your head on it, and by the end, I'm laughing at how ridiculous they are. Plus, the way that Hope's mom died could have been handled way differently and it would have made Hope more likable... instead, throughout the whole game, he blames Snow for his mom's death when the audience already knows that Snow did everything in his power to save her. He did all he could. I don't care if Hope is 14. Yes, he is acting exactly how someone his age would act. But if you want me to feel sorry for him, then just give that story exclusively from Hope's point of view and no other point of view. But since I already know where Snow is coming from, I don't blame Snow for anything that happened to Hope's mom. It's not his fault. So the entire time Hope is acting irrationally towards Snow, I feel like I just want to tell Hope dude, it's not his fault.";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:41 PM;"And Lightning is sooo unlikeable at the beginning... so I didn't feel like they build her to make me feel sympathy or empathy for herself being in the situation she is at... and when she has her resolve, I felt it was a sharp 180 from how she was. It didn't feel natural to me.";;
Caius#6568;28-Sep-18 04:46 PM;"Hope is a child, he doesn't understand at first lol";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:46 PM;So is Anakin in Episode I. He was the worst thing about that movie. I could care less if the character is a child.;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:47 PM;"I'm with Rasea. Story is subjective and I don't play games trying to find their faults. Kingdom Hearts for instance has an incredibly dumb story (*darkness within darkness*) but I love it because it's so fun. Not exactly the same with XIII, but I did like the characters and the story";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:47 PM;"Much empathy, such wow";;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:47 PM;"Ohi Bienfu, normalized your name finally";;
Izwar Vain#5689;28-Sep-18 04:48 PM;Yes okay are we moving on now :sepho:;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:48 PM;And the hallways weren't an issue at all for me. I love linear games and the fact XIII is a linear and straight up game with no bullshit minigames is a plus;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:49 PM;"I also happen to like Hope, he went from a kid to a grown-up and I thought it was a nice development";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:49 PM;Hope was okay in 13-2;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:49 PM;Ehh. I didn't buy it.;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:49 PM;I feel the same way about Hope that I feel about Noctis;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;Unbearable until they grow the fuck up later in the game;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;I don't feel much about Noctis tbh;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;At least Noctis has Gladio to beat some sense into him;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;Noctis literally grew up tho;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;Adult Noctis was pretty cool;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;Noctis did grow up.;;
Rasea#1840;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;Petition for Gladio bitch slaps Noctis every time he says something whiny or stupid DLC;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;He did grow up but there was no growth;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:50 PM;He was a petulant bitch and then suddenly he was cool;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Sep-18 04:51 PM;"There are ways to write good/bad stories and characters. There's a difference between *liking* a story/character and a story/character being *good*. The story and characters (minus Frocobo and Sazh) *aren't good* but people, myself included, like them.";;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:51 PM;"Honestly, none of the XIII or XV characters are unlikeable to me, they just don't stand out compared to some others in the series";;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:52 PM;Which isn't exactly a bad thing;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:52 PM;"But if people say that not having many redeemable qualities is the same as being unlikeable... fine, I suppose";;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:52 PM;The story was basically surrounding the emotions of all the characters.. and they just beat you over the head with their emotions throughout the whole game.;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:53 PM;I don't see how that's a bad thing;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:53 PM;"Ardyn is the first final fantasy character since...*ever*, to make me physically laugh out loud";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:53 PM;That guy is fucking hilarious;;
Marcello#4574;28-Sep-18 04:54 PM;Tales of Berseria was a completely emotional game from start to end;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:54 PM;"It was the emotional journey of challenging fate. Now, I think challenging fate is a good premise.. but I just don't like it when these characters go way over the top to make me feel something for them. It just doesn't do it for me.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:54 PM;That whole sequence on the train I was actually on Ardyn's side;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:54 PM;Because for real? Noctis doesn't have what it takes.;;
Perrydice#9311;28-Sep-18 04:54 PM;I like Ardyn. He was awesome.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:54 PM;"Or he didn't at that point, anyway";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:55 PM;He was just a whiny little bitch;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Sep-18 04:57 PM;"The story of XIII is over the top hammy, minus the hammy acting, with action cliches that people are tired of seeing.";;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:57 PM;Hey riddle me this;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:58 PM;Hope's mom falls off the bridge right?;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:58 PM;Snow also falls from the same place;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:58 PM;Snow survives.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:58 PM;"And it's not even explained, the next scene with him is just him strategizing with Gadot";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Sep-18 04:59 PM;Snow survives cause of protagonist power.;;
Left Side Worldwide#6969;28-Sep-18 04:59 PM;Because it is a video game;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;28-Sep-18 04:59 PM;Snow survives due to poor writing.;;

Rasea#1840;02-Oct-18 01:53 PM;"It is, actually :>";;
Rasea#1840;02-Oct-18 01:53 PM;I found solutions;;
Rasea#1840;02-Oct-18 01:54 PM;"-Use the Blood Sword for a cheap, easy win, -Spam Osmose on her to sap her of all MP, rendering her to only physical attacks, -Cast Blink on your party, rendering them basically invincible, -Berserk stacks (weirdly), so cast that a few times on your physical attackers to boost their damage, -Use Flare/Holy if your damage is still lacking to speed things up";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Oct-18 01:55 PM;I sold all my extra equipment for more Elixirs;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;02-Oct-18 02:01 PM;can you find a way to reacquire Blood Sword?;;
Rasea#1840;02-Oct-18 02:05 PM;Oooouch. There's only one in the PSP version so you're out of luck since you sold it;;
Rasea#1840;02-Oct-18 02:05 PM;"*Why would you sell the Blood Sword, it's obviously unique*";;

Izwar Vain#5689;02-Oct-18 07:14 PM;"Yeah, pretty amazed how you were able to go back in time to upload that video 😏";;
FireProne#0537;04-Oct-18 04:00 AM;"I finished IV, really good game I enjoyed it, definitely a game I would want to go back to and replay some day. The text at the end was so speedy tho I had to read it really quickly.";;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 07:59 AM;Nice. Which version of IV? I finished ds about a week ago;;
Wyatt#6999;04-Oct-18 08:39 AM;IV's hard ive only played it once;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 09:21 AM;@FireProne#0537 IV is a lot of fun.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 09:21 AM;"@Wyatt#6999 Depending on the version of IV you play, it can be easy or hard.  If you played the NA SNES version, it's probably the easiest game in the whole main FF series.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 09:58 AM;PSP IV is probably the easiest one and is my recommended version;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 09:59 AM;If you want a harder game I recommend the SNES JP version with the translation patch;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:04 AM;"they are the same in difficulty, only time it differs is between the other SNES regions";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:04 AM;play the 3D version if you want a harder game;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:04 AM;iirc they changed a few things on the PSP version;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:04 AM;nah original JP version is better tbh;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:05 AM;they did not change anything between those two versions that would make the game harder;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:05 AM;I know because I've played them both;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:07 AM;"hmm apparently yeah. I thought they made some minor changes, but I was mistaken for the JP and NA differences";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:31 AM;The NA SNES version of IV feels like it holds your hand way too much and half the abilities are cut from the JP version.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:33 AM;the only abilities cut were character specific ones;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:33 AM;which were mostly irrelevant;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:33 AM;and the item abilities too;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:33 AM;which are just consumable magic spells;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:34 AM;FF in general is a hand holdy series though all iterations of the game fit right in tbh;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:35 AM;Cecil has no dark knight abilities whatsoever in the NA SNES.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:36 AM;"```, abilities cut were character specific ones, ```";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:36 AM;"he had one DK attack, which you see for like not even half of the game";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:36 AM;"The only reason it doesn't matter is because they dramatically decrease the difficult so much to the point where all the bosses, for the most part, are a joke.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:36 AM;"All of them after III hold your hand pretty much during the entire game, so";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:36 AM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:36 AM;they were already a joke;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:37 AM;V doesn't really hold your hand necessarily. It was trial and error for me.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:37 AM;what is with people and grossly hyping up this game's difficulty;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:37 AM;The job system in V is incredibly flexible;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:38 AM;You can do pretty much any job combination that it works;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:38 AM;You need just a little bit of common sense;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:38 AM;really;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:39 AM;I am not saying the game is difficult... I am saying that it is trial and error.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:39 AM;how is it trial and error;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:39 AM;in a game where everything works;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:39 AM;"Well, if you choose 4 white mages you're going to have some issues";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:39 AM;:tabata:;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:40 AM;"Yes, everything works but right after the Archeovis (is that how you spell it?), they really crank up the difficulty and a lot of bosses have good counter attacks.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:40 AM;(I once ran that on the job fiesta before);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:40 AM;that's not trial and error;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:40 AM;The tower your party splits up is the only slightly hard part tbh;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:41 AM;Yes it is. You have to change your jobs to accommodate these challenges. It didn't take me one or two tries to roll over the bosses. Therefore it is trial and error.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:42 AM;And I didn't really grind.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:42 AM;Because mandatory grinding isn't fun.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:42 AM;Pretty much the rest of the game works with any combination;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:43 AM;"The final boss might be a little tough, but since you know it's the final boss you can just switch to full Freelancer and go that way";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:43 AM;I also learned in my playthrough that I dramatically underestimated the Chemist job.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:43 AM;I feel like replaying two games soon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:43 AM;"you said the difficulty cranks up because the bosses have counter attacks, what does changing your job setup have to do with that? Maybe strategy is what you're thinking of";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:43 AM;III on the NES and V on the SNES;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:44 AM;which is normal for how this game is designed;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:44 AM;I'm still wondering what are this counter attacks though;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:45 AM;Both IV and V have some counter attacks from what I remember;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:45 AM;Like when you use magic against Zeromus he counters with Big Bang (or something like that);;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:46 AM;"I remember V a bit of that, but not much either";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:46 AM;Zeromus uses BB regardless though;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:46 AM;That's true.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:46 AM;I only remember him using Blackhole to cancel buffs;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:46 AM;He counters with *something*;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:46 AM;Ah;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:47 AM;I think it's Flare?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:47 AM;possibly;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:47 AM;Archeoavis was a stupid boss in V.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:47 AM;"``` Rydia can use her summons, preferably Bahamut. Black Magic and Holy should be avoided, as they will be countered by Flare.```";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:48 AM;"How bout that fight where you face 6 bombs and if you forget to kill all of them at once, he revives the rest. You would not know that if you didn't fight him first.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:48 AM;And you are down 1 party member in that fight.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:50 AM;"Or how about Titan that caste a really strong earthquake attack as the final blow. If you forget to heal all your characters with a white mage or something, you will die.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:50 AM;"I'm just saying that if you do not use a guide, you may not know that ahead of time.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:50 AM;sure I get stuff like that but how does this reflect the whole game being that way;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;I didn't say that.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;like you can find stuff like that in any jrpg;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;Every game has some bs bits;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;I said that there are a lot of bosses that do this after the Archeoavis fight.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;Not many that I remember?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;you named 2;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:51 AM;now I have not played V in a while but I definitely remember more than 2 bosses after Earth crystal;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:52 AM;How about that... is it Leviathan that counter attacks every hit with Tidal Wave or something like that.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:53 AM;"There is a boss in the game that counters every attack you do with Tidal Wave, so unless you don't have water absorbing armor, you're dead.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:53 AM;I am not going to keep going but I named 3.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:53 AM;That's Shinryu;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:53 AM;a post game optional boss;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:54 AM;Which you have no idea it's a monster-in-box near the final boss;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:54 AM;So I'm gonna give you that one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:54 AM;yeah;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:55 AM;"Shinryu. That's right. He gives you the Ragnarok, I believe.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:56 AM;I got some really good blue mage spells and learn that Exdeath can be killed in one shot by death by math.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:56 AM;I wish there was a SNES music mod for FF V on Steam;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:56 AM;The audio quality is subpar;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 10:56 AM;I played the SF version of V.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:56 AM;I thought it was already the snes music;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:57 AM;"It does, but the audio quality isn't the best";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:57 AM;I even called them out on it;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:57 AM;is it missing like reverb and hardware stuff?;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:57 AM;"No, just lower bitrate and kinda uhhh";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:57 AM;"muffled, I suppose";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 10:58 AM;oh;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:58 AM;I recently emulated V on higan and found out the audio quality is a loooooot better;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 10:59 AM;"In fact, that's why I changed my recommendation for V/VI from Steam to SNES";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;GBA is my least favourite to play it now;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;it took you that much to figure that out;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;"~~well, it always were~~";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;"Hey, for V and VI, I would recommend the original SF and SNES versions.";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;I always recommended them;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;sad they never got the proper treatment but w/e;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;Sprites aren't a big deal for people who don't care that much (like I don't);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:00 AM;Square in the end is a shitty company after all;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:01 AM;or well their FF division is;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:01 AM;But having superb audio quality and nice patches made me change my mind;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:01 AM;I hate the Steam versions. They're so ugly.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:01 AM;SE has really mishandled their flagship franchise badly.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:02 AM;"Also, Ultima, I think you used to recommend the GBA version for V";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 11:02 AM;No I never did;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:03 AM;Alright;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:03 AM;Good;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:03 AM;"Give higan a try if you want, it's really amazing";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:04 AM;"I'm using the bsnes Accuracy core (same as higan) on RetroArch, so I can use shaders";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:14 AM;I love how VI looks on my SNES classic. It looks so beautiful.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:15 AM;I need to get motivated to start back my VIII journey.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:22 AM;"~~the SNES classic is a terrible emulator, by the way~~";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:23 AM;"Why, because it only has 21 games or so?";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:24 AM;Because it's not even nearly as accurate as the more modern emulators;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:24 AM;Also minor graphical and audio glitches;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:24 AM;If you hack it and put more games a lot of them won't even work as well;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:25 AM;The plan for me is to not hack it..;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:26 AM;"Well, if you want to play more games there it's very appealing";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:26 AM;"It has enough games to keep me interested. Yes, I wish Chrono Trigger or the Soul Blazer series, or other games not included... but whatever. I think the selection was pretty good overall.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:26 AM;"I think you can run RetroArch in it though, which makes the SNES classic actually decent";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:26 AM;I'll pass.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:27 AM;building your own emulation station might be way cheaper than the SNES classic iirc;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:29 AM;Building an emulation station is a waste of time and money. Why bother when you can do it on your computer for free?;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:29 AM;Not enough value for the cost.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:30 AM;"Following your logic, paying $80 on the SNES classic is a waste of money as well";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:30 AM;Unless you want it as a collector's item;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:30 AM;That was the idea.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:30 AM;"Also, you can build an emulation station for literally $5";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:30 AM;The Raspberry Pi Zero costs that;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:30 AM;Not worth my time.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:32 AM;"And I am not that big of a fan of emulation to begin with.. I get the appeal and I like how emulation preserves the history of some games, including some hard to find games. Other than that, I generally pick my original consoles over an emulator.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:33 AM;"I mean, you literally just have to download an image and send it to a microSD card then it's all set";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:33 AM;~~the SNES classic is an emulator~~;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;So is the Wii Virtual Console? What point are you trying to prove?;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;You just said you didn't like emulation;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;Except they are legal.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;All emulators are legal;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;No exception;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;BS.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:34 AM;It's not bs;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:35 AM;Then why are websites being shut down for emulation?;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:35 AM;ROM sites are being shut down;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:35 AM;Because it's illegal to distribute copyrighted ROMs;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:35 AM;"And how do you play a game on an emulator? From an illegal ROM, generally.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:35 AM;The legal way is having the physical media game and ripping it yourself;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:35 AM;^ read here;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:36 AM;"So, for instance, if you buy FF VI on the Wii to play on the Virtual Console you can copy the game to your PC and extract the ROM";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:36 AM;Then you play it 100% legally;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:37 AM;"Or I can play it on my Super Nintendo, which I have... or the SNES classic, which I also have and don't have to worry about ripping games in whatsoever.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:37 AM;Too much time that I don't wanna spend.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:38 AM;I just download it illegally because literally no one cares and I already have another version;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:39 AM;"There are tons of reasons to play on emulators, such as using patches (fixes, addendums, difficulty mods), or using shaders that changes graphics to your liking";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:39 AM;Also dishing analogue hardware in favour of better graphics/audio quality;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:41 AM;"Well, I used to be an emulator type of guy because I was too lazy to pull out my old systems and replay them, but I am having much more fun pulling these systems out and playing them how they were originally packaged to me. When I played VI, it was the same cartridge I had when I was 6 years old and I felt like I was kinda reliving my childhood again, recently.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:42 AM;"I understand that VI on the SNES has a lot of bugs. I also understand how half the game on my FF1 NES doesn't work properly... but whatever. It kinda has its own charm, in some ways.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:42 AM;So it's literally because of nostalgia. Because what you seemed to be saying was that emulating is bad and that you hate it;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:43 AM;"There's reasons to like emulators. For me, the biggest reasons I like it is because it preserves history because a lot of these games may never ever get played again.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:46 AM;"But difficulty mods don't really appeal me. I don't like randomizers. And I am someone that would rather have these games left alone. It's like going back to the old music and fixing all the songs that have out of tune notes or a drum beat that is off timing. Those imperfections are like some of the reasons why we may like a sound or we may like a piece of art. I am not really a fan that you can save state cheese games to basically shatter the difficulty of any game; however, I do see a good reason for save states if you are a speedrunner. It does help you perfect your craft.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:48 AM;Best reasons for me are enhancing games and having them very easily anywhere you like;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:48 AM;"Difficulty mods are just an example, if you take a look at the VI romhacking website you'll find tons of patches, ranging from re-translations, to fixes, and stuff";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:49 AM;Such as replacing the abhorrent Woolsey translation;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:49 AM;Playing them on the phone is kind of a good reason.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:49 AM;"About savestates and fast forwarding, they're not valid reasons because you don't even need to touch these features";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:49 AM;"@Marcello#4574 That's fair. I wasn't a fan of the Woolsey translation, either. It's not gonna make or break the game for me, but I can see replacing the Woolsey translation with like the GBA translation or something.";;

Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:50 AM;"This is how the game looks here, by the way. I don't normally use shaders, but I wanted to try this one";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:50 AM;"It's a NTSC shader with scanlines, but there are tons of flavours as well";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:50 AM;Looks blurry.;;

Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:51 AM;without shaders and with the bilinear filter (that blurries the game a lot);;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:52 AM;"I prefer playing like this, but there are some other upscaling methods";;

Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:52 AM;"Not a fan of this one, because it produces a very cartooney look";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:52 AM;The second picture looks better than the first one.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:53 AM;But it's also an option;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:53 AM;"I agree, I prefer a sharper look";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:53 AM;"I guess if it floats your boat, go for it.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:54 AM;The second and the third look the same to me.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:54 AM;You probably need to zoom in;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:54 AM;I did.;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:54 AM;But exactly. I can play my games the way **I want**;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:54 AM;"Yeah, if it floats you boat, go for it.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:55 AM;Nobody is wrong for using emulators.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:55 AM;But I am not wrong for my preference of playing the originals.... most of the time.;;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 11:56 AM;"Except for like FF1, FF2, and FF4, I actually prefer the original version of every Final Fantasy game from 5-15 over remakes.";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 11:57 AM;Which is fine. I'm only defending emulation as a viable (and many times technically better) method;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:12 PM;"So, I want to butt in this real quick here";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:13 PM;"Firstly, while distributing ROMs and ISOs of games *is* illegal, that's not why they're being taken down. Disney has been (for a while now) lobbying for copyright laws. Because they have some things from the 50s they're not proud of and want to ensure it stays under lock and key forever, instead of being used as a teaching experience and having it be part of media history";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:14 PM;"As a result, these copyright laws also affect games. Which means that you need express permission to distribute the IP, even for ones that are old af and no one really cares about anymore";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:14 PM;"Which affects game preservation, because a big part of emulation is being able to preserve games of all kinds, which copyright law directly inhibits";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 01:22 PM;On a related note;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 01:23 PM;"archive.org stores a ton of old games, and they got a DMCA exemption to preserve vintage software";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 01:30 PM;Nice 👍;;
Brion#4623;04-Oct-18 01:46 PM;"i love emulators and will use them pretty much any time they are an option. for me, the console is just an unnecessary and expensive accessory";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:23 PM;"I just feel that I don't get the same feel of playing older games as I do by playing the original. Now, here's the thing: I first played all these games when I was a kid so I had the luxury of owning them growing up. Not everyone has that luxury, and for them... it's great if you can get the originals but I understand the appeal of emulation, and if that's how you wanna play the game, more power to you. As long as your a fan, in the end, that's all that matters.";;
Perrydice#9311;04-Oct-18 02:24 PM;I played Terranigma on an emulator because buying a PAL version of the game is expensive and it really isn't entirely worth it to get one.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 03:38 PM;I don't mind either one;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Oct-18 03:39 PM;But usually I prefer original hardware;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:25 PM;@Rasea#1840 his boss fight scales with his stats;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:26 PM;"Okay, but their health won't, right? So it'll take ages to kill them";;

Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:26 PM;"No, it doesn't take long";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:26 PM;I think you can pretty much spam Lancet and never even heal;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:27 PM;Lemme go check something on that;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:27 PM;Also I'm in the process on writing another FAQ :>;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:28 PM;"See you next year, as usual :>";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:28 PM;Shush you;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:29 PM;"Also, looked into it, you're right. Their HP, STR, MAG & AGI are variable based on Kimahri's stats. With only 30 DEF. Which Lancet bypasses because it's fixed damage. Around 90-ish iirc";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:29 PM;Which also means it'll out-heal anything they can do if Kimahri is stuck at his original point;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:30 PM;God that's really sad;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:30 PM;Though I prefer actually using Kimahri since he can get Steal & Use if you don't want to give it to Tidus;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:31 PM;"Let's be real, for a blind/first playthrough you barely use steal/use";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:32 PM;Wrong for me. I used it a decent amount on my first playthrough with Rikku. Not *nearly* as much as I should have;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:32 PM;Did you have a guide?;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:32 PM;"And really sub-optimally, because I only stole from like... 30% of the enemies you can steal from";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:32 PM;~~lol of course you did~~;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:33 PM;"On my first playthrough? No. Well, okay, technically wrong (not about the guide thing)";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:33 PM;I got stuck on Seymour Flux on my very first playthrough when I was like 13 or something on the PS2. I quit and came back to it when it got remastered on the PS3;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:34 PM;See lol;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"I remembered getting my ass handed to me, so what I did was that I grinded on those robot things at Bevelle and beat Flux afterwards";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:35 PM;I never used a guide or any resource when I did it on PS3;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:35 PM;So it was blind :P;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:35 PM;There's not much incentive to steal since most of them don't give anything immediately useful;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"My idiot 13-year old self thought it was a good idea to just keep running from point to point, never stopping for steals or sphere levels";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:36 PM;So I was just terribly underprepared and underleveled for Flux;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:36 PM;"Unless you like to spend a lot of time stealing and learning, which can be very time consuming";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;04-Oct-18 05:36 PM;AHHHH FFX... I'm outta here;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:36 PM;"And also that's wrong, lots of early-mid enemies have tons of useful steals for Aeons, equipment & Use";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:37 PM;"That's also why I made that item guide for FFX so people can have a short, concise information resource on what every item does and how to get it";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:38 PM;"They do, but at that point you're already tired of stealing pointless stuff and doing chip damage with Rikku";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:38 PM;That's how it was on my playthrough at least;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:39 PM;"True enough. If playing blind, anyways";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:39 PM;I think I eventually stopped using Rikku because I didn't understand Mix and I had no idea how useful the various items were;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:39 PM;Along with her mediocre attack damage;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:40 PM;Exactly;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:40 PM;IX had a very useful steal;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:40 PM;"But hey, it's there for subsequent playthroughs or for people just wanting to jump in with all the information";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:40 PM;First because Zidane actually does damage;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:40 PM;Also for myself (when I get the game again and replay it) because cross checking information is a major pain and I could not fathom why no one had bothered to create a singular resource for it. But meh;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:41 PM;and then because you know when you need to steal (mostly equipment from bosses);;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:41 PM;"Yeah, it sucks that Mug is near the end of her path";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:41 PM;"See, I really don't like that kind of steal system";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:42 PM;"iirc none of them are missable, but at least you know you need to steal";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:43 PM;I suppose it's good for blind playthroughs or new players. Since all you really need to know is use steal on bosses until you get equipment;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:43 PM;But it feels like a really lackluster steal system because that means 95% of the monsters in the game are not worth stealing from;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:44 PM;"Whereas FFX not only has some great steals on some bosses that you want to take advantage of, but because most enemies have useful steals and gives Rikku a real role as opposed to most steal happy archetypes";;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:44 PM;At least it's friendly for blind playthroughs;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:44 PM;Yeah;;
Marcello#4574;04-Oct-18 05:45 PM;I don't consider having to use guides to make the best use of steal/use possible a positive thing;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:45 PM;"I mean, you don't *have* to. Trial & error is how people figured it all out. Lots of it. Steal (the command and its mechancis) is also the best in FFX";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:46 PM;Since it doesn't have stupid ass complicated formulas or anything like that;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:46 PM;"It's just 100% on your first attempt, then halved on every subsequent steal";;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:46 PM;With a 75/25 common/rare split;;
Rasea#1840;04-Oct-18 05:47 PM;"As opposed to crap like it's based on your level and you can fail to steal seven times in a row, Along with the 7/8 common 1/8 rare split which is also irritating, especially on bosses that have both common & rare steals";;

Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:05 PM;"Challenge runs make sense to me, personally. And should to most people, if you think about it. You've already played a game once or twice, so you know it pretty well (probably). You want to play it again, but you prefer to be challenged like you once were. Or just want more of it. So you do challenge runs";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:06 PM;Some of them can be really fun. Particularly the No Sphere Grid challenges in FFX ~~except for the bit where you have to farm bosses for specific items but it's not too bad~~;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:07 PM;That's why I disagree with you when you say padding is good because it makes you play the game for longer;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:07 PM;Padding is terrible.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:07 PM;"For example, X's stupid minigames and the stupid grinding";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:07 PM;Amen @Marcello#4574;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:07 PM;If you make the game have a good replay value then padding is pointless;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:08 PM;"Like, KH2 isn't padded, except if you want to get 100% and do the recipe grind and all that";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:08 PM;"But then you can have tons of challenges, such as level 1 crit";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:08 PM;"I hate the minigames in FFX. They are some of the most atrocious things in a game. All the chocobo stuff, dodging lightning, butterfly collection are just God awful.";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:08 PM;That's why I prefer not having them at all and ending up with a game as linear as XIII;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:08 PM;But let's not get into it again;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:09 PM;"Minigames can be good, if done right.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:09 PM;I really like some of the minigames in Final Fantasy VII.;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:10 PM;Like my issue with the chocobo breeding is not the minigame. It's the length it takes to get the reward you want.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:10 PM;You don't need to do any of the minigames though;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:10 PM;I like the card game in Final Fantasy VIII.;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:10 PM;The arena one is nice because they're just battles;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:10 PM;Padding has nothing to do with challenges? o.o I said... nothing about minigames or anything like that;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:10 PM;It had more to do with extending your play time;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;You said you like padding because of that;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;"Well, yeah, but padding and challenge runs are two entirely different things";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;People do challenge runs of all kinds of games because they enjoy the game and want to replay it but with a twist;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;Like single character runs in FFV;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;I'm saying that challenges are way better for extending your play time;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;instead of padding;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:11 PM;Ah;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:12 PM;"Padding, to me, is artificially adding either mandatory grinding or mandatory super long dungeons just to make the game longer than it needs to be. XIII is extremely guilty of making the dungeons atrociously too long. In the beginning of the game, it's not so bad and the length of the early chapters are about the length I would expect from a linear game, but it gets worse as the game progresses.";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:13 PM;XII was way worse in that regard;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:13 PM;waaaaay worse;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:13 PM;There is one dungeon in FFXII that I can see is frustrating... That's about it to me.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:14 PM;I don't remember any particularly long dungeons in XIII. Which weren't really an issue in the same way they're an issue in convential RPGs;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:14 PM;"Yes there is in XIII: 5th Ark in chapter 10.  My goodness, that dungeon just goes on and on and on.";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:14 PM;"Well, there aren't random encounters";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:14 PM;And you can avoid most of the encounters;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;"As XIII doesn't have you manage resources, you don't get mad at the design of the dungeon because in conventional RPGs, it's a bit like adding artificial (I say it that way because some people may not feel that way) to the boss because you're working on reduced HP, MP and item stock";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;"Okay, XII has no random encounters either.";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;If you're having a hard time avoiding a specific one you can simply use the spray;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;"As XIII doesn't have you manage resources, you don't get mad at the design of the dungeon because in conventional RPGs, it's a bit like adding artificial (I say it that way because some people may not feel that way) to the boss because you're working on reduced HP, MP and item stock";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;"Nope, but it forces you to fight many of them";;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;"If you don't, they're going to follow you and maybe even kick your butt";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 01:15 PM;You don't avoid encounters in XII;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 01:16 PM;You run through them;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 01:16 PM;"A step up from random encounters, but it's not avoiding the battle";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:16 PM;And I had more of an issue with XII's big ass fuckoff maps than any dungeons;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:16 PM;~~that's why I detest the Mog clock in XIII-2~~;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:17 PM;"God, what a stupid encounter system";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 01:17 PM;Agreed;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;05-Oct-18 01:17 PM;It also makes the environment less lively;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:17 PM;Also makes backtracking a huge pain in the arse;;
Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:17 PM;"Fuck you, *that specific* Tower";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:18 PM;This is why I bumrushed XIII-2 and never touched it again;;

Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:23 PM;This is why I bumrushed XIII-2 and never touched it again;;

Marcello#4574;05-Oct-18 01:31 PM;...nobody saw that;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:31 PM;Lmao;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:31 PM;Suuuuure :P;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:55 PM;"@Rasea#1840 I think adding resources and managing your inventory helps break up the monotony of run forward fight, which is basically 95% of what you do in XIII, and it adds more strategy because you don't heal after every battle. I would have liked to have that to give me another way to interact with the game besides the battle system. Now, I don't like the battle system that much but there are things that are kinda cool about. But if that's all you do, it doesn't need to be a 50+ hour game. That's mainly my issue with XIII, and the length bored the crap out of me. It is not the same as adding more and more hallways to make the game longer than it really needs to be.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:57 PM;That's fair;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:58 PM;I thought it was super weird that you had nothing to manage in XIII personally so I get that criticism;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 01:58 PM;"Right, you healed after every battle.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 01:58 PM;However I have a caveat about that which I will point out when I'm done eating;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:01 PM;"I'll give you an example of padding... and keep in mind, I like Final Fantasy 1 and it's one of my personal favorites in the series.  The section before you get the first crystal, you go in the earth cave and then you fight the vampire so you can get the Ruby, then you have to backtrack to the giant's cave, give the giant the ruby so you can have access to the earth rod. Then you go all the way back to the earth cave, pretty much to where the vampire was, and use the earth rod to continue. To me, that is a perfect example of padding. It's one of the things I enjoy the least in FF1.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:02 PM;"Yeah, I don't really argue against people disliking padding. Also that section is really stupid and annoying";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:02 PM;I totally agree.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:03 PM;"I just happen to personally defend (by which I mean by own enjoyment, not other's) the padding in FFX for the most part because I don't find it stupid or irritating";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:03 PM;"Anywho, on the caveat thing";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:03 PM;I like X. It's a fun game overall.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:03 PM;"So an issue I have with resource management is that it's almost always to do with MP and to this day, I have only seen two games do resource management well: DQVIII and DQXI";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:04 PM;"A big part of RPGs is MP, obviously. You use it to heal, remove status ailments, inflict status ailments and deal damage. MP usually isn't an issue for healers, but it is for offensive casters. It's their only real way of dealing damage";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:04 PM;But so many RPGs have excessive costs for MP and don't balance it out. So they're sort of adding artificial difficulty by forcing the player to use weaker spells to do less damage so you don't end up with 20 MP at the end of a dungeon before a boss;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:05 PM;"For FF1, especially the NES version, my issue with the MP was how restrictive it was.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:06 PM;"I never had an issue with MP in FFVI, especially after you learn Osmose.  I thought FFVII was fine, and with FFVIII, you pretty much used physicals for the most part anyways.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:06 PM;"For FF1, that is a valid criticism, especially in the NES version because the only way you can restore Magic Charges was to stay at an inn or use a House.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:07 PM;"I'm still early in VI, so I can't speak for it. But MP has been nice to me so far and you can learn Osmose relatively early because of how espers work, along with the fact that by the time you get to lv2/3 spells, not only do they not get a massive jump in MP usage, but you have the esper that teaches you Osmose to deal with that";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:08 PM;So I'll give you VI in that regard;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:08 PM;I like how VI uses magic.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:08 PM;VII I can't concede because that's more of a factor of how you can just use Attack on most things and obliterate it easily. They also dissuade you from using spells anyways because the MP:damage ratio is extremely off;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:09 PM;"After the lv1 spells, anyways";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:09 PM;"My one criticism of the materia system is once I left Midgar and started getting summon materia, it pretty much eliminated my need for any other magic materia besides Restore.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:09 PM;Can't speak for VIII as I've never touched it and never plan to;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:10 PM;Yuuuup;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:10 PM;Summons are so much more MP efficient and give better stat boosts as well;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:10 PM;"Like the Ice materia, you only need the one Ice materia you get from Cloud. You never ever really need to buy a second one because there's barely any enemies weak to Ice.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:11 PM;"I used Lightning a lot, but once I got the Ramuh materia, didn't need it anymore.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:11 PM;"Once I got Ifrit, didn't need the Fire materia anymore.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:12 PM;"And command materia, especially the Enemy Skill materia, is way more powerful than any other.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:12 PM;If only they could balance Blue well;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:12 PM;"But yeah, totally agree there";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:13 PM;"Blue Mage magic, I don't think, really has ever been properly balanced.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:14 PM;"VI's is. It's so annoying to get, you just avoid it entirely :tabata:";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:14 PM;It's key in FFV. I used Mighty Guard in just about every major fight.;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:14 PM;"@Rasea#1840 Yeah, Strago's lores is like the one exception.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:14 PM;I was talking about Gau tho 🤔;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:14 PM;I barely use Gau because I hate getting his rages at the Veldt.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:15 PM;"Since Gau is the designated blue mage, even though Strago has the more traditional type";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:15 PM;"I used Gau a lot in the world of Balance but after that, I barely needed to use him and I just didn't feel like going to the Veldt and getting all his rages.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:15 PM;"Once I got the Marshal rage, he was good for awhile.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:16 PM;"Yeah, it's pretty stronk";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:16 PM;"In the final dungeon, I left him behind.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:16 PM;I took Gogo with me.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:17 PM;And I've read he's only worth using in WoB anyways. He falls far behind other people due to his shitty equipment draw in WoR;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:17 PM;Which is why I'm using him now since he'll just be obsolete later;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:17 PM;I agree. That was how I felt.;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:18 PM;"Cyan was pretty useful in the WoB. Afterwards, he wasn't as useful but still pretty good.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:18 PM;I love how every guide maker constantly shits on Cyan;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:19 PM;"I thought that Shadow, Locke, Terra, Celes, Relm, Edgar, and Sabin were useful throughout the whole game.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:19 PM;"I like Cyan, but I think a lot of the reasons he falls behind somewhat is because the Sword Tech gauge takes a while to fill, especially when you wanna do Quadra Slice.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:20 PM;"I'll just use Valiant Knife and the Offering with Locke. Takes shorter amount time and does as much, if not, more damage than Cyan's Quadra Slice.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:20 PM;"Yeah, the classic Cyan gets one turn while everyone else gets three";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:23 PM;"I used Locke, Relm, Terra, and Edgar in my final battle against Kefka and I was level 35-42.  None of my characters died throughout the whole fight.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:24 PM;👌;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:24 PM;"That final fight is probably among my favorites of the series, but I am biased to VI as VI is my favorite FF game.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:43 PM;"Also on that whole DQVIII/DQXI thing with MP management. Figured I'd blurb about it since why not., , __DQVIII__, This is like a more strict version of how FF handles it. MP is precious, and really tight as you only get a handful of MP restorative items throughout the game. But it's balanced out through:, 1) Battle items. Using equipment in battle to generate effects. From offensive spells to buffs to debuffs. It saves a lot of MP and is very useful. FF lacks that immensely almost always., 2) Abilities. FF lacks anything outside of attack, magic, summon. Having your physical attackers deal AoE damage or extra damage for 2-4 MP would be great., 3) Weapons. Your healer has access to a Bow & Sword. The Bow also has an ability that gives you 1/16th of your damage in MP back (later upgraded to 1/8th). Your offensive caster has access to Whips, which allows for AoE damage and good single target damage without expending lots of MP";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:44 PM;"I haven't checked out DQXI yet, but I really liked DQVIII. It's my second favorite DQ game only to V.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:46 PM;"__DQXI__, This one is more simple, but simply giving characters more MP and ways to regenerate it. Veronica gets Sage's Breath (restores 5MP per turn, takes a bit to get the ability though). Wands/staves also can attack to restore 3-6 MP (only works about 85% of the time though). You also have easier and more varied options for obtaining MP restoring items";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:46 PM;As opposed to the ever so annoying FF tradition of let's put like 10 ethers in the whole game;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:47 PM;"Oh yeah, and Yangus has access to the Share Magic ability (as does a character in DQXI) which helps a lot as well";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:47 PM;"Do you mean elixirs? Ethers are pretty easy to get in some of the games, especially FF1 (GBA and PSP), and FF7.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:47 PM;"Well, ethers only restore a bit of MP in FF7. I don't remember getting too many of them until you're able to steal them from an enemy, but you can't really know that and you're never even remotely incentivized to steal anything anyways";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;"In fact, you get so many ethers in the modern remakes of FF1 that you can practically shatter the difficulty of that game, because they sell them and they are cheap.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:48 PM;I agree with that in FF1 though;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:49 PM;"@Rasea#1840 In Midgar, especially in the Train Graveyard, you can steal an Ether to just about all the enemies there.  It's a good way to farm cash at that point in the game.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:50 PM;"And honestly, you can just use Tents. Tents are the best way to restore magic in 7.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:54 PM;I also usually try to get the Striking Staff there too because it's a very good weapon for Aeris at that point in the game.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:54 PM;Ahhh yeah now I remember;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:54 PM;The Deenglow things. I remember seeing the bestiary entry for a decent chance at ethers. But I was annoyed with how long it took to steal an item that I only got a few for selling purposes before moving on;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:54 PM;Along with the fact that ethers restore minimal MP and all that;;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:55 PM;"Oh wait, no they don't";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:55 PM;Was thinking of something else. Nevermind;;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:55 PM;"I think it's kinda negligible, similar to the stat increases and decreases from equipping materia.";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 02:56 PM;"The best way to restore magic is tents. Same with VI, despite using Osmose to restore MP, and probably with V too.";;
Rasea#1840;05-Oct-18 02:58 PM;"Ah, now I remember. An ether was good for five casts of lv2 magic which didn't take long to get to. That's why I was upset at the system. Because having 6->22 (3.7x) MP cost for x2 the damage is dumb";;
Perrydice#9311;05-Oct-18 03:02 PM;"Yeah, but it wasn't that big of a deal because I mostly used the Enemy Skill once I left Midgar. Thank you, Beta, and thank you, Big Guard.";;

ChipNoir#3597;15-Oct-18 06:18 AM;I clocked that battle once. It took me 32 minutes of repeated steals to get that goddamned flute.;;

Izwar Vain#5689;16-Oct-18 10:00 PM;Is there even a solid definition of a meme;;

Thelitedragon#4507;16-Oct-18 10:04 PM;I think Beverage deleted his account;;

Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:46 AM;Isn't the emperor in FFVI kinda badass too?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:46 AM;He used the espers as objects to extract magicite till they die;;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 05:47 AM;"Emperor Gestahl? Yeah, he's an evil cunt";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:47 AM;"Yeah, the betrayal was what hurt the most";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:48 AM;Right when you thought 'This dude is kinda good Ooof nope;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:48 AM;"Not to mention doing experiments on Kefka, Terra and Celes";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:48 AM;"Actually, now that I think about it";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:49 AM;The emperor caused Kefka to become what he is;;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 05:49 AM;Does that mean the emperor is more evil?;;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 05:50 AM;"Well, Kefka isn't inherently evil, technically. Like, yeah, he kills people and does bad shit, but he doesn't necessarily do it consciously. By way of insanity, he just does terrible things because it entertains him and likes chaos";;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 05:50 AM;Much like Joker;;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 05:50 AM;"But yeah, I'd say Gestahl wins the evil award there";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Oct-18 08:04 AM;"Kefka is just a despicable human being who wanted ultimate power, and he kills anyone who gets in his way. I would say that is evil, in my opinion, because he doesn't care about morality, human decency, or anything except himself.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 08:08 AM;"But what if Kefka's craziness stemmed from a mental illness? If in that case, I guess Kefka is kinda innocent";;
Izwar Vain#5689;17-Oct-18 08:09 AM;A mental illness caused by the experimentation the emperor had done on him;;
Perrydice#9311;17-Oct-18 08:30 AM;You can't always excuse a truly despicable person for their evil deeds because they may or may not have a mental illness. They all are mentally fucked up when they are willing to throw morality out the window. Some can be fixed by institutionalized and some can't. I think Kefka is one of those who can't be changed.;;

Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 01:37 PM;"Huh? Kefka wasn't evil initially. He was initially a normal guy, but he volunteered for magitek experimentations on himself which drove him to insanity, turning him into the maniacal, insane, chaos loving Kefka that you deal with";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Oct-18 01:45 PM;"Neither was Sephiroth.  It's like the Joker says madness is a lot... like gravity, all it takes is a little push.  Just because they don't start off as evil does not excuse that they are evil.";;
Brion#4623;17-Oct-18 01:45 PM;"ah, the killing joke";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Oct-18 01:45 PM;lol;;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 01:46 PM;"Though ultimately it's more of a psychological debate. Because I'm sure that Kefka did questionable things, being Gestahl's right-hand man. Which would inherently make him more evil than the Joker, who began as a normal guy just trying to fend for his pregnant wife and got desperate";;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 01:47 PM;"Though, on the other hand, Joker is conscious of what he does and willingly does so. His motive being wanting to show that everyone has some criminal in them and morals are easily bent, if not broken";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Oct-18 01:50 PM;"But either way, Kefka needed to be taken out because he was dangerous to the whole world, he wasn't going to change, nor did he really care about changing. He just wanted to destroy the world, become a God, and destroy everything inherently good in life. You don't negotiate with terrorist. In a nutshell, that's what Kekfa became. He reigned supreme and attempt to destroy anything that was in his way.";;
Perrydice#9311;17-Oct-18 01:52 PM;"When they rise to that level, the only way to neutralize a threat like that is to kill them.";;
Rasea#1840;17-Oct-18 01:54 PM;Fair enough;;

Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:04 PM;yup;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:05 PM;3D or non 3D version?;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:05 PM;I been playing them in order again too. I am on 8.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:05 PM;I'm debating whether I should play 3d for graphics and risk having to grind at endgame or go 2d and fast forward my way to victory;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:05 PM;I would not recommend the NA SNES version. It's really easy.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;okay;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;You don't need to grind in the 3D version except for the superbosses;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;thats *really* good to hear then;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;I have no interest in fighting superbosses like Iron Giant in 3 lol;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;Play the PSP version;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;"Honestly, I like the DS version the best but the PSP version is very good.";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:06 PM;Or JP SNES;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;"I think I'll play the mobile version then, which is basically psp";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;No;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;no?;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;Mobile is 3D;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;It is? I thought DS was mobile.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;The mobile version is the 3D one;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;Oh I see;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:07 PM;Square did an excellent job of porting the worst version to everywhere instead of the best version;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:08 PM;I'd suggest to use a augment guide if playing 3D;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:08 PM;Makes life a lot easier;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:08 PM;I'll give you V and VI but not IV.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:08 PM;hmm;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:08 PM;I've heard mixed responses from people that love both the 2d and 3d;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;Both are great;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;It depends on personal tastes generally.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;The 3D version is a lot more polarising and questionable;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;But both are good versions.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;FF4 3D is harder and has you thinking more;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;About what to do;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:09 PM;Psp is nearly flawless and very consistent;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:10 PM;While FF4 2D is quite easy;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:10 PM;If you want more difficulty then JP SNES is the way to go;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:10 PM;@Chiaki Nanami#3369 Which is a big plus because my biggest complaint on FF4 is it's easy as fuck.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:10 PM;Ye;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;"Well I do want a challenge. I felt like 3 had that down pretty well, at least for endgame bosses";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;Bosses like Lugae actually became hard!;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;Go JP SNES then;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;3D is better then JP SNES tbh;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;👀;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;I quite like the augment system;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:11 PM;@Chiaki Nanami#3369 I agree.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;"Well, if you like bad voice acting, bad graphics, the stupid augment system and slow performance... Go ahead";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;The voice acting was fine;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;The performance is good;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;I'll give you slow performance.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;But I like the voice acting.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;On any version;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;30fps world map/15fps battle isn't good;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;That wasn't the ds version;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:12 PM;It's really slow;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;"On the Steam version, it does run like ass in the battles.";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;"No, DS was slow af as well";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;15fps battle??;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;Yeah;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;how did they manage that when 3 exists;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;Still runs fine;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:13 PM;"Idk, I always felt IV was a major downgrade fromvIII";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;I don't really notice it that much.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;"If it's too slow for you, increase the combat speed";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;That's true.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;I'll take full 60fps on the PSP/SNES versions instead;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;Increasing battle speed doesn't work well;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;Except they are way too fucking easy.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;It's still slow and the animations are janky;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;Auto mode is a thing;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;JP SNES isn't as easy;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:14 PM;It basically holds your damn hand the whole time.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:15 PM;It's still easier then FF4 DS;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:15 PM;Auto mode on DS IV doesn't speed up the battles;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:15 PM;Um... the JP SNES isn't hard but it isn't like the NA.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:15 PM;"Also, who plays FF for the difficulty?";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;I love how they transformed Lugae's second phase though;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;That was hard and fun;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;3d IV is just artificially hard tbh;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;The augment system was fun;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;For me;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;It's awesome.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:16 PM;oh you mean like the lightning spell in 3;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:17 PM;:zoinks:;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:17 PM;the one that hits all and does way more than every other elemental spell;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;"Anyways, you can pick whatever version of ff4 you want to play";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;Both are great;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;I think I'll try out the 3d version;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;"Whatever is easier for you to play, I would go for it.";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;Even if it turns out to be meh I can always come back for another playthrough;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;For sure.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:18 PM;Try both versions first;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:19 PM;^;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:19 PM;I was very tempted at playing 3D because I bought it on Steam;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:19 PM;"okay, I'll play through the first bit on both then";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:19 PM;"But after playing it, giving some thought and trying the PSP one, then asking here, I decided to play PSP";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:20 PM;I got the Steam version on a package deal with TAY.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:20 PM;And TAY sucks.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:20 PM;I'm *still* mad that I accidentally gave Yang Dualcast;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:20 PM;oof;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:20 PM;Instead of Twincast;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:21 PM;I would definitely not recommend the sequel to IV.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:21 PM;FF4 TAY ON PSP;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:21 PM;PLEASE NOT THE 3D VERSION;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:21 PM;DON'T PLAY THE 3D VERSION OF FF4 TAY;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:21 PM;lmao;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;that bad huh;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;I wouldn't recommend playing it at all.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;I'm still mad Square ported the 3D versions when the PSP already included IV+TAY+Interlude and it was newer;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;FF4 TAY was fine on psp;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;Interlude is only available on PSP;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;It's basically a repeat of the original.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:22 PM;Still good;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:23 PM;I didn't think so.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:23 PM;"like, the same exact game?";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:23 PM;"No, they are two seperate games";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:23 PM;That just have a few similarities;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:23 PM;"Like you literally repeat several events that are done in the first game, except 18 years into the future with TAY.";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:24 PM;You crash a airship in mysidia;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:24 PM;You meet a hooded man;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;He has his story similar to what was done in the first game.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;Ye;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;But the rest of the tales were quite different;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;hey;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;so uh;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;rydia's 7 huh;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:25 PM;But pink haired Porom... super hot.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;is there an explanation for that;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;Big perk to TAY: Porom;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;Ye there is;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;mk;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;Play IV and you'll know who that is.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;"Actually, wasn't she 6?";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:26 PM;🚔;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:27 PM;Nooo... I don't think so.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:27 PM;Palom and Porom were like 11;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:27 PM;Or something idk;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:27 PM;Maybe they were 6. I don't know.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:27 PM;I only know of her because I had a lot of stuff for her back when I played FFRecord Keeper;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:27 PM;Rydia was 7-8.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:28 PM;Rydia is my favorite character of IV.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:28 PM;Same;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:28 PM;She's one of my favorites characters in all of video games;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:28 PM;"Followed by Kain, then Cecil.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:29 PM;My favorite character is Locke from VI.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:29 PM;kain seems like a badass;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:30 PM;"Then maybe Vivi from IX, then Balthier from XII, then maybe Steiner from IX.";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;"Anyways, 4 is when the series started to become really good";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;So enjoy;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;"I don't really have a favorite character yet, FF1-3 characters have like no personality 😗";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;FF4+ changes that;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;Refia's cool i guess;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;yess;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:31 PM;Alright well im gonna do some stuff then dive into 4;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;"In the original FF3, it worked like FF1 where you named your characters.";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;I love Locke too;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;He's a great character;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;you can name characters in SNES4?;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;You still name them but they have canon names in ff3 ds;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;oh 3;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;yeah i heard they're all onion generics in the og;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:32 PM;3;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;"you can still name them in the remakes, i just chose not to";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;You can change the names of the characters in 4.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;By Namingway;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;nice;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;But don't change their names;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;gonna name my Cecil dickman;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;But I usually keep it as is.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:33 PM;o;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:34 PM;yeah im gonna leave defaults on my first playthrough so I can learn names;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:34 PM;"I did a FF1 NES journey and I did fighter, thief, white mage, black mage and named them Dick, Cock, Balz, and Dong.";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:35 PM;smh lol;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:35 PM;Lmao;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:35 PM;I was bored and thought it was funny.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:35 PM;"I named my party after the Bravely Default cast, since that's what got me interested";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:35 PM;Ye Bravely Default is great;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:35 PM;One of my best friends named his characters after serial killers.;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:36 PM;Sounds great;;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:36 PM;"The four heroes of the world, serial killers!";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:36 PM;lmao;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:36 PM;"I was like really, dude?";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:37 PM;I wish I had friends who played FF;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:37 PM;"It was like Gacy, Dahmer, and I can't remember the other two.";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:37 PM;"Next time im gonna play my names are gonna be , I - Warrior, LOVE - Warrior, notu - White Mage, FFI - Warrior";;
Chiaki Nanami#3369;19-Oct-18 09:37 PM;Gtg;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:37 PM;"See you later then, and thanks for answering my questions";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:38 PM;There's a challenge to complete NES FF1 with four white mages.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:38 PM;my only question is;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:38 PM;why;;
Emiruko#0314;19-Oct-18 09:38 PM;why not?;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:39 PM;i could think of several reasons :^);;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:39 PM;I think Nintendo Power made the challenge.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:40 PM;I usually have a thief despite it being useless in the original NES.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:40 PM;yeah I just went with the default party;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:41 PM;It's too bad the programmer sucked.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:41 PM;what did he do wrong?;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:41 PM;The original NES is bugged as fuck.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:41 PM;Half the spells don't work properly with most not working at all.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:42 PM;lolwhat;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:42 PM;they didnt bugfix?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Oct-18 09:42 PM;Can't update NES games;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Oct-18 09:43 PM;"Games were buggy back in the day, they're buggy now. Nothing's changed";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:44 PM;"So the way running away is supposed to work is it is supposed to check the Luck stat against the enemy's agility. If it's higher, you have a higher chance of running away. Instead, it checks the stat digit of the status of your own party. So basically, the one defining trait the thief has is moot. He can basically run at the same rate as any other character.";;
Emiruko#0314;19-Oct-18 09:44 PM;they can fix bugs easier now at least;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:45 PM;"Also, intelligence doesn't work, temper and saber doesn't work.";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:46 PM;did they even play the game after making it?;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:46 PM;:tabata:;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:47 PM;Probably not.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:47 PM;There's more bugs than just what I named.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:48 PM;Lock doesn't work at all. Lok2 actually increases the enemies evasion instead of decreasing.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Oct-18 09:49 PM;They had playtesters. They can't/won't catch all the bugs. It's true with every game;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:49 PM;But it's really really bad in the NES FF1.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;19-Oct-18 09:51 PM;"True, but it's not like it's the only NES game that's really buggy";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:51 PM;lol @ lok2 increasing evasion;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:52 PM;"However, Hel2 (which is Healara, heal 2) works like Hel3 (Healaga, heal 3) in battle.";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 09:52 PM;"I think that's the only bug that actually works in the player's favor... otherwise, all other bugs make the game harder.";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:53 PM;its amazing how much more complex games have gotten;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:53 PM;"its only been what, 35 years?";;
Rasea#1840;19-Oct-18 09:54 PM;"`Can't expect playtesters to catch all the bugs` Yeah, definitely. But it's not that hard back then. You have a lot less variables then than you have today. For something like Saber and Temper, **two easy to test and important buff spells**, that should've been super obvious";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:56 PM;"On a different note, did anyone actually grind up to fight iron giant in 3?";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 09:58 PM;the reward seemed...disappointing for the amount of work they expect you to put into it;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;I did the superbosses in 7.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;@Rasea#1840 it wasn't that easy back in the day. Debuggers weren't as robust as today and you didn't have the help of compilers to write readable code;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;Anyone who ever wrote Assembly code knows what I'm talking about;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;did they write in raw unicode?;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;It's that kind of shit that adding one line of code can break the entire thing;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;...raw unicode?;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:01 PM;what are you talking about;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:02 PM;binary;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:02 PM;sorry;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:02 PM;"Technically, yes";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:02 PM;Because Assembly instructions are literally macros for binary code;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:02 PM;I know nothing about coding.;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:02 PM;that sounds unimaginably tedious;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:03 PM;You bet your arse it is;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:03 PM;"im going into the computer science major so i've begun working with code, if that's what they were working with all is forgiven";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:04 PM;Compilers weren't a thing back in the day;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:04 PM;They became evident and practicable in the PS1 days;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;"The PS1 had a MIPS architecture, with simple instructions and a simple design";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;yeah no kidding;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;So they'd have to read the binary when searching for bugs;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;Writing C compilers for MIPS is incredibly easy;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;...not exactly;;
Rasea#1840;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;Shhhhh let me be ignorant;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;You can translate the binary code to Assembly;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;this is my major so i'm interested haha;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:05 PM;Assembly is one level above binary;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:06 PM;"For instance, a load into memory instruction in assembly have this format `lw r0, $(desl)r1` iirc";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:07 PM;I just make reports at work on my computer.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:07 PM;It literally tells the CPU to load a variable from the memory address in the r1 register + the offset into the r0 register;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:07 PM;I program my home computer. Beam myself into the future.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:08 PM;It will be translated to something like `opcode + register1 + register2 + offset`;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:08 PM;the `lw` opcode is... let's say 00001;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:08 PM;The rest you convert to binary;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:09 PM;That in C is transparent;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:09 PM;absolutely dreadful;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:09 PM;"`x1 = x2; // loads variable x2 into x1`";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:10 PM;The compiler handles memory addresses and all that;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:10 PM;I think I understand.;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:10 PM;A^2 + B^2 = C^2;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:11 PM;"So like, assemblers can only interpret a single type of statement., Something like z = x + y would require several lines to assemble instead of one";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:12 PM;and would be much less obvious without a lot of patience or annotations;;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:13 PM;😵;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:13 PM;Precisely;;
themockingguy#6969;19-Oct-18 10:13 PM;"That's the purpose of higher level languages. in the end the final product they produce is Assembly code, so the process for the programmer is quicker and easier";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:14 PM;"Here, just used a compiler explorer to show you what I'm talking about";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:14 PM;"```nasm, sqrt(int):,   push rbp,   mov rbp, rsp,   mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi,   mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4],   imul eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4],   pop rbp,   ret, main:,   push rbp,   mov rbp, rsp,   sub rsp, 16,   mov edi, 5,   call sqrt(int),   mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax,   mov eax, 0,   leave,   ret, ```";;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:14 PM;My baby brother knows programming.;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:14 PM;This returns the 5 * 5;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:14 PM;"I wrote sqrt, sorry";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:15 PM;"It needs to deal with the stack, putting arguments there, popping, a lot of stuff";;

Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:15 PM;This is the C code that produced that Assembly code;;
themockingguy#6969;19-Oct-18 10:16 PM;"I like that we are having this disscussion in #spoilers , so non-programmers arent spoiled the magic of programming";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:16 PM;"thats crazy, and explains how we've been able to improve our efficiency so drastically";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:16 PM;"Well, not exactly, more like our productivity";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:17 PM;Being able to write less with more safety;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:17 PM;Also note that Assembly code is architecture/platform dependant;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:17 PM;So writing in C allows you to compile that code everywhere;;
themockingguy#6969;19-Oct-18 10:18 PM;"For example, Cleaning memory is a PITA to do in assembly, that's why languages that include garbage collection are/were so popular. having the compiler do it auto-magically for you is great";;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:19 PM;Memory management can be a nightmare in low level languages such as C/C++;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:19 PM;Not as much in C++;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:19 PM;And in Assembly it's literally hell;;

Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:20 PM;ah;;
themockingguy#6969;19-Oct-18 10:21 PM;"but leaving there now useless data, that you arent using anymore, is wasteful";;
themockingguy#6969;19-Oct-18 10:21 PM;so you needed to manually unset it and free that memory;;
Marcello#4574;19-Oct-18 10:21 PM;"technically, the quickest way to store data is in one of the registers";;
Junior#5133;19-Oct-18 10:21 PM;"so if you wanted to, say, store a variable, you'd need to tell it where to go and make sure you dont accidently write over it?";;
themockingguy#6969;19-Oct-18 10:21 PM;yes;;
Perrydice#9311;19-Oct-18 10:21 PM;You know what was cool was working with the loading times of FF in the PS1 era.;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;21-Oct-18 10:55 AM;"Due to the framerate, I believe";;

Izwar Vain#5689;21-Oct-18 10:58 AM;The pope or Raines;;

Izwar Vain#5689;21-Oct-18 10:59 AM;Wasn't the pope just in Gran Pulse?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;21-Oct-18 10:59 AM;He's a Fal'Cie;;
Deep#9598;21-Oct-18 10:59 AM;"He's a fal'cie, so he has powers";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;21-Oct-18 10:59 AM;Takes him two seconds to move;;
Izwar Vain#5689;21-Oct-18 10:59 AM;LMAO 😂;;
Izwar Vain#5689;21-Oct-18 11:00 AM;"So the pope gave them an airship, and they used that to stop him?";;
Deep#9598;21-Oct-18 11:00 AM;He wants them to kill Orphan;;
Deep#9598;21-Oct-18 11:01 AM;He's under the impression they'll do it;;
Deep#9598;21-Oct-18 11:01 AM;And Orphan happens to be right in the heart of Eden;;

Izwar Vain#5689;21-Oct-18 11:02 AM;But is it okay if I ask more? 😅;;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;21-Oct-18 12:02 PM;Hmmm;;

The paladin I found had that issue, too";;

Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:16 AM;👌;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:16 AM;I only have two atm;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:16 AM;FF13 and DQXI;;

Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:17 AM;But I was just joking anyways :P I only plat games I love and don't have stupid ass trophies;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 01:19 AM;"Also, speaking of DQXI, you've brought up how the game has options for defeating enemies, outside of Attack. However, I'm about 12 hours into the game, and I haven't seen anything unique to the combat system, to how you described it, that's in other JRPGs, like FF,and Ni No Kuni.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:20 AM;Early on your options are fairly limited as you don't have access to a lot of abilities;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:20 AM;Later on it gets much better;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:20 AM;Mainly through various status inflicting spells and status inflicting abilities;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 01:20 AM;Same can be said about the FF series;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:20 AM;And more skill points to change your weapon type;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:20 AM;Since you can switch equipment in combat without using a turn;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:21 AM;"Well, from the FF's I played, it's always about magic and attack, with characters defined (and thus shit characters exist) by their limit breaks or special mechanics";;

Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:21 AM;DQXI's characters all have very unique and useful roles throughout the game;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:22 AM;"And, by extension, there are no bad characters in DQXI";;

Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:22 AM;Nice 👍;;

Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:22 AM;"Ah, but different";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 01:23 AM;but similar enough;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:23 AM;"Veronica has access to whips, which can inflict status ailments and also can remove buffs from enemies. Serena can deal damage through Woosh, white mages almost never can deal damage until Holy. Erik is your best damage dealer lategame with swords. Thieves also don't get access to status inflicting attacks or massive burst like Erik does";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:24 AM;The other characters are also unique in their own roles as well once you get them;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:24 AM;None of the characters are bad and remain useful throughout the game;;

Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:42 AM;"Okay, done eating. So at the risk of typing out an essay, I'll go ahead and do it";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:43 AM;"Basically, DQXI is designed far better than most FF games. The pinnacle of choice in FF games (having not played 8 or 9) is 10 and 5. 10 being more a case of anyone can be anything and 5 being anyone can be anything and you can mix shit up to your pleasure. Both are nice, obviously. But it's still mostly a case of use strongest magic, attack hard";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:45 AM;"DQXI works very differently. Firstly, enemy types exist. Specific enemy types that are difficult to deal with. You have abilities that are designed to deal with those enemies better. They don't trivialize them, but it's a boost you normally won't have., , Additionally, status effects. Through both spells and abilities. This is a big deal because melee attackers in FF is always a brute force contest rather than any level of strategy or choice. In DQXI, there are dangerous enemies and bosses that can be dealt with better with status ailments. Another thing is that DQXI is designed to give you the ability to make the game harder (Draconian Settings) so you actually have a reason (if you find normal mode too easy) to use all those tools the game gives you";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:46 AM;"None of this ever exists in FF, because FF encounters are meant to be trivialized. It's always kill them ASAP before they kill you or basically auto pilot stuff to grind away";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:47 AM;"Bosses are also *very* rarely susceptible to any status ailments (that aren't poison). If they are, it's usually before you have the ability to have access to them, which makes their susceptibility to them moot";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:47 AM;There's a lot more variance and balance in DQXI than you get in FF;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 01:48 AM;"Another thing that you can set up a team at a point (won't say when, spoilers, but it won't take too long for you) that doesn't include a white mage archetype because of how the game is designed. Which is a wonderful change of pace";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 02:07 AM;"Enemy types also exist in FF, status effects, both through spells and abilities, exist in FF. The kill them ASAP before they kill you can also be said about DQ XI. Bosses *shouldn't* be susceptible to many status ailments. They should require different strategies. Hell, enemy types is a big deal in FF X, including exploiting them. Which, also is what makes it one of the easiest main FF. Yes, DQ and FF handle things differently, they're not 100% the same, and that's fine. There's no wrong way to handle a JRPG.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:09 AM;Naturally. On that last bit;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:10 AM;"Most FFs don't have abilities. They might have equipment with a chance of inflicting status ailments, though. Enemy types are also different than in FFX quite a bit since they become a problem quickly. Rather than just being a nuisance like they are in FFX. But also the extremes. Because just you match up X and Y well doesn't mean they die in one hit like they do in FFX";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:11 AM;"The thing with status ailments *is* different strategies. Most bosses in FF basically boils down to lessening the impact of their high damage moves and any status they can inflict, then dealing the most damage possible while spamming heals with your white mage";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:11 AM;Very different in DQXI;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 02:12 AM;Inflicting status ailments to beat bosses on Stronger Enemies (even moreso with No Armor & Accessories/No EXP From Weaker Enemies) becomes important because it asks that the player do something other than brute force everything;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 03:54 PM;"@Perrydice#9311 the peace the citizens get between Sin's defeat, and it's resurrection is worth it, in the eyes of Spira.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 03:55 PM;except there really wasn't much risk involved into defeating sin.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 03:55 PM;also the dialogue is not that great. i really don't like the overall voice acting direction.;;

Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 03:59 PM;"i don't like the story that much and the dialogue is not great, imo. it really is what is holding me back from upping it in my list of favorite final fantasy games. i just think that what it lacks in story, it makes up in gameplay.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 04:01 PM;"X's story is meh, then it starts to pick up with Operation Mii'hen. It becomes great with the death of Seymour in Machalania Temple (or however you spell it)";;

Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:12 PM;"there is a difference between someone being a troll and someone giving a difference of opinion. i love final fantasy i on the nes despite its flaws. i may not agree that the ineffective attacks are frustrating, but i at least can see where someone is coming from with that assessment. i like it because it just increases my strategy going into battles because, to me, rapidly pressing a or x to move on in a fight is boring and uninteresting like in mystic quest and ffxiii.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 04:13 PM;Blame FF for having uninteractive combat systems;;

Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:14 PM;i love the atb system. why do you think ff used it in ff 4-9?;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 04:22 PM;NInja pls;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 04:22 PM;ATB doesn't mean the combat has to be uninteresting or unbalanced;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:24 PM;it's well balanced in chrono trigger. i never felt overpowered and i never felt like i needed to grind.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:25 PM;"i think it's balanced in final fantasy vi. final fantasy vii, it's balanced until you unlock the materia system completely, then i felt i was really overpowered.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 04:26 PM;"No, I mean balanced as in making the combat interesting and not spamming attack or your strongest magic";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:27 PM;"i wasn't bored in chrono trigger whatsoever. in fact, i felt the combat was really interesting and fun... plus, every character has their advantages and disadvantages.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:28 PM;you didn't have to spam the same attack over and over with mindless repetition. you can use different attacks to yield different rewards.;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:29 PM;"final fantasy viii has some really bad balance issues. it's pretty much you can stick with physicals throughout the whole game. magic, for the most part, is rendered useless or not needed for the majority of the game.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 04:29 PM;See? It can be fun and interesting;;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:31 PM;"although i like the materia system in final fantasy vii, my big complaint is because the materia system is sooo customizable and levels up on its separate path, it really doesn't matter who is in your party. for example, in my last playthrough of ffvii, i barely used cait sith... and once i maxed out yuffie's weapons and limit breaks, i left her out of the party.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:31 PM;"i used cid and tifa throughout a lot of my playthrough and threw barrett and red xiii in here and there. once i got to the end, i used cloud, tifa, and cid.";;
Perrydice#9311;25-Oct-18 04:33 PM;"i also used vincent... that deathblow, mixed with added cut, and his sniper weapons = gold.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:19 PM;"@Rasea#1840 this is what I'm saying. You can do various different things in FF. If you set uo your materia right, you can do elemental attacks. Same with the junction system in 8. There's elemental weapons in 1-4 (maybe even in 5 & 6). You can also junction status based attacks in 8. , , There's so much customization in these games, but you (and possibly others) overlook these in favor of bashing with a sharp stick. DQ XI is no different. You can bash enemies with a sharp stick, *or* you can spice things up, using spells and abilities.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:22 PM;"Oh yeah, two games out of the series. My bad 👍";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:23 PM;Clearly you missed the part where I mentioned the elemental weapons in the earlier titles;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:24 PM;"Oh, and the battle items";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:25 PM;Those barely even count. It's just equipping a piece of equipment so that your Attack command does more damage;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:25 PM;IE brute force;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:26 PM;Not to mention having annoying downsides;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:26 PM;"Admittedly the materia system is strong (if really unbalanced), but there's seldom reason to really dig into it given that most of the game is piss easy";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:27 PM;Not counting the ANT mod;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:29 PM;Like how the Abilities in DQ XI is Brute Force...;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:30 PM;"Alsk, if it counts, it counts";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:30 PM;"But there's variance and balance. FF has... fire, ice and lightning. Holy if you count... well, Holy. Gravity is % based so not an elemental type. Poison isn't an elemental type and rather just a magical attack with usually high power while also possibly inflicting poison";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:31 PM;"DQ has... fire, ice, lightning, earth, dark... and wind. Oh, wind exists in some FF games. That too";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:31 PM;Aero is kinda rare I think so it slipped my mind;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:32 PM;So both have variety;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:34 PM;"DQ often gives you more choice because of how it functions. FF is heavily equipment based. So it's annoying without constantly rummaging through menus and dealing with out of combat equipment and stuff., , In DQ's case, not only can you equip elemental weapons (and elementally resistant armor and accessories) quickly, but you have access to elemental abilities that allow for quick elemental targeting. You also have abilities with status infliction on them, which makes it considerably less tedious to target statuses on enemies";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:34 PM;"More variance in equipment setup, more variance in party composition as well";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"All of which, is nothing new";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"Of course, DQ's variety is just better";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:38 PM;"I wouldn't say it's better, and I wouldn't say FF is worse. Both handle it differently,  and DQ XI's system is very similar to FF X's";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:38 PM;And I love FFX so :P;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:39 PM;"I just really enjoy that statuses are actually usable in DQXI. In most FF games, most bosses are just brute forced which I find to be pretty boring after a while. I like the idea of having to use statuses to deal with tough bosses or mess around with equipment in order to win";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:40 PM;"In most of the FF games, you typically have to find rare equipment that can cast a status on hit, rather than just quickly going to an ability menu and using it that way";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:40 PM;"And unfortunately, FF's random encounters are almost always too easy to bother necessitating any strategy";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:40 PM;Try changing your tactics in FF then if you're tired of Brute forcing;;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:42 PM;"Another thing I like in DQXI is that it allows for burst setups, whereas most FF games don't. The only one I can think of where it does would be FFX with overdrives/aeon overdrives";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:43 PM;Which is less setup and more come in with overdrive gauges full and trivialize the boss if you can't beat it or something;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:44 PM;"Also , , `And unfortunately, FF's random encounters are almost always too easy to bother necessitating any strategy`, , I can say the same about DQ XI, at least early on, where you're defeating enemies in 1-3 hits";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:47 PM;"Oh yeah, normal mode is easy about... 90% of the game, I think? For random encounters. It's a nice, comfortable playthrough that lets you blast through most things and enjoy the story";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;25-Oct-18 05:47 PM;"And so far, I've had no need to strategize against the bosses";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 05:47 PM;Stronger Enemies is a real bitch though;;
Leon#9542;25-Oct-18 06:13 PM;"I found that the difficulty picked up a bit after you get all the party members. It's not like super challenging or anything, but it's certainly been a lot more engaging than those very trivial 15 or so starting hours.";;
Leon#9542;25-Oct-18 06:13 PM;"I do wish they let you toggle Stronger Enemies on mid playthrough tho, I wanna try it but definitely don't feel like starting over just for it.";;
Rasea#1840;25-Oct-18 06:29 PM;"Yeah. Though the idea (I imagine, assuming they weren't lazy about it and it's intentional) is to prevent players from toggling it off before bosses or ones they have trouble with, circumventing difficulty";;
Leon#9542;25-Oct-18 06:48 PM;That makes sense. ~~I'd probably do that.~~;;

qlip#0001;26-Oct-18 04:33 AM;So I just got the sub in ff7. The boss before that made me get over as it killed my entire party in two hits with lapis laser.;;

Rasea#1840;26-Oct-18 04:55 AM;Yep :>;;
Deep#9598;26-Oct-18 04:57 AM;Just try to kill the arms as soon as possible. Trine or Bolt3 are good options;;

Perrydice#9311;26-Oct-18 08:14 AM;@Brion#4623 i like kefka's tower. one of my favorite things of the game... especially because you need to use all your party members except for 2 if you got all 14.;;

ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:06 PM;"Basically, if they did a sequel without involving any of the characters, either by having them only as background characters, or so set so long in the future that they're not alive anymore.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:08 PM;"Well 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 are off the table";;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:08 PM;Why?;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:08 PM;"If you count that one anime as cannon, 5 is as well";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:08 PM;Cause they already have a sequel;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:08 PM;You can still set more.;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:09 PM;All of those except for 12 and the V OAV are still based around existing characters.;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:09 PM;So my question is Which FF world has the best sequel potential omitting the characters.;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:10 PM;"And I guess 13 is out cause that world went boom, and we don't know anything about the earth-like world they move to.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:12 PM;"I would love a full prequel of Laguna and co, along with Lord Braska and co., , As for a sequel, uhhh..";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:15 PM;I'm defaulting to 9;;
Deep#9598;29-Oct-18 03:15 PM;"I'd say IX, since they did go pretty far out in establishing a timeline of events and such, but the plot points are all dealt with by the end of the game. I wouldn't know how they'd handle it";;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:16 PM;Yeah. It'd be interesting to see the medievil styled FFs evolve into modern day.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:16 PM;Just pull an After Years :GWqlabsKek:;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:16 PM;Kinda like what Legend of Korra did for Last Airbender.;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:17 PM;"I mean, I guess Type-0 kinda did that.";;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:17 PM;At least trying to apply crystal lore to a modern-ish world.;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:17 PM;Or at least psue-do modern with the WWII influences.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:32 PM;"And it turns out Mikato is actually evil and wants to take over the world, so the Genomes can live in peace";;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:32 PM;Nah. She wants to take enough souls to figure out why they have tails;;
Deep#9598;29-Oct-18 03:33 PM;I never call her Sarah. I'm way too attached to Garnet;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:33 PM;She's hoping she'll come across Garland's;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:33 PM;Same tbh but that's her real name according to the game :p;;
Deep#9598;29-Oct-18 03:33 PM;It is. Really elaborate way of finding it out;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:34 PM;Unsure what to call her at this point;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:34 PM;The sidequest for finding out Garnet's real name sounds like an urban legend;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:34 PM;It's real;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:34 PM;I know;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:34 PM;And dumb;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:35 PM;That's the crazy part;;

Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:37 PM;That's takes the crown as the dumbest urban legend that turned out to be true for me personally. If you had told me that at the beginning I'd think you're bullshitting me;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:37 PM;But I've seen it. I've seen the achievement and card. It's real. All too real;;
Deep#9598;29-Oct-18 03:37 PM;I think my highest on that minigame was 72;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:38 PM;There's no way anyone on the PS1 got it;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:38 PM;Excalibur 2 also sounds like an urban legend;;

ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:39 PM;Still can't believe people thought that was real...;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:40 PM;What's that;;
Deep#9598;29-Oct-18 03:40 PM;I've never heard of Cheese Sword;;
Waffle#7987;29-Oct-18 03:40 PM;Yeah;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:42 PM;"Its a long and convoluted rumor that I think crosses with some Aerith Ressurection urban legends, but ends in going to the moon to get an ultimate sword made of cheese.";;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 03:52 PM;and a rideable White Chocobo;;
ChipNoir#3597;29-Oct-18 03:52 PM;"Yeah, I confused Sword with WEAPON.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;29-Oct-18 07:17 PM;I also recall you could have Tifa sacrfice herself to save Aerith;;

Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 05:12 PM;That's... a big stretch and also no bearing on gameplay :P;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:12 PM;isn't Auron an Aeon too?;;

ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:16 PM;*Shudder*;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:17 PM;I worry about Nojima working on the VII remake when I think about how he wrote that abomination.;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:22 PM;👀;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:22 PM;"I mean, I guess its possible for Tidus as Final Aeon form to be Leviathan, but the designs for Jecht and Anima are both very reminescent of their original human forms.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:23 PM;So I don't really see how someone like Tidus really translates to a sea serpent.;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:23 PM;Hmmmm;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:23 PM;"Mind you its not a hardset rule, given you can turn into a horse but...";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:23 PM;Just doesn't settle right for me.;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:23 PM;Yah I mean the Bahamut fayth doesn't look very Bahamut ahahh;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:24 PM;But I guess that's sorta the point;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 05:24 PM;Didn't Tidus get blown up in that?;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:24 PM;O.o;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:24 PM;In the novella? Yep.;;

Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:26 PM;I would have laughed it he kicked that boy instead;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:26 PM;Lmao;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:26 PM;I don't think there's much to worry about FF7R;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:26 PM;Snot like they're making a brand new game;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:26 PM;they already have a template laid out;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;"Yeah, but they're also saying nothing is off limits.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;"So if they want to pursue a crazy idea, nothing will stop them.";;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;There are bound to be bits that won't be liked;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;And Nojima can be...odd.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;What else has he worked on?;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;As long as they keep the main story of ff7 the same it'll be largely fine;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;"He's been the scenario writer for most of the FF's that Kitase/Nomura have been involved in, as well as single handedly wrote that stupid novella and audio-play.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:27 PM;So basically if he's given any freedom...he sucks.;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:28 PM;I don't think he'll have complete freedom;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:28 PM;"Nomura isn't exactly known for story coherency either, so it'd kinda be up to Kitase to keep things sane.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:28 PM;Aaaand Kitase let XIII happen so...;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:29 PM;"My guess is they're following the original FFVII story, maybe retconning some things or filling some plot holes the original story had";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:29 PM;^;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:29 PM;"The bones of VII are gonna be there, but I'm expecting a lot of left turns, ala MGS Twin Snakes ...Did that just happen? kinda stuff.";;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:29 PM;"If you want a 1:1 retelling, just replay the game";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:29 PM;My greatest fear is that they may retcon FFVIICC;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:29 PM;The original game will always still be there;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:30 PM;I'm totally on board for any changes. It'll be great discussion material.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:30 PM;Just some might hurt...a lot.;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 05:30 PM;Give us the Amano bike;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:30 PM;Retcon CC in what way exactly?;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:30 PM;Change Zack's story in some way;;
Lapis#3475;30-Oct-18 05:30 PM;Cup noodle billboards on the highway lol;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:31 PM;"I don't think they're going to do that, for better or worse, since so much of CC is neatly tucked away in secrets.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:31 PM;the only thing thats really relevant is deciding which way he dies.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:31 PM;And I think they'll probably go with CC just because its more epic.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:31 PM;This entire trilogy is going to be LOTR's level of showmanship.;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:31 PM;Angeal and Genesis is the two characters that may be forgotten from the FFVIICC story;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:32 PM;"Well to be fair, they're not really relevant, and kinda need to be a secret.";;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 05:33 PM;"Pfft, Genesis";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:33 PM;"Angeal was the original owner of the buster sword, so not that irrelevant. and he gave zack's personality development, which in the end cloud got";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:33 PM;"Angeal is not that irrelevant, genesis is to some extent";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:34 PM;Cloud didn't really get Zack's personality. That's kind of fannon lore.;;
Deep#9598;30-Oct-18 05:34 PM;I'll take a cutscene with Genesis if only to hear that lovely voice again;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:34 PM;"If you put Cloud OG and Zack CC side by side, they don't have a lot in common.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"Cloud has the assumed role, but the persona he develops is more selfish, more arrogant, and a lot less heroic.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"Now if they go full on embrace the FFVIICC story that would be great, even if it's not mentioned in the main story. maybe in lore tidbits or as easter eggs";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;That's true Chip;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;"Oh I'm sure it'll be aesthetically similar, and some hints dropped. We might run into Denzel running around sector 5.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;Its just going to be very VERY peripheral.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;The remake has too much other ground to cover.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:35 PM;Especially part one dealing with fleshing out Avalanche.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:36 PM;"And again, the story of CC is meant to be consumed AFTER VII.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:37 PM;"If they ever want to rerelease it, it'll be after the remake.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:37 PM;"For the player, yeah, but lore-wise is before";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:37 PM;so there can be references to it in the remake;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:38 PM;That'd leave a lot of strange elements hanging about that only people who played a game from over a decade ago would understand.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:38 PM;"I'm not sure anyone at SE would find it worth it. Especially not Nomura, who didn't really have anything to do with the compilation post AC.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:38 PM;CC is Tabata's brain child.;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:38 PM;Not too farfetched to do imo;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:39 PM;"they don't have to include it in the main story, like hidden tidbits scattered around";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:39 PM;Possibly.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:40 PM;"It'd take some finessing, given that'd mean that some things still have to elude the cast since they'd only be revelations later on.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:40 PM;"Suggesting CC was a thing that happened, since like you mentioned. CC is not supposed to be known";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:40 PM;Cloud doesn't really start questioning things till around Junon. That might not even be till part 2.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:40 PM;So that's so far away to think about for me.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:41 PM;I'm adamantly in the camp that's predicting the remake to be at MOST ending at the Junon Ship with the final battle being against JENOVA Birth.;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 05:43 PM;inb4 they pull out the rug from everyone and create an entirely new story with the same characters;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:43 PM;that's entirely within the realm of possibility for SE;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:44 PM;Wouldn't surprise me tbh;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 05:45 PM;"I don't necessarily even see it as a bad thing. My gf would prefer that because everyone already played and loved FF7. HD-ifying it with a new combat system can be something of a waste. Taking a chance on a new story, shit or not, would probably be worth it more";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:46 PM;Eh.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:46 PM;The PSX trailer seems like their way of saying This will still be the same story.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:47 PM;That trailer was beat for beat exactly the timeline of the first hour of the game.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:47 PM;Just a lot of lateral room to expand things.;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:47 PM;.yt FF7 remake PSX;;

ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:47 PM;Well thats a nifty command.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:48 PM;"But yeah. We still have the same course of events. Just little cinematic changes that make things more exciting, like Biggs grappling with the grunt before Jessie kicks him, or how we get to see the direction Barret approaches the group from.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:48 PM;Taking full advantage of a mobile camera that the original game couldn't afford.;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 05:50 PM;Fair enough;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:51 PM;"I agree, it's far to risky for SE to change the story of a widely loved game";;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 05:51 PM;"Though you could argue a FFXV kinda thing. Where they showed stuff that never made it into the game, or drastically dumbed down what you saw because of engine issues";;

ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:52 PM;XV was a trilogy that was ordered to be made into one game to meet a 5 year deadline.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:52 PM;I don't think XV's situation can be applied to VII right now.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:53 PM;We practically have the absolute OPPOSITE situation.;;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:53 PM;how so?;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:53 PM;"Better engine, better director, better time frame, more familiar with the console, etc etc etc.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:53 PM;They both went/are going through a development hell;;
Psychotic Ninja#0661;30-Oct-18 05:54 PM;Inb4 FFVIIR becomes FF XVI;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:54 PM;"Mmm, as far as we know VII's only issue is it lost some momentum when they went internal.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:54 PM;"So, six months of progress lost at most.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:54 PM;We are clocking in at the 3rd year without any news on it. ofc it's going through dev hell;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:55 PM;Square has always been cagey about their releases.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:55 PM;"They've always overextended development, and they've always kept news scarce.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:56 PM;"We're so used to modern gaming news standards where every development gets thrust in the news, but SE has just never played into that.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:56 PM;"We've also gotten tidbits across the months. Nothing huge, but its been better than Versus' early days.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:57 PM;"And again, we were well aware of how problematic Luminous was being. Unreal 4 doesn't provide the same issues. KHIII has been in production...4? 5 years? So why would VII be out sooner?";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:57 PM;"And we didn't get substantial news about KHIII till last year, when promotion began.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 05:58 PM;"That's not entirely true, FFXIV has had a great dev communication with it's players after the 1.0 thing and throughout ARR and onwards. FFXV even at the end of the development cycle copied the live letter formula";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:58 PM;Thats a unique case.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:58 PM;They were trying to fix errors and rewin faith on those two.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:59 PM;"Again, KHIII is coming out with no major issues, and a fairly standard release cycle for what Square usually does.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 05:59 PM;"Sooo if they're using the same director, the same tools, the same resources, and now even the same staff to an extent, I don't see why VII would have issues where KHIII isn't.";;
themockingguy#6969;30-Oct-18 06:02 PM;"I mean, all of this speculation. I choose to believe that the lack of communication and news is because internal issues. Square has seen the advantages of good player communication with FFXIV and even FFXV . seems silly to me at least that they're being silent because it's the SE way";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:06 PM;I just chalk it up to old fashioned sensibilities.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:06 PM;Mixed with this We only spend money with imediate returns everything they focus on is for the fiscal year of release.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:06 PM;Thats why so much effort has been spent on pushing mobile games at these trade shows.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:07 PM;Why spend money to market a game that won't appear till next financial year?;;
Rasea#1840;30-Oct-18 06:21 PM;"Went poof to eat, but anyways. While it would be a better idea, financially, to just do a carbon copy of VII but with modernized stuff, it makes sense to take a risk with a new story. And I can see how people would prefer that";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:24 PM;Totally.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:25 PM;"I wouldn't have anything to speculate over, and I'd be wasting my money if it was too similar.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:25 PM;I've owned the game on nearly console/pc I've had. Don't need another.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:26 PM;"Plus I look at stuff like the Android versions of 1-6, Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana and think ...I don't want that to happen to VII.";;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:26 PM;At least in this situation there's a sense of effort and ambition.;;
ChipNoir#3597;30-Oct-18 06:27 PM;Not Lets hand this over to some low-rent idiots and shit it out for 30 bucks on Google/Apple;;

Deep#9598;02-Nov-18 02:57 PM;"@action warrior#8892 Noel is a hunter. It's what he's known mostly all his life. He's trained under Caius, the villain of the game, whom is the guardian of Yeul, who constantly dies because of the time travel meddling. The main plot of 13-2 is Caius attempting to prevent Yeul from dying all the time. As such, he kind of left Noel behind after spouting some philosophy. Here's the kicker: Noel is the last human in existence. And this is where I personalyl drew the line into dumb territory. He's the last human born, thus humanity's last chance of sustaining itself. He has to deal with fighting his mentor and saving the human race. 13-2 does this well for the most part, but I never found the situation as dire as he made it out to be. As such, I couldn't take it all that seriously. On top of all the time travelling and Caius' sword, anyway. That's just my opinion, , This is unrelated to my point, but of course, Noel being a hunter all of his life, when starting the game, has absolutely no stats or abilities. Great experience he's had";;

Deep#9598;02-Nov-18 03:07 PM;"Yeul is never directly mentioned in 13. A couple of analects in the datalog will mention her name. She's a seeress born before the war of transgression. She can see the future, but she has a short lifespan because of it. She gets reborn all the time, always the same girl, always seeing the future. Because time got messed with, she sees many, many futures, and keeps on dying as a result. Caius, being her guardian, essentially broke from this and vowed to kill Etro in order to seize time and never let Yeul die";;

Perrydice#9311;03-Nov-18 04:54 PM;I like 12 too.;;

assholemon#0823;03-Nov-18 04:55 PM;"because the war about the 2 empires is promising, but they decided to go for the nethecite";;
assholemon#0823;03-Nov-18 04:55 PM;or it took a bigger focus;;
assholemon#0823;03-Nov-18 04:58 PM;"Not a bad thing per say, because certain elements of the story are neat";;
Perrydice#9311;03-Nov-18 04:58 PM;Yeah just keep playing.;;
assholemon#0823;03-Nov-18 04:58 PM;"and i like how the story presents vaan as a main character but then focuses on ashe, balther and the others";;
Perrydice#9311;03-Nov-18 04:59 PM;Yep.;;

Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:27 PM;I'm now in Insomnia in chapter 14 in XV. How exactly did 10 years pass like nothing?;;
Brion#4623;05-Nov-18 02:30 PM;"so they could have a post/presently-apocalyptic atmosphere for a final show down. ff6 did it, but only a year";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:31 PM;Why =/= how :P;;
Brion#4623;05-Nov-18 02:32 PM;"oh, well, how is way easier. because that's how they programmed it";;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:34 PM;I can get behind some fiery post-apocalypse for a final showdown. I'm just wondering how going inside a crystal somehow warps me 10 years ahead to a location that I couldn't visit before yet no sense of time seemed to have taken place for Noctis;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:36 PM;"So I had to look it up because I wasn't sure for the reason. Evidently he just kinda sleeps in it for ten years, absorbing all the magical energies of the Crystal in order to basically power up to a level where he can take on Ardyn";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:39 PM;It's also used as a plot device so that he can man up and change his physical appearance as well;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:41 PM;"See, I would believe that he powered up, except the very last thing I just did was run into a sudden Omega who'd decided to dimension hop into Insomnia, and my attacks did no damage and I got destroyed";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:45 PM;"I cannot comment on that, unfortunately, since I played the launch version of the game";;
Brion#4623;05-Nov-18 02:45 PM;"i wasn't a big fan of the time skipping. the way the game had gone, it felt like it really didn't need to jump 10 years to accomplish that setting. and that 10 years in that kind of a world would absolutely eradicate humanity. i really love the ending though";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:46 PM;"Eh, I like time skips generally. I particularly like the one for Noctis so he could man up and become a protagonist (for like the 2-3 hours of gameplay that exists there) that I genuinely liked";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:46 PM;Rather than whiney Noctis;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:47 PM;"Also didn't necessarily need the time skip for the ruined world thing. DQXI does that at the halfway point fantastically and has a lot of plot and character growth revolving around it. You get to actually be in it, rather than it being a short lived plot device which you barely get to experience";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:47 PM;"But the whole ruined world thing just kinda came with the time skip since, you know, Noctis poofed for ten years and no one could stand up to Ardyn";;
Brion#4623;05-Nov-18 02:55 PM;"time skipping is fine. 2 of the best games ever used it (ff6, ocarina of time). it's just that 10 years seems excessive. ardyn and his daemons would have taken over pretty much immediately and have been much more devastating in that time";;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:55 PM;"I haven't beaten it yet, but I've found this game's pacing to be all over the place";;
Brion#4623;05-Nov-18 02:55 PM;yeah the plot revelations and pacing are noted problems;;
Brion#4623;05-Nov-18 02:55 PM;and i like the game;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:56 PM;One chapter ends simply by driving to a place;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:56 PM;It is quite all over the place;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:56 PM;And yet chapter 13 is too long with a dumb corridor facility search thing;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 02:57 PM;"And that's not what Ardyn wants. He wants to subjugate the world so that he can be king, which is why he conquered it rather than destroying everything. He also wants to kill Noctis because of his vendetta against the family line. So he wouldn't destroy everything until he's killed Noctis";;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 02:59 PM;"I don't know why you'd want that when there are bombs, giant hunks of metals with cleavers and evil samurais everywhere";;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 03:00 PM;"Subjugate the world, when it's in eternal darkness and filled with monsters. Wonderful";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 03:00 PM;That is his subjugation :P;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 03:00 PM;Congratulations?;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 03:01 PM;"He can never be king because the Crystal won't accept him, so he just used the power of darkness to subjugate everything";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 03:01 PM;Tyrant is the next best thing;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 03:02 PM;How exactly did he do this? Maybe a cutscene will explain it but;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 03:02 PM;He didn't have hordes of imperials behind him;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 03:04 PM;He is extremely powerful. He's got an affinity for the dark arts. So it's assumed he created or summoned loads of evil minions and they obey his command since he's kind of a dark lord type deal;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 03:04 PM;His power is why Noctis had to absorb the energies of the Crystal for a decade to take him on;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 03:05 PM;And also (plot wise) why he had to gain the power of the thirteen arms;;
Deep#9598;05-Nov-18 03:05 PM;I see;;

Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 05:46 PM;"Anyways, Lord Jyscal is the father of Seymour. He was the previous leader of the Guado. IIRC somehow responsible for bringing them together as a people., , The Farplane is FFX's afterlife. Pyreflies are things made of energy, containing memories and a person's being. When someone dies, they become pyreflies. These pyreflies must be sent (what Yuna does) so that they may find rest at the Farplane. When pyreflies aren't allowed to rest, they gather and become monsters. Released once again when killed (as you may notice in combat)., , You also visited a small area in Guadosalam that allowed your party to use their memories of people, causing the pyreflies to gather and show an image of the person they were thinking of and talk to them";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 06:26 PM;That’s because you live in a backwards state;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 06:26 PM;"But anyways, uh, Sigils are used for celestial weapons. Which are ultimate weapons for each character in the postgame";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 07:21 PM;That’s why I said you live in a backwards state.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 07:21 PM;Ok so the celestial weapons are not a big deal for the main story?;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 07:22 PM;Side note. It says I’ve played 15 hours so far. Does that sound right?;;

Thelitedragon#4507;05-Nov-18 08:37 PM;Yes it is;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 08:38 PM;What’s so tough about it?;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;05-Nov-18 08:50 PM;dodging 200 in a row;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;05-Nov-18 08:50 PM;not that hard tbh;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 08:59 PM;Disregarding opinions;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 09:00 PM;"It's tough because it takes 20 minutes to dodge all 200. You have to do them in a row. So if you dodge 183 and mess up the 184th, the counter resets to 0 and you get to start all over again";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 09:00 PM;"That being said, there's a little trick you can do that makes it easy, but you can still mess it up";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Nov-18 09:01 PM;also if you don't have a TV/Monitor with low input lag that makes it even harder;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Nov-18 09:02 PM;than it was back when everyone was playing it on CRTs;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;05-Nov-18 09:06 PM;that celestial weapon is worthless compared to the amount of frustration there is;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 09:08 PM;That won't really be an issue;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:17 PM;"Yeah I’m just doing main story this time around. Any side quests I run into and feel like doing, I’ll do.";;

Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:20 PM;We are in spoilers so it’s all good.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:21 PM;I have issues as well. Curious as to what yours are.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 09:22 PM;"It takes too long to be able to mess around with materia, a main selling point that people often parrot as to why you should play the game., Aerith is one of my favorite characters, I dislike that there's no way to save her. You just have to accept she died. It's a heartwrenching event and well done, but doesn't mean I have to like it., It's way too easy, relegated to an attack fest., Characters are defined by their limit breaks, meaning no one's really unique., A really underwhelming postgame., Some materia in the game come in far too late for them to even matter";;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:23 PM;Definitely agree on the materia issue. Really cool idea that just doesn’t come to fruition until too late in the game.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:23 PM;I can’t speak to the postgame since I didn’t do it.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:24 PM;I do like that characters aren’t unique and that you can kind of create a job system and assign anyone to said jobs.;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:26 PM;I’ll also agree it’s too easy. I only died twice. Once to the midgar zolom because I wanted to see what the little caterpillar thing was... and to emerald weapon because I just had to see what the fuss was all about.;;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 09:26 PM;"I'm fine with the line blurring between characters for uniqueness. FFV did that, but there, it's an investment. If you started to turn Bartz into a white mage that can summon things while also having !Gaia for MP conservation, it felt like it meant something., , Being able to juggle materia around just made whoever you used meaningless unless you used them for their limit breaks";;
Rasea#1840;05-Nov-18 09:27 PM;Which also meant that you don't use characters/characters suck based on their limit breaks if you cared about that kind of thing. No such issue in FFV;;
Santa Filthy Casual#9506;05-Nov-18 09:27 PM;That’s fair.;;

Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 04:55 PM;"Spoiler: Describing pretty much what I know about Final Fantasy XIII., , Vanille: That's the French word for Vanilla, which means to be ordinary and lacking distinction or an ice-cream flavour. Vanille's character is anything but ordinal, she has a personalty that just pops and letting everyone else think she's very cheery. But she's only kidding herself., Snow: That's the ice crystals that comes from the clouds, it's beautiful to some and annoying to most. You can say that Snow is a mask that the sky wears for when the cloud is actually crying. That is exactly what symbolizes Snow as a character, he's truly hurt on the inside, but it's hidding it all with the hero act., Lightning: That bolt of electrostatic discharge that strikes from the clouds. Lightning has already told us why she went with that name within the game, but you can probably guess that it was just to show that she needed to take charge and to hide her weakness and insecurities., Hope: Another word for desire and expectations within something or someone else, ultimately trust. Hope truly has trust issues, within Snow after what he has witness, so his expectation of Snow isn't too high. You can say he has lost hope in Snow., , There are more characters with deeper meanings, but these will have to do for now. As you can tell, each character has something they are battling within themselves and you can say that it becomes their Focus within the game.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 04:55 PM;"For the Focus that they have witness from Anima at the beginning of the game, it was nothing but a memory of past events. The fal'Cie only wanted history to repeat itself and replayed a memory to the Warriors of Light. , It was actually a past event that involved Vanille and Fang. Vanille didn't point it out because she was still trapped in her emotion of turning Sazh's son into a l'Cie, you will soon find that majority of the characters only focusing on one emotion and simply ignoring everything else., Like how Lightning only cares about getting her sister Serah back, but doesn't really care about anything else and disregard it as a nuisance, such as not accepting Snow as her brother-in-law. Later in the game she changes her point of view on things and has accepted it., Hope, during the majority of the first half of the game is only concerned about the lost trust he has in Snow. Nothing to him matters either. See how this is a recurring theme, but it was intentional, just to show how one emotion can truly dominate your life and that you are ultimately just a pet to your emotion., , During a point within the game, Lightning realizes that they are merely pets to the fal'Cie. Toys and puppets being controlled. No longer does the Focus matter, it was a game of war between Pulse and Sanctum and they were just pawns on a chessboard. , They all soon realize that they would all have to settle these emotions that are tying them down to actually see their true focus; to protect the humans of Cocoon., , Well, that's my take on it anyways.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 04:57 PM;"My take on it: 50+ hours of run forward and fight, run forward and fight, run forward and fight, cutscene and Cocoon's enemies, rinse and repeat.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 04:58 PM;"Yeah, the game truly did a terrible job at the storytelling part. Probably summarized it as, a bunch of alcoholic came into a sessions to sort out their problems.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:00 PM;"The cutscenes were really well done though, it was the key moments in each character's plot.";;

Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:02 PM;The story may not seem all emotional due to all the running and fighting that is so repetitive in the game.;;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:02 PM;Pretty much just out shadowed everything else in the game.;;

Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:15 PM;"That is true, Final Fantasy X is linear, and may I even add that, I'm like almost certain, the map designer for Final Fantasy XIII is the very same for Final Fantasy X.";;

Deep#9598;06-Nov-18 05:16 PM;"It's compared that way because of how egregious it is. I look at IX and see that it's highly linear with minimal side content along the path. XIII didn't offer much off the beaten path, nor traditional towns and shops, nor did it have any NPCs. It didn't have many break times either, just point A to point B constantly";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:18 PM;"Final Fantasy XIII didn't have an world map, you got from point A to B with loading. It was the same for Final Fantasy X. Because it was the very same person who made it. As for side content, that's some other person's business.";;

Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:21 PM;I don't have an issue with the linearity.;;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:21 PM;"But even so, Final Fantasy XIII is a game beyond all the Final Fantasy titles that has such in depth story that it has to tell.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:21 PM;"In fact, some of my favorite games are extremely linear.";;
Perrydice#9311;06-Nov-18 05:22 PM;@Silverx1987#9781 my issue with XIII when it comes to story and gameplay has always been pacing. I haven't really changed on that opinion much.;;
Deep#9598;06-Nov-18 05:26 PM;"I don't have a problem with how linear XIII is. My problems lie with the equipment setup and upgrade system, the slow battle system in the first half due to the low amounts of ATB, some enemy health spikes and the poor implementation of gil";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:28 PM;"For me, I would have enjoyed it more if they forego the equipment and upgrade system until a later time. The progression system was linear until a certain point in the game (which I don't mind), but would ultimately made it seem to most people like a tutorial they were following along.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:31 PM;"Like having the upgrade system unlock when you arrived at Gran Pulse, although that still probably wouldn't help much. But if they didn't include it in, would just make everything even more linear without a form of customization.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:33 PM;"I mean, like the player has no choice in the matter of what their character are using. But in the end, it's just one of those games that much of the systems conflicted with one another.";;
Deep#9598;06-Nov-18 05:33 PM;"Honestly, crystarium getting blocked off didn't mean all that much throughout until the end of Gran Pulse. The CP requirements for the level above were too much to grind out to take advantage of";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:35 PM;Each character only had three different roles unlocked to them. Each path would be content-blocked. Only until Gran Pulse where the entire system became available.;;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:36 PM;"I don't think the CP grind was that tedious, I believe they purposely set it up so that if you battled with every enemy within the map before moving forward, you would be on the money.";;
Deep#9598;06-Nov-18 05:36 PM;"The roles first became available in the chapter before, the Ark chapter. But the CP amounts to get those other roles up cost too much for the enemies at that point to get much use from";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:38 PM;"So in a sense, that was pretty much their way of dealing with exploration. There were treasure chests in different locations. If you wanted them, you'd go exploring. There are some areas that aren't necessarily linear paths and have forks to battle other enemies and grab treasure.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:40 PM;"But this also means that it involves quite a bit of back tracking, but still, some areas would have a way to put you back on the right track. So it's like pseudo-linearity.";;
Silverx1987#9781;06-Nov-18 05:41 PM;"This way, so there's truly isn't a dead end.";;
Deep#9598;06-Nov-18 05:41 PM;Fighting everything along the way most times maxes out your crystarium levels for the chapter;;

Deep#9598;11-Nov-18 08:18 AM;"They were spooky because they were the hardest enemies in the game, especially the long gui. It can nuke your party as soon as the battle begins if you go in unprepared.  Uses ultima and a move called Bay that really screws over your buffs. The one in XV simply stood still and occasionally moved its large head around that might have hit you. Doesn't inflict statuses, doesn't get any buffs. No last resort big moves that can turn the battle in its favour. Just a huge damage sink that takes about 40 minutes to wittle down";;

Sora asks if Donald & Goofy saw the hooded figure (Roxas) but they say that they saw no one., , As for why Roxas attacks Sora, two reasons., First one being that he's pissed about what happened to Axel, his best friend., Second one being that Roxas is testing Sora, making sure he can hold his own against the coming darkness. This is signified by the ending of the fight where Roxas says You make a good other. and disappears with a satisfied look on his face";;

FireProne#0537;05-Dec-18 05:14 AM;"I finished ffvi and what an amazing game, I played the snes version so there was minor bugs and the translation was awful thanks to Ted. But looking past all that I can see why the game is so praised. There were some times where the grinding was a little tedious when it came to getting rages, but I didn't really complain because during that time I was gaining new magic abilities while I was trying to run into certain monsters. Also I found it funny how the game was so broken at times you can use it to your advantage, aka evasion bug and aka vanish and doom bug lol. But I didn't really use the doom bug because that would just kill the experience, overall the story was amazing, to jumping on the phantom train, to the spectacular opera scene, to finding all the characters in wor and to know their backstories, to killing the 3 powerful monsters and kefka at the end. Eventually I will probably replay it on the gba to check out the extra summons and dungeons. 10/10";;

Izwar Vain#5689;07-Dec-18 10:45 PM;I'd think so;;

They are weapons. They are legendary. There are even twelve of them.";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 10:53 PM;"As for that bit, I actually have an answer for that... let me find it";;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 10:54 PM;So far earily decision its Vaan: Shikaro/Forebreak  balthier Uhlan/Machinist  Fran: Red Battlemage/archer  Basch: Knight/Bushi  Penelo: Black mage/monk Ashe: Whitemage/Time battlemage;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 10:54 PM;thoughts?;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 10:57 PM;orginal i was thinking Ashe: White mage/Knight but not sure if that is a good idea;;
Izwar Vain#5689;07-Dec-18 10:57 PM;"Yep, not a good idea at all";;
Izwar Vain#5689;07-Dec-18 10:58 PM;"My white mage was too busy healing, so she (Penelo) couldn't attack";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 10:58 PM;"If you want to be all optimal about it and still retain the 12 job party thing, then:, , Vaan - Knight/Bushi, Balthier - Shikari/Foebreaker, Basch - Uhlan/Time Battlemage, Fran - Archer/Red Battlemage, Ashe - Monk/Black Mage, Penelo - White Mage/Machinist., , In that order. Meaning the second job is the one you'll pick up once you defeat Ifrit";;
Izwar Vain#5689;07-Dec-18 10:59 PM;"Then again, a beefy white mage seems pretty neat... I honestly don't know 😂";;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:00 PM;really optimal other than white mage the other magic jobs is 2nd?;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:01 PM;"Yeah. You don't need any of the utility or weakness targeting bits of the magic classes until after Ifrit, so it won't impact you getting them later on";;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:02 PM;orginally i started with Vaan with Shirari and Penelo white mage but ended up then got stucck once Baltheir and Fran joined;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:06 PM;@Rasea#1840  what about quickening spots and espers? Which one would go with each of those combos?;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:13 PM;"Sorry, having to re-find the information and all that since it's been a while. Anyways., , Vaan - Belias, Exodus, Hashmal, Mateus, Ultima, Balthier - Adrammelech, Zalera, Basch - None, Fran - Cuchulainn, Shemhazai, Zeromus, Ashe - Chaos, Zodiark, Penelo - Famfrit";;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:14 PM;really non on basch?;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:14 PM;"Assuming you go with his combo listed above, nope. That being said, you can take the espers that don't really give anything useful overall and stick them on Basch if you want him to have an esper or two";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:16 PM;"As for quickenings, from what I recall, none of them matter as long as you go with the aforementioned combos. As the entire purpose of getting the quickenings & espers (aside from their immediate use) is to unlock islands you wouldn't have access to otherwise due to the connecting job boards";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:17 PM;"The exception to this is Shikari. You want the 50 LP (Ninja Swords 1), 100 LP (Ninja Swords 3) and 125 LP (Orochi/Yagyu) quickenings. Ninja Swords 2 is crap compared to 3 (as you have to choose between two or three)";;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:17 PM;knight with Excalibur too?;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:18 PM;or would knight get it anyways regardless of qucikening?;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:20 PM;"Yeah, you want the 125 LP quickening for that. You can get it with the 125 LP quickening/Chaos esper/Zodiac esper. Both of those are late af, so you go for the quickening. Generally speaking, the quickenings are very easy to spot on which ones to take., , You go for the ones that are on a choke point. AKA the ones that would prevent you from getting to the licenses past it. You can ignore the ones that are just a tile jutting out that don't block off anything";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:20 PM;"Until you need to get them, anyways";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:22 PM;;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287038550501883904/520832540110487562/unknown.png;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:23 PM;"Good example. This is the Knight board., , The LP 50 Mist (quickening) is one that's jutting out. That's not a priority, you can get it at any time without sacrificing anything., The LP 125 Mist, however, blocks off those three tiles. So you'll want to get that without wasting espers";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;07-Dec-18 11:23 PM;I hate how the yagyu darkblade is locked behind an esper on the licence board;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;07-Dec-18 11:23 PM;fuck that;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:25 PM;"It isn't, though. LP 125 Mist locks off the Yagyu Darkblade. On TZA, anyways";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;07-Dec-18 11:25 PM;oh;;
Doctor_Vile#6548;07-Dec-18 11:25 PM;well still;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:26 PM;"And as long as you only get Ninja Swords 1 and 3 (50 and 100 Mist respectively), you can get the Mist 125 for the Yagyu Darkblade";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:26 PM;"What *does* suck is that if you don't know that, you can never get it because the 125 Mist is the __only__ way to access it. Would really like it if there was a way to get there via an esper";;

Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:29 PM;"Yeah. It's not a huge blow to Shikari or anything, just feels shitty to be locked out of Shikari's best weapon";;

soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:31 PM;what is shikaris best weapon;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:31 PM;ah nvm;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:36 PM;i figure wiht quickenings you want the one that benfits the combo the most;;
Izwar Vain#5689;07-Dec-18 11:36 PM;"My only mistake was on the very first esper choice, after that I carefully planned my placements";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:37 PM;"Correction: it is the second best ninja sword in the game in the Zodiac versions. The license unlocks both the Yagyu Darkblade and the Mesa., The Yagyu Darkblade has 80 attack, 20% evasion and 22% combo rate with the ability to cast Doom on hit., The Mesa has 102 attack, 32% evasion and a 32% combo rate with the ability to inflict Poison on hit";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:38 PM;And you get the quickenings in order no matter which of the four tiles you choose. Lv1 -> lv2 -> lv3;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:38 PM;is it better to get lore than HP?;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:39 PM;And the very first choice is Belias who basically doesn't unlock anything worthwhile for anyone so it's kind of impossible to mess that one up;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:40 PM;"Like, on the job boards in general? You want HP pretty much always over the lores. You need lores to do damage, cast spells and equip equipment. But ideally you want to get HP so that you don't die easily. Particularly for the weaker classes";;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:41 PM;yea;;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:42 PM;"But you usually get the HP lores as you go along with the other lores. Though some are stuck at the end of long pathways, and usually worth prioritizing over equipment licenses as you get equipment upgrades relatively slowly";;
Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:42 PM;Like uh... let me find an example;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:42 PM;white mage/machinast is what i am looking iat;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:43 PM;it has HP HP battle lore nothing for white match then none none none magic lore x3;;
soundersfan84#8550;07-Dec-18 11:44 PM;i was thinking forgoing the first HP so i can get the magic lore 3x later;;

Rasea#1840;07-Dec-18 11:46 PM;"There, in the bottom left are a cluster of HP lores. It's a good idea to shoot for those ASAP on your White Mage/Machinist combo because a big reason you pick the combo is for the HP boost to white mage that they normally wouldn't have";;

Obsidian#1900;08-Dec-18 12:08 AM;Q.Q I remember cheesing the Arena water dragon easily and I thought it was because he was undead but apparently hes not anymore;;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:14 AM;"The arena one never was, the story one was always undead";;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:14 AM;They use the same model;;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:15 AM;"As for lores, they don't quite work like that";;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:16 AM;"Normally, the way the dual boards work is that if you get one tile on one board, it also gets it on another board. This allows you to perform island hopping via specific quickenings, espers or just standard tiles";;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:16 AM;"So if you got Accessory 6 on Machinist, you'd also have it on White Mage";;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:17 AM;"However, for battle lores & magic lores, they add up constantly";;
soundersfan84#8550;08-Dec-18 12:19 AM;but for white mage/machinist   3 quick is battle lore  for white  4 quick is magic lore x3 for machinist;;
soundersfan84#8550;08-Dec-18 12:20 AM;was mostly asking which one of the two to go with;;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:20 AM;"Yeah, you ignore battle lores for the White Mage/Machinist combo and go for the magic lores";;
Rasea#1840;08-Dec-18 12:22 AM;"They're the most important. The two main reasons you pick up Machinist for White Mage is, 1) More HP lores (mentioned earlier), 2) Access to ranged weaponry, which helps them stay at range and lessen the chances of them being hit. Guns & bombs also can hit flying targets and also ignore defense (but is fixed damage so it won't be high damage). Along with the ability to use ailment inducing ammo";;

Rasea#1840;17-Dec-18 11:34 PM;"You can actually spawn her once you leave the Mythril Mines and head towards Junon, as forests initially have a 1/8th chance of a random encounter being her instead";;
Rasea#1840;17-Dec-18 11:35 PM;That chance gets higher as you progress through the game;;
Rasea#1840;17-Dec-18 11:35 PM;Managed it on my second random encounter near Fort Condor iirc;;
galaxy87654321#2182;17-Dec-18 11:36 PM;Hopefully on disc 2 it should be pretty high;;

galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 02:42 AM;Wait the scene in FFXV where ghost Luna summons all the gods to help out noctis and crew was only in the royal edition?;;
galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 02:44 AM;"Damn no wonder people disliked it, seems like most of the parts I enjoyed were added later";;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 02:50 AM;"Yeah. Royal Edition was effectively DLC. It allowed people to get a complete, up to date version of the game that skipped it on account of this game is hot garbage (which was true) as people told them. If you already owned it, you could buy the Royal Pack to access all the Royal Edition specific features (hence effectively being DLC)";;
galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 02:53 AM;So the reason I thought it was pretty good besides a fair amount of flaws is just stuff included in the royal edition;;
galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 02:56 AM;That and I heard chapter 13 is even worse than it already is and it's still pretty bad;;

galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 02:57 AM;I don't know why it auto corrected to is;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 02:57 AM;"Yeah. There aren't any critical features in the Royal Edition, however. It includes..., -Insomnia City Ruins dungeon (Joker mentioned this when he said sold more of Insomnia through the Royal Edition), -Controllable royal vessel that allows the player to explore on the water while adding new fish & dishes, -Armiger Unleashed ability that is unlocked by equipping a hidden accessory found after acquiring all royal arms, -First person camera mode, -All previously available DLC from the season pass, and more DLC in the form of weapons, Regalia skins and item sets, -Archive to view world lore and learn previously unknown lore, -Regalia Type-D (the off-road Regalia truck), -More trophies & achievements";;

galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 02:59 AM;Yeah like I had no idea that noctis's injury as a child prevented him from reaching full power until I read the codex or whatever it's called in this game;;
galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 03:00 AM;They never say that anywhere else;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:06 AM;Yeap. The real kicker were the patches over time that added in a lot of crucial things;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:14 AM;How dare they support the game after release and listen to community feedback :GWqlabsKek:;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:15 AM;"Among many small things, the big things were, -Ability to shop from the Regalia (including a MP3 player that let the player listen to music outside the Regalia), -Galleries for fish & recipes (none existed in the launch version so you had no way to check which ones you did and did not have), -New Game Plus, -Out of battle warping (not in the launch game, which meant people like me were literally locked out of items because they were unreachable without this feature), -An assload of cutscenes throughout the game, including a different ending), -An archive to view world lore, including previously unknown lore, -Regalia Type-D (off-road truck Regalia) that even has a funny jump feature and, if you jump high enough, your crew will pose in slow motion, -Aranea Highwind as a playable character, -Harder difficulty modes, -A bestiary (they took nine fucking months to release this) which shows enemy stats & drop info, -Chapter selection feature after the game has been beaten, -Ability to take on up to ten hunts at once instead of one hunt at a time, -Ability to switch to your other party members and not be forced to play as Noctis all the time, -Ability to fast forward the time of day for hunt conditions and doing so no longer affects the time limit on food buffs, -Massive boost to rewards for killing enemies with the Armiger Chain (went from 100 XP and 1-2 AP to 3000 XP and 20 AP)";;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:15 AM;Took a while to read through all the patch notes;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:15 AM;"And no, Caius. I'm standing my ground on this. You don't continue to support a game. You fix bugs and deal with issues. You don't fuck a game's development and add important content to it for *two fucking years* afterwards that really should've been in the game and **important gameplay features**";;

galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 03:16 AM;Also wow after hearing that change list no wonder FFXV got slammed so hard;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:17 AM;"Yeah, that's not counting all the events, small bits and plethora of bug fixes that I didn't mention";;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:20 AM;A lot of content like the Bestiary and stuff is additional content that is great to have as extra even after release some of the most loved FF games don't have it or some of the listed stuff but it's only bad that it was added later as it was XV lol;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:21 AM;Because they were old games that didn't have the tech for it;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:21 AM;"Or a feature that wasn't a common one. Once some time had passed, bestiaries became standard in basically every RPG";;

NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:23 AM;All those changes to FFXV;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:23 AM;And none makes me think the combat is not donkey-dick;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:24 AM;"Yeap, it's still easy af";;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:24 AM;"Lmao, which reminds me";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:24 AM;"Noctis probably still controls like a truck, has almost no options, and I'm sure asking a partner to do a skill still locks your controls out";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:24 AM;I suppose ?;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:24 AM;They actually *nerfed* a powerful bow-tech combo that you could abuse for high damage with Ignis;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:24 AM;Who nerfs shit in a single player game;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:25 AM;Depends on what it is;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:25 AM;I don't know what that combo is so I won't talk about it;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:25 AM;But it's been done for years;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:26 AM;Many games have had nerfs and buffs between releases in different regions;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:26 AM;You wouldn't believe how violently Yojimbo was buffed in FFX between the NA PS2 release and the EU release;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:26 AM;"And thus all other releases after, which use the EU (International) version as base";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:26 AM;He went from utter garbage to I can set up Zanmato to work half the time for 8 gil on anything;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:27 AM;I'm fine with buffs. Buffs are fun and make the player feel more powerful. Nerfs just feel like shit and can invalidate entire strategies;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:27 AM;Yeah but some of those entire strategies are utter garbage that invalidate the entire gameplay;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:27 AM;Do you think a devs would want that in a game ?;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:27 AM;Or exploit a broken part of the game;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:27 AM;So ofc it gets patched lol;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:27 AM;Not necessarily;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:28 AM;Some devs find exploitable stuff and leave it in because it *opens up* stuff to do;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:28 AM;Sometimes it just shuts down the gameplay from how broken it is;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:28 AM;It's a case-by-case thing;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:28 AM;And sometimes;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:28 AM;Well they don't patch it because it's not worth making a patch *just* for it;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:28 AM;I meant on the specific example;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:29 AM;Well the FFXV example I know nothing about;;
galaxy87654321#2182;23-Dec-18 03:29 AM;Like how the capcom discovered enemy juggling in devil may cry 1 and kept it as a series feature;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:30 AM;"But anyways, to expand on that combo., Bow of the Clever - a royal arm you could find. It's a crossbow that lets you shoot piercing bolts while moving about the battlefield. Used Noctis's magic stat to formulate its damage., , Ignis's Overwhelm technique (special moves) - focuses the entire party on a single target and increases the damage your allies do during that time., , The technique also gave Bow of the Clever a high fire rate (maybe Overwhelm just buffed Noctis's attack speed, which in turn made the crossbow shoot rapidly?). So using that basically gave Noctis a really high damage output. But Royal Arms also come with the downside of draining a bit of health on __every__ attack so you could kill yourself if you weren't careful";;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:30 AM;The glitch also made every bolt a crit;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:31 AM;Guess they didn't like the player doing a lot of damage or something ¯\_(ツ)_/¯;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:31 AM;Because it wasn't meant to work that way lol;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:31 AM;Where's the glitch exactly tho ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:31 AM;The crit part ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:32 AM;The fire rate ?;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:33 AM;Can you still force party members to use two tech skills at once? :trolltabata:;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:33 AM;Iunno about the nerf specifically. It's just stated the combination of Bow of the Clever + Overwhelm was made significantly slower;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:33 AM;So maybe they nerfed the fire rate or something?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:34 AM;"So what, the fire rate was a glitch ?";;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:34 AM;"I imagine it was the fire rate, because the weapon damage was balanced to the fire rate";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:34 AM;Or did the skill explicitly said it increased fire rate ?;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:34 AM;"That's a really petty nerf, depending on how *actually* strong that was";;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:35 AM;Well it would stack 9999s at rapid fire;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:35 AM;The skill didnt increase speed or anything;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:35 AM;It only happened in that situation;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:36 AM;"I hate it when games have damage caps so low that suddenly, at some point, multi-hit stuff becomes absurdly dominant";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:36 AM;It's one of the many reasons I consider FF12TZA way more balanced than the original;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:36 AM;But so many games do that anyway;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:36 AM;I'm reminded of FFX turning Anima's overdrive from 2 hits to 16 hits;;
Caius#6568;23-Dec-18 03:36 AM;All about the Bushi baby;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:36 AM;"Mmmmmmm, so good";;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:37 AM;Was that an International Version change ?;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:37 AM;Yeap;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:37 AM;hUH;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:37 AM;So Yojimbo wasn't the only buffed Aeon;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:38 AM;"Yeah, there's a lot of changes from the normal one to the International version";;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:38 AM;Magus Sisters' Delta Attack was also changed from 1 hit to 6 hits;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:40 AM;Yeah I know;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:40 AM;I never touched the normal FFX;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:40 AM;Since I played the EU version all those years ago;;
Rasea#1840;23-Dec-18 03:41 AM;Ah 🤔;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:45 AM;It's only recently that I've seen the more... subtle changes between the versions;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:45 AM;When I went to take a look at the exact workings of Yojimbo;;
NijiBashira/虹柱#7292;23-Dec-18 03:45 AM;And saw how stupidly OP he's become in International;;

Caius#6568;25-Dec-18 08:12 AM;But the FFXIII specific main villain is Barthandelus and Orphan;;
Caius#6568;25-Dec-18 08:13 AM;Orphan assimilates the prior who controls cocoon through his human form which is like the pope or some shit;;
Caius#6568;25-Dec-18 08:14 AM;"Essentially the cocoon Fal'cie, who provide for life on cocoon, want to return to their maker who is essentially God (Bhunivelze)";;
Caius#6568;25-Dec-18 08:15 AM;To do this they have to cause a cataclysmic event known as Ragnarok;;

FireProne#0537;30-Dec-18 07:04 AM;"I finished ffviii and I personally enjoyed it, I honestly don't see all the hate tbh, yeah the draw system can be a little tedious but I got so use to it that it didn't really bug me at all. Especially since when you're maxed out you don't have to worry about drawing for a good while. The ending was cool too, I was more satisfied beating omega weapon than Ultimecia because I knew she was gonna be pretty easy, but I was still satisfied none the less didn't expect her to blow up like that. The ending cutscene is also nice. Overall great game. One thing I wished to know though is if Squall and Laguna ever talk about Raine after all that has transpired, because it's pretty clear Laguna is Squalls father. With all the hints dropped through out the game. But yeah I'll just assume they did talk about it.";;

DrakeChandler#0072;01-Jan-19 09:47 AM;"A couple days ago I beat FFVI (GBA) and now I've started to play FFIV (DS). I'm already enjoying IV more, but I don't know how much of my enjoyment is from aspects of the original IV and how much is from the remake. The top notch voice acting and consistent older dialect help for the immersion, but those are of course new qualities. But the story feels so perfectly paced and tight. I cried in VI when Cid died and Celes jumped from the cliff. I laughed when everyone went shopping with Gau. Relm ended up being my favorite character and I felt awful as she cried to Strago (in her flashback) about her daddy (Shadow/Clyde) leaving. But VI still felt unfocused to me and it felt like whole scenes were sometimes missing. Like Cyan's family is already dead before you ever see them; and Terra just suddenly found love and adopted a family over the time skip. These are great arcs on paper, and the writing was good enough that I recognized what the characters were going through, but I lacked empathy in some scenes where I thought I should. If VI does ever get remade, I hope it's as good as IV's remake.";;
DrakeChandler#0072;01-Jan-19 09:50 AM;I wasn't too fond of them teasing Terra's death at the end either and then not commiting to it. Almost makes me glad I killed Shadow on the Floating Continent by accident so that I could have some personal investment in killing Kefka.;;

Hell, I beat all the endgame bosses too never worrying about my stats. If you do all the sidequests, you'll naturally have most of your party ready to take on anything. I think the real grind of the game isn't from the magicite, but the fact that you can have up to 14 characters and almost all of them have to be used at some point to achieve something no matter how underleveled they are. It's kind of pain to make sure everyone is as even as you can get them.";;

pokemongenius#1474;01-Jan-19 07:11 PM;Take away that second griever junction for broken up form. 3rd form once defeated loses its tail then you must defeat it again. Although if you do enough damage in the first section you can skip straight to the final form I believe.;;
DrakeChandler#0072;01-Jan-19 09:07 PM;"I was one of those people to break VIII at the very beginning of the game, so Ultimecia was a cakewalk. I don't remember her having five forms, so pokemongenius might be right.";;
