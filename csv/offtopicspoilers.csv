!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:21 PM;you forgot the 19th frame where Ann turns into a static splash image;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:23 PM;With a moving mouth superimposed;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:23 PM;Kinda like they just ripped the image from the game ü§î;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:24 PM;I guess that's what happens when the budget of each episode is $100;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:25 PM;"I swear, each Persona 3 movie had a budget larger than the total budget for the Persona 4 and 5 animations combined";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:27 PM;they should bring back the ones that did that or P4's series;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:27 PM;because P4 the Golden Animation was a dud;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:27 PM;and now this one is as well;;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:27 PM;"they're all by the same studio, it's just A1 has really inconsistent quality";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:28 PM;that's very unfortunate then;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:28 PM;means there's no hope for the future games to come;;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:29 PM;"the anime cutscenes in 5 were done by IG, who are really great, and I was hoping they'd be brought on to do the actual anime too, but nope";;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:29 PM;"Ah, the Persona movies were made by AIC instead";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:30 PM;"just the first one for 3, rest were done by A1";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:31 PM;"though they do hire a lot of freelance staff, so it's very possible they pulled some people from AIC for their movies";;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:31 PM;Which would explain their inconsistency;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:32 PM;Why the heck does the wikipedia page for AIC list them as having made the second movie as well?;;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:36 PM;Wiki's wrong sometimes. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø;;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:36 PM;"Or I might be wrong, could've been a collaborative effort or something.";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:38 PM;"Oh, I was wrong about P4A actually, that was AIC too. The game's cutscenes were by A1, that's where I got confused.";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:38 PM;"P4A was a pretty shoddy production too though, lots of weird errors.";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:38 PM;Like that part where they had two Chies https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90921/2096618-wat.png;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:39 PM;"Hey man, gotta have some spare Chie's for when one tries to kick an enemy that drains physical attacks";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 03:39 PM;Always good to have a backup.;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:40 PM;"Also, the placement is very different from the game, and they're missing Dojima";;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:41 PM;"Like, in the game, Rise is sitting to Yu's right, and Kanji is standing to Rise's right";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:43 PM;I liked P4 animation all things considered;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:43 PM;at least was historically correct;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 03:43 PM;unlike Golden;;
Davkilla101#0932;25-Apr-18 03:43 PM;"Yu was pretty funny in the animation, tbh";;

La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 04:31 PM;A-1 didn‚Äôt do Persona 4 A;;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 04:31 PM;"A-1 did P4G animation, the last 2? Persona 3 movies and of course P5A";;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 04:31 PM;Some other studio did P4A;;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 04:40 PM;"Yeah, it was AIC, I corrected myself. I got mixed up 'cause A-1 did the game's cutscenes and I can't read.";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 04:40 PM;"I think all the adaptations are kinda trash tho, regardless of studio. Games don't translate to anime well.";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 04:41 PM;"I like the 3 movies 'cause they're presented really well with great visuals and music, but they really rush the story and character development 'cause they're cutting a 50-60 hour game into like 8 hours of movie.";;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 04:58 PM;Wwhaaaat;;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 04:59 PM;You didn‚Äôt like P4A???;;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 04:59 PM;I find it really funny;;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 05:12 PM;"I liked the music and how they handled Yu, but not much else, I thought everything else about it was kinda mediocre";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 05:13 PM;"I'm not really a fan of P4's story to begin with, and awkwardly compressing it down to just 24 episodes didn't help that at all";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Apr-18 05:18 PM;I like how they crammed the first dungeon of P5 into three episodes;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:19 PM;i love p4a;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:19 PM;but I also love p4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:19 PM;but in general I thought the animation was pretty entertaining I guess;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Apr-18 05:21 PM;I prefer the story of P3;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Apr-18 05:21 PM;But I think that's just cuz I'm an edgy teen;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:26 PM;storywise I like P3 and Innocent Sin the most;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:26 PM;least favorites storywise are 1 and 5;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:27 PM;"the remaining P4, and EP I'm somewhat neutral on for the most part";;
Leon#9542;25-Apr-18 05:30 PM;I mostly agree with that. I'd swap 4 and 5 around though.;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:37 PM;I suppose I could see where why;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 05:38 PM;"it's my fav but definitely story is nothing worth writing home about, didn't care for it that much which is why it is just neutral for me";;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Apr-18 05:47 PM;The tone in 4 was just spot on though;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Apr-18 05:48 PM;It's hard to pinpoint which of the 6 persona games are my favorite;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 06:03 PM;I thought you said 5 was your favorite;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 06:04 PM;or was that someone else idk;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;25-Apr-18 06:04 PM;too many of you have that avatar;;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 06:09 PM;5 is my favorite;;
La Justice#5521;25-Apr-18 06:09 PM;I just relate with it the most though;;
Thelitedragon#4507;25-Apr-18 07:22 PM;I might have said it's my favorite gameplay wise;;

Silver Haku#5279;09-May-18 07:50 PM;I really have no clue;;
La Justice#5521;09-May-18 08:35 PM;Quadtrilogy;;
La Justice#5521;09-May-18 08:35 PM;There‚Äôs a fourth one;;
La Justice#5521;09-May-18 08:35 PM;Next year;;
La Justice#5521;09-May-18 08:35 PM;May 2019;;
action warrior#8892;09-May-18 08:35 PM;Infinity War and the next one are like one story arc though;;
action warrior#8892;09-May-18 08:36 PM;Like it is basically infinity war part two even though they changed the name;;
La Justice#5521;09-May-18 08:36 PM;Still separate movies;;
action warrior#8892;09-May-18 08:36 PM;In all but the name they are two parts of the same story;;
action warrior#8892;09-May-18 08:37 PM;Like matrix reloaded/revolutions;;

MajorBroski#8359;10-May-18 01:14 PM;And they both died;;
MajorBroski#8359;10-May-18 01:14 PM;lol;;
Silver Haku#5279;10-May-18 01:16 PM;Only ones I watched were Logan and Deadpool;;
Silver Haku#5279;10-May-18 01:16 PM;And I'm not entirely sure you can say Logan is a superhero movie;;
MajorBroski#8359;10-May-18 01:17 PM;"I did like the Dark Knight, but lets be honest....";;
MajorBroski#8359;10-May-18 01:17 PM;Those were just good movies in general;;
La Justice#5521;10-May-18 01:31 PM;The best super hero movie is obviously Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back;;
Dinoken2#0946;10-May-18 06:33 PM;Spiderman and Black Panther have sequels being produced.  Neither are staying dead.;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;10-May-18 06:38 PM;How;;
Silver Haku#5279;10-May-18 07:23 PM;Groot died;;
Silver Haku#5279;10-May-18 07:23 PM;Bad movie;;
action warrior#8892;11-May-18 06:35 AM;Groot died twice now lol;;
Dinoken2#0946;11-May-18 03:59 PM;"In the comics, they call Adam Warlock (the guy teased at the end of Guardians 2) and he comes and helps them beat up Thanos.  Nebula gets the Infinity Gauntlet as a result and undoes all the death.  , , I predict that in Avengers 4, Thanos' actions will attract Lady Death who will attack the half of the universe that lived.   The Avengers will try and fail to stop her.  They will seek out Thanos and be like Look at what you've done, this isn't balance!  Thanos will either agree and join up with them, or fall in love with Lady Death like he is in the comics.  Somehow someway, Cap or Iron Man get the gauntlet and brings back everyone who died.  Lady Death fades from our reality because of this, the gauntlet breaks, and the revived Avengers take out Thanos once and for all.  Also at some point Cap, Iron Man, and possibly Thor/Hulk will die.";;
Silver Haku#5279;11-May-18 04:18 PM;What's the point of trying to make an emotional story if there are no consequence and you can just bring back anyone;;
Dinoken2#0946;11-May-18 09:39 PM;Welcome to comic books in general.;;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 12:49 AM;"Yeah, but according to interviews with some of the producers, it seems like there might be more consequence than many fans might guess. Seems like phase 4 is going to be pretty different, so it's possible they might move away from the comic trope of no one really dies";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 12:52 AM;"Also, James Gunn pretty much confirmed that Adam Warlock won't be in avengers 4";;
Joie#2226;12-May-18 12:53 AM;Very possible and likely that captain marvel will be the trump card;;
action warrior#8892;12-May-18 01:39 AM;Warlock is gonna be introduced in guardians 3;;
action warrior#8892;12-May-18 01:39 AM;Captain marvel is clearly gonna take his place in avengers 4;;
MajorBroski#8359;12-May-18 08:24 AM;This is why I don't like these movies;;
MajorBroski#8359;12-May-18 08:24 AM;Or comics;;
action warrior#8892;14-May-18 12:29 AM;Why;;
HansCass#1930;14-May-18 08:56 PM;I just finished part 6 of Jojo;;
HansCass#1930;14-May-18 08:56 PM;And God damn that ending was really sad;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;14-May-18 08:57 PM;"It's just sad how fuckin, Araki decided to kill off everyone";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;14-May-18 08:57 PM;Even the main protag of Part 6;;
HansCass#1930;14-May-18 08:58 PM;Yeah;;

MajorBroski#8359;21-May-18 12:08 AM;It was...okay.;;
MajorBroski#8359;21-May-18 12:09 AM;"I actually kind of liked it, but I did everything I wanted it to do.";;
MajorBroski#8359;21-May-18 12:09 AM;"The thing I didnt like was the cheesy jokes, and predictable plot points. (Like most super hero movies)";;
Joie#2226;21-May-18 03:53 AM;i actually think the vulture plot twist was dope;;
Joie#2226;21-May-18 03:54 AM;"spider man is inherently campy, but i think this was one of the better iterations of the dude";;
Dinoken2#0946;21-May-18 08:00 AM;"The thing is Spiderman, much more so than the other heroes, is supposed to be quippy and full of lame jokes.";;
action warrior#8892;21-May-18 11:10 AM;@MajorBroski#8359 yeah it isn't amazing or anything but better than some of the other spiderman films;;
action warrior#8892;21-May-18 11:10 AM;And what dino said about the corny jokes;;

Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:07 PM;"So, how does it work";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:07 PM;well speaking solely of the SEBEC route for the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:08 PM;it takes place not in a dream but in Maki's ideal version of the world;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:08 PM;or really just that city;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:08 PM;So does that happen in the first part of the game?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:08 PM;yeah you end up being thrown into her world early on;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:09 PM;and you're there for most of the game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:09 PM;with a few cases of returning back to the real world;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:10 PM;"basically Kandori, one of the main antagonists helped in creating this device I think it's called the Deva System or something like that which allows you to create alternate realities";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:11 PM;Ah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:11 PM;somehow the machine picked up on Maki and that's how the SEBEC route ended up how it did;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:11 PM;What about the Night Queen route?;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:12 PM;"Snow Queen Quest I don't know much about unfortunately, since I never bothered to do it";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:12 PM;as much as I like P1 I can only handle the game once every now and then;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:12 PM;it's THAT taxing on you;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:12 PM;but I'll be doing it soon;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:12 PM;start with SEBEC though;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:12 PM;"So it's like worth playing, but then again, not so much at this point?";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:13 PM;It's worth playing but P1 is just a chore of a game;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:13 PM;"high encounter rates, lots of repetition";;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:13 PM;I still can't believe they made Mark black in the US version;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:14 PM;Honestly that would fit his personality;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:14 PM;"Though, if they did keep that";;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:14 PM;there is a line in the game's script;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:15 PM;where Nanjo calls Mark a monkey (as a joke but kinda an insult as well);;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:15 PM;and yeah;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:15 PM;you can't have shit that if the character is black;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:17 PM;that they stole;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:17 PM;from the police station iirc;;
Joot Doot Lhasa Apso#6440;19-Jun-18 06:17 PM;"Oh shit, really?";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:17 PM;in Persona 5 they were using Toy guns but whenever they were in the palace the toy guns behaved like real guns even though they were just replicas;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 06:17 PM;but in P1 they got the real deal;;

La Justice#5521;19-Jun-18 07:38 PM;But I highly doubt you'd get a Vita anytime soon;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 07:49 PM;I mean the original game is perfectly fine;;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;19-Jun-18 07:50 PM;otherwise I'd recommend getting a Vita anyway since you'd have access to the rest of the games besides 5;;

Silverx1987#9781;02-Aug-18 07:33 PM;"When Vision gets stabbed for the very first time (although he also gets stabbed again towards the ending), When Captain America and gang enters to save the day, when Gamora dies, the battle that happens in Wakanda, When Vision dies (which was supposedly an epic scene, only to be brought back by time magic thing), when Thor creates his axe. There's so many of these scenes, but it bounces back between the quest fetches. Like when you feel that intensified moment when Thor is doing to create his axe, but then nearly dies with the Groot thing, and then it bounces back to the battle in Wakanda.";;

!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-18 12:10 AM;"on PC though, the game was a mess";;
Emiruko#0314;04-Dec-18 12:10 AM;I played on PS4;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-18 12:10 AM;and they still have not delivered the fixes they promised;;
Emiruko#0314;04-Dec-18 12:11 AM;probably still runs better than Drakengard 3;;
!-Jisoo of the Common World-!#8403;04-Dec-18 12:11 AM;so it became a community effort to fix the game for them as best as they could;;
Leon#9542;04-Dec-18 02:45 AM;"You can actually play 9S similarly to 2B if you want, but the game doesn't tell you that. He has heavy attacks that you can use if you delay button presses between regular attacks, which up his DPS a fair amount so you don't have to rely on hacking so much to do any damage.";;
Leon#9542;04-Dec-18 02:46 AM;"Still not quite as fun or flashy as 2B, but using them gives you a good break from the minigames (which I personally didn't mind much, but I understand why people got sick of them fast)";;
Leon#9542;04-Dec-18 02:47 AM;"And yeah, Automata is still broken on PC. They're releasing a game of the year edition sometime soon and people think they'll fix it for that, but I really doubt it and even if they do, it's far too late.";;
Leon#9542;04-Dec-18 02:48 AM;"Would be nice if they did tho, I would love to be able to recommend this game to people without worrying that it'll just not work on their PC at all.";;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 03:07 AM;"Ahhhh, interesting";;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 03:07 AM;And broken in what way?;;
Izwar Vain#5689;04-Dec-18 03:07 AM;Because I *am* playing on PC;;
Leon#9542;04-Dec-18 01:55 PM;"It works fine for some people, but for others it has pretty severe performance issues and needs fan-made patches to be playable 'cause Square haven't patched it a single time since it came out";;

Izwar Vain#5689;24-Dec-18 06:04 AM;WHY IS THIS NOT IN THE GAME;;
Zenkure#1365;26-Dec-18 12:42 PM;Ah Dragon Age Origins. Would you like to visit the long ass section with the dwarves? Or maybe slog your way through the Fade in the Circle Tower??;;
Zenkure#1365;26-Dec-18 12:42 PM;I don't blame people for not beating that game. It's a slog to go through.;;
Emiruko#0314;26-Dec-18 12:45 PM;I only didn't finish because the last fight crashed my ps3 repeatedly;;
AceTofuDelivery#1284;26-Dec-18 08:26 PM;I think I gave up after I was in the fade for a while;;
Zenkure#1365;27-Dec-18 10:17 AM;"Ah, that sucks. Didn't get to see some of your choices play out at the ending.";;
Zenkure#1365;27-Dec-18 10:17 AM;"Origins is still worth playing at least once tho, it's definitely one of the more competent games from Bioware";;

Emiruko#0314;27-Dec-18 05:32 PM;Me too. Hunting for me is just running stuff over with my horse rn. Or chasing it with a knife;;

Izwar Vain#5689;29-Dec-18 11:13 AM;How;;
MajorBroski#8359;29-Dec-18 11:14 AM;"Well. Part of the movie, they posses individuals to do their bidding. So these individuals can break open doors and what not.

MajorBroski#8359;29-Dec-18 11:16 AM;"As far as lore, they are probably strictly spiritual entities that are limited to physical boundaries. So, while they come onto earth (for unknown reasons) they are still limited by the physical means on earth. Like, they can't go through walls and what not.";;

MajorBroski#8359;29-Dec-18 11:34 AM;Well. If you want to talk about in plot gaps of death note. The easiest could be L's unreasonable conclusions just to forward the plot.;;

Izwar Vain#5689;30-Dec-18 04:42 AM;You can ask him if you're keen;;
Malfred#1000;30-Dec-18 05:20 AM;Can't really say that they're all that exciting tbh;;
Malfred#1000;30-Dec-18 05:21 AM;"I think the majority of people are sitting on what they know till release, since right now it'll be easy to bring criminal charges on them";;
Doctor_Vile#6548;30-Dec-18 05:21 AM;criminal charges for a game?;;

Malfred#1000;30-Dec-18 05:24 AM;Not because it would be the moral thing to do;;

Malfred#1000;30-Dec-18 06:27 AM;In this case it has worked in their favour though;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Dec-18 06:27 AM;Oh really;;
Izwar Vain#5689;30-Dec-18 06:27 AM;That's an interesting move;;
